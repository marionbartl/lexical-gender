    "Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)": "\"Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)\" is a song by American rock band Awolnation. It was released as the lead single from their second studio album Run (2015). The song became their first number-one hit on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in early 2015. Band frontman Aaron Bruno has stated in interviews that he wishes the album track \"Windows\" would have been the first single, but the choice of the first single was a collaborative effort between the record company and himself and he found it easiest to just work to a middle ground.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nThe video for \"Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)\" was shot in one take by director Hayley Young in Seattle, WA. It was uploaded to the Red Bull Records' YouTube page on January 26, 2015. The video starts showing few actors and then the camera locks on frontman Aaron Bruno, it becomes focused on him throughout the video, capturing his movements, and correlation of facial expressions in regards to the lyrics. Bruno then walks into a sea of people, as the electro rock element implements several scenes, and he is seen dancing casually as he continues to walk and sing.\n\n\n== Track listings ==\n\"Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)\" \u2013 4:19\n\"Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)\" [Unlimited Gravity Remix] \u2013 4:59\n\"Hollow Moon (Bad Wolf)\" [Goshfather & Jinco Remix] \u2013 4:00\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Bescot Yard": "Bescot Yard is a railway yard in Bescot, a suburb of Walsall in the West Midlands, operated by DB Cargo UK. The yard is the major freight yard of the region, handling all of the rail freight movements and most of the railfreight traffic around the West Midlands.\n\n\n== History ==\nBescot is on the Walsall Line between Birmingham New Street and Walsall, part of the former Grand Junction Railway, opened in 1837. It was built to handle the coal and industrial traffic associated with the West Midlands. In April 1966, a remodelled Bescot Yard was opened which was capable of handling over 4,000 wagons daily.Traffic from the West Midlands Domestic Coal network was diverted away from Bescot to Washwood Heath sidings in July 1987. This allowed for extra capacity at Bescot.Bescot TMD is to the north-west of the yard. This entire complex of track is clearly visible from the northern end of the M6 and M5 motorway junction.\n\n\n== Present ==\nAfter closure of the 1950s developed hump shunting yard, freight since the 2008 credit crunch have declined significantly, and the associated Bescot TMD now carries no allocation of locomotives. Washwood Heath sidings were closed to freight trains in the latter half of 2008 and all residual services were transferred back to Bescot yard.DB Schenker services workings are still the mainstay of operations in the area, Direct Rail Services nuclear flask trains pass once or twice a week, and Freightliner Group Intermodal and Automotive trains also pass through. Regular Freightliner Coal trains also ran around on the up goods on their way to Rugeley Power Station prior to the closure of the power station in 2016.\nThe yard can be viewed in operation from Bescot Stadium railway station, served by West Midlands Trains.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of rail yards\nRail transport in Great Britain\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nRhodes, Michael (1988).

    "Trade in services statistics": "Trade in services statistics are economic statistics which detail international trade in services. They  received a great deal of focus at the advent of services negotiations which took place under the Uruguay Round, which became part of the General Agreement on Trade in Services, one of the four principal pillars of the World Trade Organization (WTO) trade treaty, also called the \"WTO Agreement\".\nThe General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) Four Modes of Supply comprises:\n\nMode 1 Cross border trade, which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country;\nMode 2  Consumption abroad - this mode covers supply of a service of one country to the service consumer of any other country;\nMode 3  Commercial presence - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country in the territory of any other country, i.e., foreign direct investment undertaken by a service provider;\nMode 4  Presence of natural persons - which covers services provided by a service supplier of one country through the presence of natural persons in the territory another economy.Statistics which correspondent to the GATS Four Modes of Supply comprise quantitative data addressing:\n\nTrade in services, which is defined as delivery of a service from the territory of one country into the territory of other country, specific disaggregation as per GATS Four Modes of Supply may not apply, i.e., this depends on decisions taken by each country;\nForeign direct investment (FDI)  Cross-border foreign investment as per International Monetary Fund guidelines.

Most countries don't have information which details trade as per the GATS Four Modes of Supply, which makes trade negotiations in this realm difficult, especially for developing country WTO members.  The United States Bureau of Economic analysis produces rich statistics in this area, but they do not address the GATS Four Modes of Supply directly, rather, they address only cross-border services, generally defined, and statistics related to FDI.

    "PKMS": "The PK (Russian: \u041f\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0451\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430, transliterated as Pulemyot Kalashnikova, or \"Kalashnikov's machine gun\"), is a belt-fed general-purpose machine gun, chambered for the 7.62\u00d754mmR rimmed cartridge. \nDesigned in the Soviet Union and currently in production in Russia, the original PK machine gun was introduced in 1961 and the improved PKM variant was introduced in 1969. The PKM was designed to replace the SGM and RP-46 machine guns that were previously in Soviet service. \nThe weapon remains in use as a front-line infantry and vehicle-mounted weapon with Russia's armed forces and has also been exported extensively and produced in several other countries under license.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Main Artillery Directorate of the Soviet Union (GRAU) adopted specification requirements for a new 7.62 mm general-purpose company and battalion-level machine gun that was to be chambered for a rifle cartridge in 1955. \nIn 1958 a machine gun prototype, developed by G.I. Nikitin and Yuri M. Sokolov, successfully passed field tests. Based on the results of the tests it was decided in 1960 to manufacture a batch of Nikitin-Sokolov machine guns for service tests and then put the machine gun into production at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant. However, when the Nikitin-Sokolov machine gun was almost completed, a team of Izhevsk Mechanical Plant designers, headed by M.T. Kalashnikov, and further consisting of V.V. Krupin, V.N. Pushchin, A.D. Kryakushin, as well as Startsev, Kamzolov, Koryakovtsev, Yuferev, joined the competition. Their machine gun prototype was based on the well-proven gas-operated rotary-bolt design of the Kalashnikov-pattern arms. \nThe Kalashnikov and the Nikitin-Sokolov prototypes underwent service tests in the Central Asian, Odessa, and Baltic Military Districts, as well as at the Vystrel officer training courses in late 1960. The Main Missiles and Artillery Directorate and the Ministry of the Defence Industry preferred the Kalashnikov design. The Kalashnikov design was found to be more reliable and cheaper to manufacture than the design of Grigory Nikitin and Yuri Sokolov. \nThe PK/PKS was put into production at the Kovrov Mechanical Plant and used the tripod mount and an ammunition belt boxes originally designed for the Nikitin-Sokolov prototype machine gun.\nNikitin's and Sokolov's machine gun design was later used in the 12.7 mm NSV heavy machine gun that was put into production in 1971.\n\n\n== Design details ==\nThe original PK was a development of Kalashnikov's AKM assault rifle and the accompanying RPK light machine gun design that featured stamped receivers. The PK uses the 7.62\u00d754mmR Eastern Bloc standard cartridge that produces significantly more bolt thrust when compared to the Eastern Bloc 7.62\u00d739mm and 5.45\u00d739mm intermediate cartridges.\n\n\n=== Operating mechanism ===\n\nThe bolt and carrier design are similar to the AK-47 and other modernized Kalashnikov-pattern weapons, as is the stripping procedure performed to remove those mechanisms from the gun for cleaning. The bolt and bolt carrier are however oriented upside down compared to the AKM, with the piston and gas system being underneath the barrel.\nUnlike the AKM and RPK the PK machine gun series is an open bolt design, which improves heat management during automatic fire compared to closed bolt designs and helps avoiding the dangerous phenomenon known as \"cook-off\", wherein the firing chamber becomes so hot that the propellant contained in a chambered round unintentionally ignites, making the weapon fire until the ammunition is exhausted. Open bolt designs typically operate much cooler than closed bolt designs due to the airflow allowed into the chamber, action and barrel during pauses between bursts, making them more suitable for constant full-automatic weapons such as machine guns. General-purpose machine guns like the PK are further normally issued with several quick change barrels that during prolonged intense use are swapped out allowing one barrel to cool while the machine gun fires with the other.\nThe rimmed 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridges are set in a metal ammunition belt and are held against the shoulder inside non disintegrating looped links, leaving the rim exposed at the rear. The belt is mounted from the right side into the feedway of the PK machine gun. The PK uses a non-reciprocating charging handle on the right side of the receiver to charge the gun. Since the PK uses a rimmed rifle cartridge and closed-link belts used for feeding, a two-stage feed mechanism with a preliminary extraction of a cartridge from a belt link was preferred over a direct ammunition feed design often used for rimmed cartridges. The PK machine gun is equipped with a lever-type feed mechanism, mounted on the feed cover and operated by the feed lever, mounted on the right wall of the receiver and wrapping around the bolt carrier with its feed pawl and roller. The PK feed mechanism pulls the rimmed 7.62\u00d754mmR cartridges out from the back of the ammunition belt and drops the cartridges down into the feed way, allowing the bolt to strip and feed the cartridges into the chamber for firing.\nThe PK feed mechanism is radically different from that of machine guns based on the MG 42 feed mechanism, designed with a much larger (and therefore much heavier) articulated feed cam, lever, and pawl assembly that pushes rimless cartridges out forward from their links directly into the chamber for firing.\nThe breech is locked by a rotating bolt, with two locking lugs engaging locking recesses in the receiver. The gas piston is hinged to the bolt carrier assembly, and its vertical travel makes it possible to bend the group making machine gun assembly and disassembly for maintenance easier. The protruding rear part of the bolt carrier assembly features spiral shaped cuts, which provide a controlled rotation of the bolt. The mainspring is accommodated in the bolt carrier assembly slide channel. A cartridge extractor with a latch is mounted in the rear part of the bolt carrier assembly. The cocking lever, mounted on the right, is not integral with the bolt carrier and does not reciprocate as the gun fires.\nThe machine gun fires from the rear sear.\nThe gas cylinder is mounted under the barrel and fitted with a gas regulator with three fixed positions. The gas regulator opens corresponding holes to change the amount of expanding propellant gases bled off out of the gas cylinder into the atmosphere, thus varying the amount of energy transferred on to the long-stroke piston.\n\n\n=== Receiver ===\nThe PK general-purpose machine gun U-shaped receiver is stamped from a smooth 1.5 mm (0.06 in) sheet of steel that is supported extensively by pins and rivets. For additional rigidity and strength the PK receiver features double walls made from 1.5 mm steel plates that are welded together with the U-shaped stamping. The receiver top cover is also stamped from 1.5 mm sheet metal and hinged on the front of the receiver and locked at the back with a spring-loaded latch.\n\n\n=== Barrel ===\nThe quick detachable barrel assembly slides into the receiver and attaches by a barrel-lock. On the original PK it was partially fluted to increase rigidity and improve heat dissipation. The barrel-lock also regulates the gap between the breech face and the breech end of the barrel. PK barrels have a folding carry handle/grip that is positioned to the left of the receiver and is used to transport the weapon and quickly and safely change-out barrels to prevent barrel overheating. The bore is chrome-lined and features four right-hand grooves at a 240 mm (1 in 9.45 in) rifling twist rate. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a flash hider. The muzzle was normally equipped with a conical flash suppressor that added 53 mm (2.1 in) to the barrel and later a long slotted flash suppressor that added 72 mm (2.8 in) to the barrel. Later when the PKM variant was introduced the PK series barrel fluting was omitted and the muzzle device was changed to a shorter cylindrical slotted flash suppressor that added 40 mm (1.6 in) to the barrel. The PKM barrel assembly weighs 2.4 kg (5.3 lb) and can fire up to 400 rounds in rapid fire scenarios before it has to be replaced for another barrel or allowed to cool down to prevent unacceptable wear of the bore.\n\n\n=== Sights ===\n\n\n==== Iron sights ====\nThe rear sight assembly is riveted onto the receiver cover and consist of a square notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in 100 m (109 yd) increments from 100 to 1,500 m (109 to 1,640 yd) and includes a \"point-blank range\" battle zero setting corresponding to a 330 m (361 yd) zero. It is identical in design to the AKM and Mosin\u2013Nagant, except that it is oriented backwards with the notch forward and the hinge behind.  The iron sight line has a 663 mm (26.1 in) sight radius. Like the RPD rear sight, the PK rear sight also features full windage adjustment in the form of small dials on either side of the notch.\nThe front sight assembly is mounted near the end of the barrel and consists of a protected open post adjustable for elevation in the field.\n\n\n==== Optical sights ====\nPK machine guns that feature a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket on the left side of the receiver can mount various aiming optics. The standard Russian side rail mounted optical sight was the 4\u00d726 1P29 Universal sight for small arms, an aiming optic similar to the British SUIT and SUSAT and Canadian C79 optical sights. When mounted, the 1P29 sight is positioned centered above the receiver at a height that allows the use of the iron sights. It weighs 0.8 kg, offers 4\u00d7 magnification with a field of view of 8\u00b0 and 35 mm eye relief. The 1P29 is issued with a canvas pouch, a lens cleaning cloth, combination tool, two rubber eyecups, two eyecup clamps and three different bullet drop compensation (BDC) cams for the AK-74, RPK-74 and PK machine gun. The 1P29 is intended for quickly engaging point and area targets at various ranges. On the right side of the field of view a stadiametric rangefinder is incorporated that can be used to determine the distance from a 1.5 meters (4 ft 11.1 in) tall object from 400 to 1,200 m (437 to 1,312 yd). The reticle is an inverted aiming post in the top half of the field of view and is tritium-illuminated for low-light condition aiming. A later designed similar optical sight suitable for the PK machine gun series is the 4\u00d724 1\u042077\n\n\n=== Trigger ===\nThe trigger assembly, mounted inside the receiver, is operated by the mainspring and suitable for automatic fire. It has no single shot mode of fire. The manual rotating type safety locks the sear, which engages the sear notch of the bolt carrier assembly, and the trigger lug does not allow the bolt earner assembly to go all the way back.\n\n\n=== Stock ===\nThe skeletonized buttstock, pistol grip and folding carry handle/grip on the barrels were originally manufactured from birch plywood laminates. Such engineered woods are stronger and resist warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, do not require lengthy maturing, and are cheaper. The wooden furniture was finished with the Russian amber shellac finishing process. Small accessories and an oil-solvent container can be stored inside butt recesses. Later the buttstock was fitted with a hinged butt-rest. More recent PKM machine guns and barrel assemblies are equipped with a new black glass-filled polyamide buttstock, pistol grip and barrel carry handle/grip shaped like the previously used laminated wooden stock and grips.\n\n\n=== Feeding ===\n\nPK machine guns are belt-fed, using non-disintegrating metal belts, which have links that wrap around the cartridge case shoulder all the way around, and are linked by a coiling wire on each side. The links are made of 0.8 mm (0.03 in) thick high carbon stamped steel sheet metal that is zinc phosphated and varnished for protection. These belts are preloaded at ammunition factories in 25-round connectable belt lengths and can be linked to any length necessary. Factory connected PK ammunition belts are available in 25, 100, 200 and 250 rounds lengths. Typical of Soviet machine guns, the PK feeds from the right and ejects its spent cases via an ejection port on the left side of the weapon, contrary to the right side ejection port seen in most Western machine guns.\nFor the light machine gun role, the PK is used as the standard squad automatic weapon of the Russian Army. The PK uses a 100-round non-disintegrating belt contained in a metal box made from an aluminium frame and steel cover that can be attached under the gun's receiver. The 100-round belt \"assault\" box has a folding lid in its cover for feeding the ammunition belt when the box is attached under the machine gun receiver and weighs 3.9 kg (8.60 lb) or 3.4 kg (7.50 lb) for the modernized all aluminium lightweight variant. When the machine gun is fired from a bipod, the 100-round ammunition box is normally attached to the underside of the receiver.\nFor the medium machine gun role, there is also a 200/250-round ammunition box made from an aluminium frame and steel cover available which can be mounted on the tripods used for the PK machine gun series. A 200/250-round ammunition box containing a 250-round non-disintegrating belt weighs 9.4 kg (20.72 lb) and containing a 200-round non-disintegrating belt weighs 8 kg (17.64 lb) or 6.2 kg (13.67 lb) for the modernized all aluminium lightweight variant. Both metal ammunition boxes have canvas carry handles.\nAll openings on the machine gun, particularly the ejector port on the left and the belt feed entrance on the right, are covered with spring-loaded dust covers so that the openings are only exposed when they need to be.\n\n\n=== Accessories ===\nThe PK is equipped with a simple detachable bipod mounted to the gas cylinder beneath the barrel and in that setup is used as a squad-level support weapon. The right bipod leg accommodates links of a cleaning rod. Other accessories include a sling and storage covers.\nThe PK machine gun is also suitable for installation on tripod mounts, vehicle mounting and can also be used as a light anti-aircraft weapon against slow flying aircraft when it is put on an AA mount.\nAs with all general-purpose machine guns, tripod and vehicle mountings offer a higher degree of accuracy and control than when used on a less stable bipod. The PK machine gun, firing short bursts from a bipod, as a light machine gun has the following accuracy of fire: a mean deviation of 7\u201310 cm (2.8\u20133.9 in) at a range of 100 m (109 yd), 37\u201351 cm (15\u201320 in) at 500 m (547 yd), and 71\u2013103 cm (28\u201341 in) at 1,000 m (1,094 yd). The Russian and other European militaries use a circular error probable method that assumes a 50% hit probability (R50).\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\n\n=== PKS ===\nFor heavier employment, the PKS (\"PK Mounted\") is based on the Samozhenkov 6T2 tripod mount. The PK and 6T2 tripod weigh 16.5 kg (36.38 lb).\nThe 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was designed by E. S. Samozhenkov and entered service in 1961 and weighs 7.5 kg (16.53 lb). The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was earlier envisioned for the Nikitin-Sokoiov machine gun that was not adopted by the Soviet Union. All types of ammunition belt boxes are carried and mounted separately. The Rakov device is used for loading ammunition belts. The PK machine gun is attached to a cradle on the 6T2 Samozhenkov mount. The cradle is hinged to a plug-in swivel equipped with a rack-and-pinion traversing mechanism, and a rod-and-screw elevation mechanism. The traversing mechanism is fitted with stops to limit the field of fire. For anti-aircraft fire or fire against ground targets from a kneeling position the cradle mounts a collapsible pole with a pivoting bracket. The mount features non-digging-in spades \u2014 sliding spades affect the accuracy of fire less than a \"jumping\" tripod with dug-in spades. There is an extra folding spade on the front leg for slippery and moving ground. Hinged tripod legs allow a gunner to fire the machine gun from a prone, a sitting, or a kneeling position.\nThe PKS machine gun, firing bursts from its tripod with fixed traversing and elevation mechanisms, as a medium machine gun has the following accuracy of fire: mean deviation of 5\u20136 cm (2.0\u20132.4 in) at a range of 100 m (109 yd), 25\u201329 cm (9.8\u201311.4 in) cm at 500 m (547 yd), and 49\u201368 cm (19\u201327 in) at 1,000 m (1,094 yd). The Russian and other European militaries use a circular error probable method that assumes a 50% hit probability (R50) and cannot be converted and is not comparable to US military methods for determining small arms accuracy. When the R50 results are doubled the hit probability increases to 93.7%.\n\n\n=== PKM ===\nThe PKM (\u041f\u041a \u041c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439: \"Kalashnikov's Machine-gun Modernized\"), was adopted into service in 1969. The PKM is a modernized, product-improved version of the PK. The upgrades, primarily aimed at reducing the weight, simplifying production, and facilitating easier operation. The receiver cover became more rigid due to lengthwise ribs. The butt was fitted with a hinged butt-rest. The barrel fluting was omitted and the flash hider was changed. Later on the PKM was equipped with a new black glass-filled polyamide buttstock and pistol grip shaped like the previously used laminated wooden stock and grip.\n\n\n=== PKMN ===\nThe PKMN (\u041f\u041a\u041c \u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439: \"PKM Night-Vision\") is a variant that can mount a night sight for low-visibility operations. The PKMN-1 can thus mount the multi-model NSPU-3 (1PN51) night vision scope while the PKMN-2 can mount the multi-model NSPUM (1PN58) night vision scope. It can also be fitted with the 1PN93 series passive night sights.\nBesides that Shakhin and 1PN116 thermal sights and the 1PN119 anti-sniper special-purpose night vision sight are available for mounting on PK machine guns that like the PKMN model feature a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket on the left side of the receiver for mounting aiming optics.\n\n\n=== PKMS ===\nFor heavier employment, the PKMS (\u041f\u041a\u041c \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439: \"PKM Mounted\") is mounted on the Stepanov 6T5 tripod mount. The PKM and 6T5 tripod weigh 12 kg (26.46 lb).\nThe tripod mount, designed by L. V. Stepanov for the PKM machine gun entered service in 1969 and weighs 4.5 kg (9.92 lb). It is a lighter mount for the PK(M) general-purpose machine gun without affecting the accuracy of fire. Besides, the Stepanov mount has 20 fewer components than the preceding Samozhenkov tripod and is 40% less labour-intensive. The Stepanov mount is based on a principle of multi-functional components: the elevation mechanism frame is also used as a pole for kneeled shooting or anti-aircraft fire; the base sleeve also serves as the axis for attaching rear legs of the tripod: the machine gun attachment is combined with the elevation mechanism frame lock for anti-aircraft fire; the fine elevation adjustment mechanism is integrated with the elevation mechanism axis. The ammunition belt box can be secured to the right rear tripod leg. This enables one crew member to carry and operate the gun in combat without having to unload the gun before repositioning the gun.\n\n\n=== PKMSN ===\nThe PKMSN (\u041f\u041a\u041c\u0421 \u041d\u043e\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439: \"PKMS Night-Vision\") is similarly to the PKMN a special model of the tripod-mounted variant that can mount night sights for low-visibility operations.\nThe PKMSN model can use NSPU-3 (1PN51) and NSPUM (1PN58) night sights. It can also be fitted with the 1PN93 series passive night sights.\nBesides that Shakhin and 1PN116 thermal sights and the 1PN119 anti-sniper special-purpose night vision sight are available for mounting on PK machine guns that like the PKMSN model feature a Warsaw Pact side-rail bracket on the left side of the receiver for mounting aiming optics.\n\n\n=== PKT ===\nThe PKT (\u041f\u041a \u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439, \"PK Tank\") (1968) is a solenoid-fired coaxial version of PK to replace the SGMT Goryunov vehicle-mounted machine gun. Modifications include the removal of the stock, a longer and heavier barrel, a gas regulator and an electric solenoid trigger. The PKT is usually fed from 250-round ammunition boxes. The PKT barrel assembly weighs 3.23 kg (7.1 lb) and can fire up to 500 rounds in rapid fire scenarios before it has to be replaced for another barrel or allowed to cool down to prevent unacceptable wear of the bore.\nIts ballistic performance with various ammunition types is stated as:\nR50 at 300 m (328 yd) means the closest 50% of the shot group will all be within a circle of the mentioned diameter at 300 m (328 yd).\n\n\n=== PKMT ===\nModernized version of PKT.\n\n\n=== PKB ===\nVersion on which a set of spade grips replace the stock, for mounting on roofs of vehicles.\n\n\n=== PKBM ===\nModernized version of PKB.\n\n\n=== PKP Pecheneg ===\n\nThe PKP Pecheneg (6P41) (2001) is a further development and modification of the PKM. It has a heavy fixed barrel encased in a radial cooling sleeve that uses forced-air cooling, much like the Lewis Gun of World War I.\n6P41N Pecheneg-NP version with a rail for mounting nightscopes.\nPecheneg-SP improved modernized version.\n\n\n== Foreign variants ==\n\n\n=== HCP PKM-\"NATO\" (Poland) ===\nIn the early 1990s, as part of the preparations to join NATO, the Polish armed forces were looking for a replacement for the PK-series machine guns then in service. The H. Cegielski - Pozna\u0144 S.A. Works in Pozna\u0144 modified the PK/PKS to feed standard 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridges and use NATO standard ammunition belts. The new model received the code-name PKM-NATO. The modifications included a heavier barrel, a larger chamber, and a redesign of the lock, extractor, and the entire feeding mechanism. The prototype was tested from 1997 to 1999, but was rejected. The Polish Army adopted the UKM-2000 machine gun instead \u2013 which was also based on the PKM.\n\n\n=== Zastava M84/M86/M09/M10 (Yugoslavia/Serbia) ===\nThe Zastava M84 is a Yugoslav/Serbian-made licensed copy of the PK/PKS. The Zastava M86 is a copy of the solenoid-triggered PKT. These variants can be easily recognised by their unhollowed stock.\nThe Zastava M09 is a copy of the PKM with black synthetic furniture, chambered in 5.56x45 NATO ammo. The Zastava M10 is a variant of the M09 with a solid stock.\n\n\n=== Norinco Type 80 (People's Republic of China) ===\nThe Type 80 is a Chinese-made copy of the PKM/PKMS.\n\n\n=== Arsenal MG, MG-M1, MG-M1S & MG-1M (Bulgaria) ===\nArsenal originally produced the MG, modeled after the original Russian PK model. The MG-M1 is a licensed copy of the PKM with a synthetic buttstock and pistol grip. The MG-M1S only differs from the MG-M1 model due to the use of a tripod by the M1S model, where as the M1 model uses the original bi-pod design. The MG-1M, an improved Squad Automatic Weapon variant, has improved features, such as a redesigned barrel that allows for better cooling.\n\n\n=== Cugir Mitraliera md. 66 (Romania) ===\nThe Mitraliera md. 66 is a Romanian-made copy of the PKM.\n\n\n=== KGK general purpose machine gun (Hungary) ===\nThe KGK universal (general purpose) machine gun was based on the SG43 Goryunov machinegun and produced in Hungary during the 1960s and 1970s. It was used by the Hungarian army on a limited scale and was later replaced by a domestically produced copy of the Kalashnikov PKM machine gun.\n\n\n=== Mayak KM-7.62, KT-7.62 and KTM-7.62 (Ukraine) ===\nThe Mayak KM-7,62 is a copy of the PKM, made to be lighter and easier to handle. It first appeared in 2011. The KT-7,62 and KTM-7,62 are copies of the PKT, first appearing in 2011.\n\n\n== Production status ==\nThe PKM and other variants are in production in Russia and are currently exported to many nations. Additionally, various models are manufactured locally around the globe. Zastava Arms produces the PK under license as the M84 (along with the PKT as the M86), and it remains in use with many of the former Yugoslav successor states. The most recent modification is the Russian Pecheneg, which features a forced air cooling barrel that cannot be removed in the field for quick replacement, unusual for a modern machine gun.\n\n\n== Users ==\n\n\n== Conflicts ==\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nVietnam War (1955\u20131975)\nSouth African Border War (1966\u20131990)\nCambodian Civil War (1968\u20131975)\nLebanese Civil War (1975\u20131990)\nLibyan\u2013Egyptian War (1977)\nCambodian\u2013Vietnamese War (1978\u20131989)\nChinese\u2013Vietnamese War (1979)\nSalvadoran Civil War (1979\u20131992)\nSoviet\u2013Afghan War (1979\u20131989)\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988)\nLord's Resistance Army insurgency (1987\u2013present)\nFirst Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988\u20131994)\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nTuareg rebellion (1990\u20131995)\nGulf War (1990\u20131991)\nSomali Civil War (1991\u2013present)\nYugoslav Wars (1991\u20132001)\nBurundian Civil War (1993\u20132005)\nFirst Chechen War (1994\u20131996)\nSecond Congo War (1998\u20132003)\nSecond Chechen War (1999\u20132009)\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nWar in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)\nIraqi conflict (2003\u2013present)\nCambodian\u2013Thai border dispute (2008\u20132011)\nRusso-Georgian War (2008)\nBoko Haram insurgency (2009\u2013present)\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nFirst Libyan Civil War (2011)\nSyrian Civil War (2011\u2013present)\nMali Civil War (2012\u2013present)\nWar in Donbas (2014\u2013present)\nSecond Libyan Civil War (2014\u2013present)\nYemeni Civil War (2014\u2013present)\nSaudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen (2015\u2013present)\nSaudi Arabian\u2013Yemeni border conflict (2015\u2013present)\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nNagorno-Karabakh War (2020)\nTigray War (2020\u2013present)\n\n\n== See also ==\nDaewoo Precision Industries K3\nFN EVOLYS\nFN MAG\nFN Maximi\nFN Minimi (M249 light machine gun)\nHK MG4\nHK MG5\nIWI Negev\nM60 machine gun\nPKP \"Pecheneg\"\nRPL-20\nSumitomo Type 62\nType 67 machine gun\nQJY-88\nQJY-201\nUltimax 100\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOriginal producer website\nModern Firearms\nModern Firearms\u2014Pecheneg\nhttp://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/637/nazvalsya-gruzdem.pdf\nhttp://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/32b/ot-PK-kPKM.pdf\nTechnical data, instructional images and diagrams of the PK machine gun (in Russian)\nVideo of operation on YouTube",

Originally the show was planned to be a multi-episode reality competition such as the original format of America's Next Top Model. However, after an unsuccessful attempt to gain the rights for the \nfranchise it was modeled as a competition that only lasted one evening. It took place on April 27, 2007. The event was held in London with prizes such as a contract with acclaimed agency Select Models and immediate booking for shows in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and others. Girls between 18 and 28 and who were at least 5'8 were allowed to compete.\nIn a pageant-style contest with fourteen chosen girls competing in order to win the title of Nigeria's Top Model.

    "John Aston Sr.": "John Aston (3 September 1921 \u2013 31 July 2003) was an English footballer.\nLike his son John Aston Jr., Prestwich-born Aston came through the Manchester United youth system and turned professional in December 1939. His debut for the club came almost seven years later, on 18 September 1946, against Chelsea. Aston was a strong, tough-tackling left-back who also played as a centre forward for his club on occasion. He won 17 England caps between 1948 and 1950, all at left-back, and featured in the 1950 FIFA World Cup. He played in the 1948 FA Cup Final triumph over Blackpool at Wembley Stadium. He left the club in 1954 after scoring 30 goals in 284 appearances.\nAston returned to the club as Youth Team coach in the early 1960s and was then Chief Scout under new manager Wilf McGuinness in 1969, and had a three-year spell in the position before being sacked along with McGuinness's successor, Frank O'Farrell in late 1972. Aston was also reserve team manager when McGuinness was manager, although McGuinness became reserve team manager again after he got sacked as manager in December 1970.\nAston died in July 2003 at the age of 81.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nManchester United\n\nFirst Division: 1951\u201352\nFA Cup: 1948\n\n\n== External links ==\nManchester United profile\nEngland profile\nObituary in The Independent\nObituary in The Times",
    "Canadian Stroke Network": "The Canadian Stroke Network (CSN) is a non-profit healthcare organization.\n\n\n== About ==\nThe Canadian Stroke Network is a not-for-profit, collaborative effort, with more than 100 researchers at 24 universities across Canada. It began in 1999, with $4.7 million in funding from the federal government. It is governed by a Board of Directors and has its headquarters at the University of Ottawa.\n\n\n== Research ==\nCSN researchers are involved in writing the Evidence-based Review of Stroke Rehabilitation (EBRSR), a resource that provides a review of the stroke rehabilitation research literature available. They also continue to enhance StrokEngine, a Web-based educational tool which offers an \"A to Z\" listing of every stroke rehabilitation intervention currently available in Canada.The CSN currently funds four themes of research:\nPreventing stroke\nOptimizing acute stroke care\nMinimizing stroke damage\nPost-stroke repair and recovery\n\n\n== Training and outreach ==\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nThe CSN, in partnership with the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, also produces the Canadian Best Practice Recommendations for Stroke Care, published as a website. In 2011, they released \"The Quality of Stroke Care in Canada\", a report that examined stroke care in Canada. Based on an audit of hospitals across Canada, the study looked at the quality of stroke care provided in emergency response, in-hospital care and in rehabilitation and recovery.The CSN wrote a book to support people living with stroke. The book, titled Getting on with the Rest of your Life After Stroke, provides suggestions of activities, exercises and hobbies for people recovering from a stroke.The Canadian Stroke Network was involved in the creation of the National Stroke Nursing Council in 2005, which brings together stroke nurses across Canada to improve training and development. Stroke Nursing News is the publication disseminated and funded by the Network.\n\n\n=== Sodium ===\nThe Canadian Stroke Network is a national leader in raising awareness about the health risks of excessive sodium consumption. The Network has publicized findings from studies involving CSN researchers and, with its partners, has successfully urged Health Canada to include information about salt in Canada's Food Guide. The CSN also created a website to inform Canadians about sodium content in food. The website called Sodium 101. A Sodium 101 app, created by the CSN, is available for the iPhone and iPad to further help people track their sodium consumption.\n\n\n=== Conferences and meetings ===\nEach year the CSN works in partnership with the Canadian Stroke Consortium and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada to host the Canadian Stroke Congress. This annual Congress brings together nearly a thousand delegates from various disciplines, including physicians, nurses, students and rehabilitation specialists. The inaugural Congress was held in Quebec City, Quebec in 2010, and was in Ottawa, Ontario the following year. The 2012 Congress will be hosted in Calgary, Alberta.\n\n\n== Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network ==\nThe Ontario Stroke Registry (formerly the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network (RCSN)) was established in 2001 to allow for the measurement and monitoring of stroke care delivery and outcomes in Canadian patients at participating institutions, and to serve as a rich clinical database for investigator-initiated research projects.  It is funded by the Canadian Stroke Network and the Ontario Ministry of Health.  In 2011, the governance of the RCSN was transferred from the Canadian Stroke Network to the Insititue for Clinical Evaluative Sciences and the name of the registry was changed to the Ontario Stroke Registry.\n\n\n=== Privacy and Data Security ===\nThe registry initially required informed patient consent for complete data collection and follow up interviews.  However, this proved to be costly and resulted in a non-representative sample of patients   This finding was of great importance in informing the debate around the need for patient consent for participation in clinical registries and anonymous databases. As a result of this finding, many jurisdictions now waive the requirement for informed consent for these purposes.  In 2005, it became a \u201cprescribed entity\u201d under Ontario\u2019s Personal Health Information Protection Act, permitting the collection of patient data without consent for the purposes of improving the provision of stroke care.  Since coming under the governance of the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in 2011, the Registry is no longer a \"prescribed person\" as it comes under ICES's status of a \"prescribed entity\".\n\n\n=== Methodology ===\nAll consecutive patients with a presumed diagnosis of acute stroke or Transient ischemic attack (including ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage) presenting within 14 days of stroke onset to a participating hospital are included in the registry. Case ascertainment is achieved prospectively by having dedicated nurse-coordinators keep daily logs of all new stroke / Transient ischemic attack admissions and emergency visits. Following hospital discharge, the study nurse reviews the patient\u2019s chart and enters the data into a touchscreen notebook computer using specialized software designed to increase data completeness and accuracy. Stripped of personal identifiers, encrypted data are then sent for analysis via telephone to a central data server at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto.\nThe content was decided after a series of meetings with many stakeholders including researchers; representatives from ministries of health and nonprofit stroke agencies (including the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada); healthcare providers; and stroke survivors. The collected data focus on time intervals between stroke onset and the delivery of care including thrombolysis, and include information on patient demographics, stroke type, stroke risk factors,  premorbid conditions, stroke severity, brain imaging,  treatments (including medications), and the utilization of stroke protocols/units.\nGiven that the data are collected from a select group of hospitals, a significant limitation of the RCSN is that the results may not be generalizable to the entire population of patients with acute stroke. To obtain population-based stroke data, a supplemental data collection is undertaken biannually \u2014 the Ontario Stroke Audit (OSA). Using the RCSN case record form and software, the OSA collected data on a random sample of all stroke and TIA patients presenting to all acute care hospitals in Ontario. Cases are determined retrospectively using appropriate International Classification of Disease (ICD), 10th revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes for stroke (I60, I61, I63, I64, and G45, excluding G45.4).\n\n\n=== SPIRIT ===\nSPIRIT  (Stroke Performance Indicators for Reporting, Improvement & Translation), is a web-based RCSN Stroke Registry that enables stroke-care providers the opportunity to enter data on stroke patients at the point of care in a timely manner. Data is securely transmitted to a central data repository for analysis and feedback.  The data is used to determine stroke care performance in real-time so that hospitals can monitor their own performance and compare themselves to other institutions.  The current SPIRIT module focuses on collecting data from Stroke Prevention Clinics and, in development, is the Acute Care SPIRIT module that will allow sites to enter data on their acute stroke patients including patients treated with Telestroke.  All data elements included in SPIRIT were derived from the Canadian Stroke Quality of Care Study and the Stroke Canada Optimization of Rehabilitation through Evidence project, which identified performance measures through a series of national consensus panels on stroke care delivery across parts of the continuum (acute care, secondary prevention, rehabilitation, telestroke).\nBy linking the data elements collected by SPIRIT to performance measures, continuous evaluation of provincial and national stroke care initiatives can occur. The data collected by SPIRIT can be used to inform stroke teams, administrators, provincial ministries of Health and other stakeholders to improve the quality of stroke care delivery. It will also facilitate coordination of knowledge translation and quality improvement projects across Canada.\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Ontario Stroke Registry)\nCanadian Stroke Network) Archived 2021-04-14 at the Wayback Machine\nNetworks of Centres of Excellence\nInstitute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences\nHeart and Stroke Foundation of Canada\n\"Impracticability of informed consent in the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network\" Tu et al.

    "Diebold Schilling the Elder": "Diebold Schilling the Elder  (c. 1445\u20131485) was the author of several of the Swiss illustrated chronicles, the Berner Schilling of 1483, the Spiezer Schilling (1480s), and the Z\u00fcrcher Schilling of 1484. \nHe worked in Lucerne as a chancellor. In 1460, he moved to Berne for a post as a scribe to the city council. He was to some extent hostile towards the European powers who needed a lot of Swiss mercenaries: this could only bring internal troubles after the Burgundy wars.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDiebold Schilling the Younger\nSwiss illustrated chronicles\n\n\n== External links ==\nBerne chronicle facsimile\nSpiez chronicle facsimile",
    "Christ Temple AME Zion Church": "Christ Temple AME Zion Church, also known as Belmont Annex Fellowship Hall, is a historic African-American church at 235 E. Meeting Street in Dandridge, Tennessee.\nThe church's building was originally located in southwestern Dandridge, immediately behind the Bethel Presbyterian Church. It was built circa 1888. In 1912 the congregation was rededicated as Christ Temple AME Zion, and the name and date were recorded on a rectangular marble stone installed in the foundation.In 1935 the church was relocated when its site was acquired by the Jefferson County Board of Education to make room for construction of a new white-only segregated school that was to be built through a New Deal program. The school board bought the site at East Meeting Street and Lake Drive from an African-American Missionary Baptist congregation, and traded that property to the Christ Temple AME Zion congregation in exchange for the AME Zion church's site, so the new school could be built on the former AME Zion church property. The church's building was moved to the new site and rebuilt; the rebuilt building included parts of the 1888 building, but likely contained some new materials and elements. It is a single-story gable-front church building on a brick foundation, with weatherboard siding and a metal-covered roof.  It has an arched recessed entranced with two-pane square windows on either side. There is a wood ventilation grille above the entrance at the gable point of the facade.The church ended regular operations in 2002, when only five active members remained in the congregation. Its building became an annex of Belmont AME Zion Church, which is located on Swannsylvania Road in Jefferson County.The church building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. At the time of the listing, there were plans to remove carpet, fake pine paneling, and a dropped ceiling that had been installed in the church interior around 1970.\n\n\n== References ==",

He spent his early childhood in an Arab world, before his family moved to France in 1925, first to Paris and then to Nice.He was hired by Life in 1936 and his first assignment was to cover Edward VIII's opening of Parliament. His pictures were included in the magazine's first issue (on November 23, 1936) and he went on to cover many events of the Second World War. He photographed Yugoslav guerrilla leader Draza Mihailovich in June 1946 during his Communist show trial in Belgrade. He shot the last images of Antoine de Saint Exupery in 1944.  Saint Exupery, days before he disappeared, gave Phillips a manuscript, \"Letter to an American [1]\" which Phillips eventually donated to France.\nJohn Phillips has been described as the \"grand-godfather of photo-journalism, a master of lenses and multiple languages; elegant, exuberant and chrome-steel effectual, who has recorded in his own peripatetic way some of the freshest footprints of history.\"\nHe had almost completed his autobiography when he died.  The book was published posthumously by Scalo as \"Free Spirit in a Troubled World\"In 2010 the United States Postal Service issued a stamp commemorating WW II cartoonist Bill Mauldin.

    "Christian K\u00f8lle": "Christian K\u00f8lle (15 August 1736 \u2013 30 January 1814) was a Norwegian educator and theologian known for his at-the-time innovative views on written Norwegian that preceded many of the later language reforms.\n\n\n== Background ==\nHe was born in Kristiania to government official (kansellir\u00e5d) Jens K\u00f8lle and his wife Catharine Hermine Juell. He attended the Christiania Cathedral School, enrolled as a student in 1755 and graduated with a cand.theol. degree in 1760. He applied for various clergical positions in Denmark, but was never appointed supposedly because of closeness with the Moravian Church. He instead worked as a private tutor in Kr\u00e5kstad, Fj\u00e6re and Arendal. In 1770 he bought the farm Snar\u00f8en and ran his own boarding school.\n\n\n== Career ==\nK\u00f8lle wrote several of the textbooks used in his school. In some of these books, he employed linguistic ideas that preceded many actual language reforms in Norway. He emphasized \"purely Norwegian\" words in books, and argued for more phonemic orthography in the written language. In an anonymous work released in 1785 he introduced the written feminine grammatical gender in Norway, unheard of in the Danish written culture of the day, but often used in orally Norwegian. He also introduced a precursor to the letter \"\u00e5\" instead of \"aa\". Following the model of the letter \u00f8, which was an o with a slash through it, he chose the character \u2c65 (a with a slash through it), to replace aa. Although he preferred to use \u2c65, he used \u00e5 or a\u0364 (a with superscript o or e) when this type was not available.His principles were attacked by J. J. Vangensten in Norway's first newspaper Norske Intelligenz-Sedler, and by Jens Kragh H\u00f8st in the Danish Ki\u00f8benhavnske Efterretninger om l\u00e6rde Sager, both in 1796. A rebuttal by K\u00f8lle was printed in both publications in 1797. He was a predecessor of later language reformers, including Rasmus Rask and Knud Knudsen. The letter \u00e5 eventually became introduced in Norwegian in 1917, and written feminine grammatical gender also became a reality.\nK\u00f8lle released the topographical pamphlet K\u00e5rt Beskrivelse over Snar\u00f8en, en liden G\u00e5rd ved Christiania in 1792. The pamphlet is a useful historical source on Snar\u00f8en (now: Snar\u00f8ya), and also contained a section of farmer's advice. The pamphlet was embedded with an issue of Norske Intelligenz-Sedler. In 1794 he released the Enlightenment-typical book \u00c6r d\u00e6t F\u00e5rnuftigt at have Religion? \u00e5k Vilken av s\u00e5 mange \u00e6r d\u00e6n F\u00e5rnuftigste?. Both publications were written in his own phonemic orthography. In 1805 he released an autobiography.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was married to Elisabeth Monrad (1758\u20131829), who was a sister of Lars Monrad (1762\u20131836), owner of a noted pharmacy in Bergen.\nThey had three daughters. One of them, Catharine Hermine K\u00f8lle (1788\u20131859), is known as both the first female hiker and the first female painter in Norway. Christian K\u00f8lle sold the farm in 1803, and moved with his family to Kopervik, a place which he considered safer in the event of war. He had intended to move to Strandebarm, then changed his mind, but soon became dissatisfied with Kopervik as well. They moved on to Ulvik in 1805, where he again opened a small learning institution. He died at his farm in 1814, and his wife died in 1829 in Os, Hordaland. In modern times, a road at Snar\u00f8ya was named after him.\n\n\n== External links ==\nKort Beskrivelse over Snar\u00f8en, en liten Gaard ved Christiania (in Norwegian)\n\u00c6r d\u00e6t F\u00e5rnuftigt at have Religion? \u00e5k Vilken av s\u00e5 mange \u00e6r d\u00e6n F\u00e5rnuftigste?

    "Winston Science Fiction": "Winston Science Fiction was a series of 37 American juvenile science fiction books published by the John C. Winston Company of Philadelphia from 1952 to 1960 and by its successor Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1960 and 1961. It included 35 novels by various writers, including many who became famous in the SF field, such as Poul Anderson, Arthur C. Clarke, Ben Bova, and Lester del Rey. There was also one anthology, The Year After Tomorrow, edited by del Rey and others. There was one non-fiction book Rockets Through Space: The Story of Man's Preparations to Explore the Universe by del Rey which details the factual science and technology of rocket flight. Many of the dust jackets became science fiction classics; the artists included Hugo Award winners Ed Emshwiller and Virgil Finlay along with Hugo nominees such as Mel Hunter and Alex Schomburg.\n\n\n== Background ==\nJuvenile science fiction hard covers had been published for some time prior to the beginning of the Winston series, most notably the Tom Swift series published from 1910 to 1941. However, as the Tom Swift series declined, and the economic pressures of World War II escalated, juvenile offerings became slim.The Winston Publishing Company had a history of publishing material for youth since the early part of the 20th century, such as the Young People's Library of Entertainment and Amusement and The Forward Series for Boys and Girls. After the publication of Robert A. Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo in 1947 revived the juvenile science fiction market, The Winston Publishing Company decided to develop a juvenile science fiction series that would be set apart from the pulp fiction of its time. Known and respected SF authors were hired, and each novel was to include a factual foreword explaining the science and technology referenced in the novel. The publisher's announcement of the series in Publishers Weekly clearly outlines the goals of the series:\n\nFive compelling tales designed TO SELL to the expanding science fiction market! Only writers who have won the respect of the science fiction audience have been signed to write these accurate yet absorbing books. Each contains an explanation of new terms and a discussion of its scientific aspects. ... For all ages.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe series began in 1952 with the publication of the first 5 books: Earthbound by Milton Lesser, Find the Feathered Serpent by Evan Hunter, Marooned on Mars by Lester del Rey, Son of the Stars by Raymond Jones, and Five Against Venus by Philip Latham. Later in the year a second group of five novels were added to the series: Sons of the Ocean Deeps by Bryce Walton, Mists of Dawn by Chad Oliver, Rocket Jockey by Phillip St. John, Islands in the Sky by Arthur Clarke, and Vault of the Ages by Poul Anderson. Each book was an original written especially for the Winston series, and marketed for the juvenile audience.\n\n\n== Literary significance and reception ==\nDiffering from static characters like Tom Swift and the Lucky Starr series the Winston heroes show dynamic growth and character development throughout their novels and series. This fact has contributed to the lasting influence of the series on its readers, creating accessible role models for young readers.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\n\nThe first edition dust jacket illustrations by famous science fiction artists have made the Winston set highly collectible. Contributors include Hugo winning artists like Alex Schomburg (who also created the endpapers used in every book of the series) and Virgil Finlay, as well Hugo nominees like Mel Hunter, and Ed Emshwiller. There is even a cover (\"The Ant Men\") by Paul Blaisdell, best known for his imaginatively extreme monsters in low-budget science fiction movies of the 1950s, such as \"It Conquered the World\"\nWinston cover art features colorful images of spaceflight, exploration (of Earth, Space, and Time) and other fantastical subject matter describing important scenes from each book. The art is similar in style to pulp fiction art of the time, but like the novels themselves, the art tends towards a believable and accurate portrayal of the subject matter. Artists like Mel Hunter had extensive training in scientific and technical illustration, and a broad knowledge of space technologies. This gives the covers a more serious feel than some other art of the time, and compliments the educational attitude the authors took in writing their factual forewords describing the science and technology that appears in the books.\n\n\n== Books ==\nThe series was not numbered.

    "Nabuma Rubberband": "Nabuma Rubberband is the fourth studio album by Swedish electronic music band Little Dragon, released on 9 May 2014 by Because Music. It features collaborations with Dave from De La Soul and Robin Hannibal. The album spawned three singles: \"Klapp Klapp\", \"Paris\" and \"Let Go\". Nabuma Rubberband was nominated for Best Dance/Electronic Album at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Background ==\nLittle Dragon started working on their fourth studio album in early 2013 in their hometown of Gothenburg, Sweden, after extensively touring in support of their 2011 album Ritual Union. \"I think when we started we had no vision whatsoever\", singer Yukimi Nagano said. \"We just wanted to make the ball start rolling and just brainstorm ideas and see what comes up and then make plans thereafter. I think a lot of visions came through. Our sound is wide\u2014it's not just one particular style\u2014so we dove into different worlds. New worlds, new spaces we haven't been to before. There definitely are elements of sonically romantic tracks. It feels like there are different moods and we're exploring ourselves a bit.\" By October 2013, the band had finished most of the work on the album.String players from the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra are featured on a few songs from the album, marking the first time Little Dragon have collaborated with outside musicians. \"It's nice to see your music reflected on another musician\", drummer Erik Bodin said. \"Especially when they come from the outside and you can see how they interpret it. It's an honor.\" Other collaborators include Dave of De La Soul, who co-wrote the songs \"Mirror\" and \"Killing Me\", and Robin Hannibal, who co-produced \"Killing Me\" and \"Let Go\".Nagano cited Janet Jackson as an influence on Nabuma Rubberband, particularly her song \"Any Time, Any Place\" (1993). \"When you put some of Janet's really slow stuff on you feel like you're floating\", Nagano said. \"That feeling really influenced me and maybe that's why there are quite a lot of slow jams on the record. In the past we've been a bit self-conscious about making slow jams after 'Twice.' Then we wanted to make dance music which we did with Machine Dreams and then Ritual Union still had a dance vibe, but with this album it wasn't about that. The intention was about whatever we felt strongly about.\"\n\n\n== Promotion and release ==\n\nThe album's title was revealed to be Nabuma Rubberband on 28 January 2014, when a 28-second trailer for the album containing the title track premiered online. According to Nagano, Nabuma is a river in the Congo, as well as the name of the sister of Ugandan reggae artist Madoxx, with whom the other three members of Little Dragon toured in Uganda around 2003, while performing as a reggae group. Her name came up while the band were working on the beat for the album's title track, on which Nagano sings about being \"blinded by a rubberband\". \"We have a track on the album called 'Nabuma Rubberband' and on the cover there's a picture of a girl jumping so I liked the idea of it being her name. It seems quite awkward to have a little Chinese girl with a Ugandan name and Rubberband as a last name\", Nagano added.The cover art, release date and track listing were unveiled on 13 February 2014. Following the album's announcement, Little Dragon played a six-date European tour from 20 February to 5 March, including shows in Amsterdam, Hamburg, Berlin, London, Stockholm and Paris. On 27 March 2014, the band announced a North American spring tour, which kicked off at the Soul'd Out Music Festival in Portland, Oregon, on 10 April. Additional dates in Europe, North America and Japan were announced on 27 May, beginning at the We Love Green festival in Paris on 31 May, and wrapping up the tour with a string of eight shows across the United Kingdom in November. On 9 May 2014, the album was exclusively streamed on The Guardian's website.A remix version of the album by OG Ron C and DJ Candlestick of The Chopstars, titled Nabuma Purple Rubberband, was made available for download and streaming via Adult Swim's website on 27 January 2015. \"Pink Cloud\" was released on 18 April 2015 as a limited-edition pink marbled 12-inch vinyl for Record Store Day.\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Klapp Klapp\" was released on 14 February 2014 as the album's lead single. The accompanying music video was directed by Taylor Cohen and debuted on the same day. On 19 February, Little Dragon performed \"Klapp Klapp\" on Late Show with David Letterman. The band also performed the single on Later... with Jools Holland on 6 May.The album's second single, \"Paris\", was released on 10 April 2014, followed by its Trevor Kane-directed video, which premiered on 2 May. Little Dragon performed \"Paris\" on The Queen Latifah Show on 23 April, and on 22 May, the band performed \"Klapp Klapp\" and \"Killing Me\" on Jimmy Kimmel Live! \"Let Go\" was released on 22 April 2014 as the third single from the album.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nNabuma Rubberband received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 77, based on 21 reviews. Will Salmon of Clash wrote that \"[t]he production is shimmering and spacious, Yukimi Nagano's vocals the centre of a cat's cradle of glittering synths and down-tempo beats.\" He added that the album is \"altogether more assured\" and \"match[es] the brilliance\" of the band's live sets\". Regarding the contributions from Dave of De La Soul and Robin Hannibal (\"Mirror\", \"Killing Me\" and \"Let Go\"), Andy Kellman of AllMusic stated, \"Subtract those contributions and [Nabuma Rubberband] would still be the group's most accomplished work.\" Nathan Stevens of PopMatters expressed that \"Nagano has plenty of stunning moments on Nabuma Rubberband, but it's clear this is a full band enterprise\", noting that \"[t]he dynamic chemistry between [Fredrik K\u00e4llgren Wallin and Erik Bodin] drives a majority of these songs along.\" Huw Oliver of DIY commented that on Nabuma Rubberband, the band's \"drum-and-synths minimalism is more refined, the bass-lines more prominent, the hooks almost embarrassingly memorable\", and that Nagano's \"effortless vocal is staggering.\" Slant Magazine's Kevin Liedel opined that \"Nabuma Rubberband's triumph doesn't stem merely from its creators' newfound confidence. Rather, the album often serves as a paradigm of expertly managed complexity, each track balancing dozens of moving parts and teeming with melodic percolation.\"John Murphy of musicOMH concluded, \"While Nabuma Rubberband may not be the commercial breakthrough that some may have expected, it's still a largely enjoyable record and, together with fellow Swede Lykke Li's new album, proves once again that nobody does swooningly melancholic pop quite like the Scandanavians [sic].\" Alex Denney of NME felt that the album \"isn't quite the home run it should have been, chiefly because the songwriting can't always keep pace with the band's vaulting ambition\", but wrote that \"when they get it right\u2014'Let Go' is precisely the sort of arthouse R&B blockbuster they could've done with more of\u2014they flirt with perfection.\" Zander Porter of Consequence of Sound described Nabuma Rubberband as \"Little Dragon's selfish record, and splendidly so. Some of the sweet moments in its strongest tracks, however, are lost in others, as is the nature of an album with standout tracks. Even yet, Little Dragon ended Nabuma on a note of tastefulness that shows their confidence has been a positive development.\" Pitchfork's Harley Brown found that the album's \"slow jams are perfectly sexy, but they lack originality\", while remarking, \"It's great the band was able to find a throughline between the comfortable and the experimental this time around, but on Nabuma Rubberband they let go of a little too much of themselves in the process.\" Uncut's Sam Richards commented that \"the likes of 'Mirror' and 'Paris' are melodically and emotionally direct but with plenty going on beneath the surface, while the restrained tempos serve to show off Nagano's nicely maturing voice.\" Richards continued, \"There's nothing here that is likely to offend or amaze but it's a classy affair from start to finish.\" Kitty Empire of The Observer viewed the album as \"another fine entry into [the band's] parallel universe\", but felt that \"[i]t's not the break-out record that they might have gone for\".\n\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nNabuma Rubberband debuted at number 14 on the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 4,203 copies, becoming Little Dragon's highest-peaking album on the chart to date.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll tracks are written by Little Dragon, except where noted.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Nabuma Rubberband.\nLittle Dragon \u2013 production\nRobin Hannibal \u2013 production on \"Killing Me\" and \"Let Go\"\nJaycen Joshua \u2013 mixing\nRyan Kaul \u2013 mixing assistance\nDave Kutch \u2013 mastering\nLi Wei \u2013 cover image\nMatt de Jong \u2013 design\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Release history ==\n\n\n== References ==",
    "St Leonard's Priory, London": "St Leonard's Priory was a Benedictine nunnery in what is now east London, which gave its name to Bromley-St Leonards (better known as Bromley-by-Bow.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIt was first recorded in 1122 as an institution for nine nuns and a prioress - around the time of its Dissolution the priory's own tradition was that it had been founded by Maurice or Richard de Belmeis I, though the antiquarian John Leland believed it had been a co-foundation by William of London and William Roscelin. It was the burial place of some of the Earls of Hereford and of Essex as well as of a daughter of William, Earl of Henault.\nInitially held by Geoffrey, Earl of Essex, the lands on which the priory stood had shifted to the prior and canons of Holy Trinity Priory, Aldgate by 1292. It achieved notoriety in the Geoffrey Chaucer's description of the Nun Prioress in the General Prologue to his Canterbury Tales:\n\nThis was a barbed reference as it implied the Prioress had learned French from the Benedictine nuns in a distinct Anglo-Norman dialect. By this time the dialect had lost prestige and was being ridiculed as sub-standard French.\n\n\n=== Dissolution and after ===\n\nThe priory was destroyed during the first phase of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, along with many other smaller religious house. Its books were moved to Westminster Abbey to join the library for the new Diocese of Westminster and the church retained to form a new parish church. Sybil Kirke was the last prioress \u2013 she was granted an annual pension of \u00a315 and allowed to retain 35 shillings 2 pence worth of Priory goods. Initially she was also granted the retention of some of the priory's demesne lands to cover her household expenses. She lived until at least 1553.Most of the rest of the building's contents (such as its cattle and corn) were sold by the king's commissioners to Sir Ralph Sadleir, who lived at Sutton House in Homerton and was privy councillor to Henry VIII. Some were also sold to Mr More, steward to the Lord Chancellor. In February 1539 the crown also granted Sadleir the priory's site, buildings and most of its lands, including the manor of Bromley, though initially these had all been sold to William Rolte. All that remains of the grounds of the Abbey is the parish church's small neglected churchyard.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Himachal Pradesh": "Himachal Pradesh (; Hindi: [\u0266\u026a\u02c8m\u0251\u02d0t\u0283\u0259l p\u027e\u0259\u02c8d\u032ae\u02d0\u0283] (listen); lit. \"Province of the Snow-laden Mountains\") is a state in the northern part of India. Situated in the Western Himalayas, it is one of the eleven mountain states and is characterized by an extreme landscape featuring several peaks and extensive river systems. Himachal Pradesh is the northernmost state of India and shares borders with the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the north, and the states of Punjab to the west, Haryana to the southwest, Uttarakhand to the southeast and a very narrow border with Uttar Pradesh to the South. The state also shares an international border to the east with the Tibet Autonomous Region in China. Himachal Pradesh is also known as  'Dev Bhoomi' or 'Land of God' and 'Veer Bhoomi' which means 'Land of Braves'.The predominantly mountainous region comprising the present-day Himachal Pradesh has been inhabited since pre-historic times having witnessed multiple waves of human migrations from other areas. Through its history, the region was mostly ruled by local kingdoms some of which accepted the suzerainty of larger empires. Prior to India's independence from the British, Himachal comprised the hilly regions of Punjab Province of British India. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organized as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh which later became a union territory. In 1966, hilly areas of neighboring Punjab state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.\nHimachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. Around 90% of the state's population lives in rural areas. Agriculture, horticulture, hydropower and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy. The hilly state is almost universally electrified with 99.5% of the households having electricity as of 2016. The state was declared India's second open-defecation-free state in 2016. According to a survey of CMS \u2013 India Corruption Study 2017, Himachal Pradesh is India's least corrupt state.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTribes such as the Koli, Hali, Dagi, Dhaugri, Dasa, Khasa, Kanaura, and Kirata inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. The foothills of the modern state of Himachal Pradesh were inhabited by people from the Indus valley civilisation which flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. The Kols and Mundas are believed to be the original inhabitants to the hills of present-day Himachal Pradesh followed by the Bhotas and Kiratas.During the Vedic period, several small republics known as Janapada existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajputs principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 11th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles. Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.The Kingdom of Gorkha conquered many kingdoms and came to power in Nepal in 1768. They consolidated their military power and began to expand their territory. Gradually, the Kingdom of Nepal annexed Sirmour and Shimla. Under the leadership of Amar Singh Thapa, the Nepali army laid siege to Kangra. They managed to defeat Sansar Chand Katoch, the ruler of Kangra, in 1806 with the help of many provincial chiefs. However, the Nepali army could not capture Kangra fort which came under Maharaja Ranjeet Singh in 1809. After the defeat, they expanded towards the south of the state. However, Raja Ram Singh, Raja of Siba State, captured the fort of Siba from the remnants of Lahore Darbar in Samvat 1846, during the First Anglo-Sikh War.\nThey came into direct conflict with the British along the tarai belt after which the British expelled them from the provinces of the Satluj. The British gradually emerged as the paramount power in the region. In the revolt of 1857, or first Indian war of independence, arising from a number of grievances against the British, the people of the hill states were not as politically active as were those in other parts of the country. They and their rulers, with the exception of Bushahr, remained more or less inactive. Some, including the rulers of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal and Dhami, rendered help to the British government during the revolt.\n\nThe British territories came under the British Crown after Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858. The states of Chamba, Mandi and Bilaspur made good progress in many fields during the British rule. During World War I, virtually all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and contributed to the British war effort, both in the form of men and materials. Among these were the states of Kangra, Jaswan, Datarpur, Guler, Rajgarh, Nurpur, Chamba, Suket, Mandi, and Bilaspur.After independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh was organised on 15 April 1948 as a result of the integration of 28 petty princely states (including feudal princes and zaildars) in the promontories of the western Himalayas. These were known as the Simla Hills States and four Punjab southern hill states under the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged into Himachal Pradesh on 1 July 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954.Himachal became a Part 'C' state on 26 January 1950 when Constitution of India came into effect and the Lieutenant Governor was appointed. The Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a union territory on 1 November 1956. Some areas of Punjab State, namely, Simla, Kangra, Kullu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Lohara, Amb and Una Kanungo circles, some area of Santokhgarh Kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una Tehsil of Hoshiarpur District, as well as Kandaghat and Nalagarh Tehsils of earstwhile PEPSU State, besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Kanungo circle of Pathankot District\u2014were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on enactment by Parliament of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966. On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament, and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Himachal became the 18th state of the Indian Union with Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar as its first chief minister.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nHimachal is in the western Himalayas situated  between  30\u00b022\u2032N and  33\u00b012\u2032N  latitude  and  75\u00b047\u2032E \u0301 and  79\u00b004\u2032E  longitude. Covering an area of 55,673 square kilometres (21,495 sq mi), it is a mountainous state. The Zanskar range runs in the northeastern part of the state and the great Himalayan range run through the eastern and northern parts, while the Dhauladhar and the Pir Panjal ranges of the lesser Himalayas, and their valleys, form much of the core regions. The outer Himalayas, or the Shiwalik range, form southern and western Himachal Pradesh. At 6,816 m, Reo Purgyil is the highest mountain peak in the state of Himachal Pradesh.The drainage system of Himachal is composed both of rivers and glaciers. Himalayan rivers criss-cross the entire mountain chain.\nHimachal Pradesh provides water to both the Indus and Ganges basins. The drainage systems of the region are the Chandra Bhaga or the Chenab, the Ravi, the Beas, the Sutlej, and the Yamuna. These rivers are perennial and are fed by snow and rainfall. They are protected by an extensive cover of natural vegetation. Four of the five Punjab rivers flow through the state, three of them originating here.\nDue to extreme variation in elevation, great variation occurs in the climatic conditions of Himachal. The climate varies from hot and humid subtropical in the southern tracts to, with more elevation, cold, alpine, and glacial in the northern and eastern mountain ranges. The state's winter capital, Dharamsala receives very heavy rainfall, while areas like Lahaul and Spiti are cold and almost rainless. Broadly, Himachal experiences three seasons: summer, winter, and rainy season. Summer lasts from mid-April till the end of June and most parts become very hot (except in the alpine zone which experiences a mild summer) with the average temperature ranging from 28 to 32 \u00b0C (82 to 90 \u00b0F). Winter lasts from late November till mid-March. Snowfall is common in alpine tracts.\nThe pollution is affecting the climate of almost all the states of India. There are many steps taken by governments to prevent pollution. In relation to this, Ujjwala Yojana and Grihni Suvidha Scheme were launched and as a result Himachal Pradesh has become the first smoke free state in India which means the cooking in entire state is free of traditional chulhas.\n\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n\nHimachal Pradesh is one of the states that lies in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), one of the richest reservoirs of biological diversity in the world. As of 2002, the IHR is undergoing large scale irrational extraction of wild, medicinal herbs, thus endangering many of its high-value gene stock. To address this, a workshop on \u2018Endangered Medicinal Plant Species in Himachal Pradesh\u2019 was held in 2002 and the conference was attended by forty experts from diverse disciplines.\n\nAccording to 2003 Forest Survey of India report, legally defined forest areas constitute 66.52% of the area of Himachal Pradesh. Vegetation in the state is dictated by elevation and precipitation. The state is endowed with a high diversity of medicinal and aromatic plants. Lahaul-Spiti region of the state, being a cold desert, supports unique plants of medicinal value including Ferula jaeschkeana, Hyoscyamus niger, Lancea tibetica, and Saussurea bracteata.Himachal is also said to be the fruit bowl of the country, with orchards being widespread. Meadows and pastures are also seen clinging to steep slopes. After the winter season, the hillsides and orchards bloom with wild flowers, while gladiolas, carnations, marigolds, roses, chrysanthemums, tulips and lilies are carefully cultivated. Himachal Pradesh Horticultural Produce Marketing and Processing Corporation Ltd. (HPMC) is a state body that markets fresh and processed fruits.\nHimachal Pradesh has around 463 bird, and Tragopan melanocephalus is the state bird of Himanchal Pradesh 77 mammalian, 44 reptile and 80 fish species.Himachal Pradesh has currently five National Parks.  Great Himalayan National Park, oldest and largest National park in the state, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Pin Valley National Park, Inderkilla, Khirganga and Simbalbara are the other national Parks located in the state. The state also has 30 wildlife sanctuaries and 3 conservation reserves. The state bird of Himachal Pradesh is the Western tragopan, locally known as the jujurana. It is one of the rarest living pheasants in the world. The state animal is the Snow leopard, which is even rarer to find than the jujurana.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\nThe Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh has no pre-constitution history. The State itself is a post-independence creation. It came into being as a centrally administered territory on 15 April 1948 from the integration of thirty erstwhile princely states.Himachal Pradesh is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy, a feature the state shares with other Indian states. Universal suffrage is granted to residents. The legislature consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The judiciary is composed of the Himachal Pradesh High Court and a system of lower courts.\n\nExecutive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister, although the titular head of government is the Governor. The governor is the head of state appointed by the President of India. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is unicameral with 68 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA). Terms of office run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.\nIn the assembly elections held in November 2017, the Bharatiya Janata Party secured an absolute majority, winning 44 of the 68 seats while the Congress won only 21 of the 68 seats. Jai Ram Thakur was sworn in as Himachal Pradesh's Chief Minister for the first time in Shimla on 27 December 2017.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe state of Himachal Pradesh is divided into 12 districts which are grouped into three divisions, Shimla, Kangra and Mandi. The districts are further divided into 73 subdivisions, 78 blocks and 172 Tehsils.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe era of planning in Himachal Pradesh started in 1951 along with the rest of India with the implementation of the first five-year plan. The First Plan allocated \u20b952.7 million to Himachal Pradesh. More than 50% of this expenditure was incurred on transport and communication; while the power sector got a share of just 4.6%, though it had steadily increased to 7% by the Third Plan. Expenditure on agriculture and allied activities increased from 14.4% in the First Plan to 32% in the Third Plan, showing a progressive decline afterwards from 24% in the Fourth Plan to less than 10% in the Tenth Plan. Expenditure on energy sector was 24.2% of the total in the Tenth Plan.\n\nThe total GDP for 2005\u201306 was estimated at \u20b9254 billion as against \u20b9230 billion in the year 2004\u201305, showing an increase of 10.5%. The GDP for fiscal 2015\u201316 was estimated at \u20b91.110 trillion, which increased to \u20b91.247 trillion in 2016\u201317, recording growth of 6.8%. The per capita income increased from \u20b9130,067 in 2015\u201316 to \u20b9147,277 in 2016\u201317. The state government's advance estimates for fiscal 2017\u201318 stated the total GDP and per capita income as \u20b91.359 trillion and \u20b9158,462, respectively. As of 2018, Himachal is the 22nd-largest state economy in India with \u20b91.52 lakh crore (US$20 billion) in gross domestic product and has the 13th-highest per capita income (\u20b9160,000 (US$2,100)) among the states and union territories of India.Himachal Pradesh also ranks as the second-best performing state in the country on human development indicators after Kerala. One of the Indian government's key initiatives to tackle unemployment is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA). The participation of women in the NREGA has been observed to vary across different regions of the nation. As of the year 2009\u20132010, Himachal Pradesh joined the category of high female participation, recording a 46% share of NREGS (National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme) work days to women. This was a drastic increase from the 13% that was recorded in 2006\u20132007.\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nAgriculture accounts for 9.4% of the net state domestic product. It is the main source of income and employment in Himachal. About 90% of the population in Himachal depends directly upon agriculture, which provides direct employment to 62% of total workers of state. The main cereals grown include wheat, maize, rice and barley with major cropping systems being maize-wheat, rice-wheat and maize-potato-wheat. Pulses, fruits, vegetables and oilseeds are among the other crops grown in the state. Centuries-old traditional Kuhl irrigation system is prevalent in the Kangra valley, though in recent years these Kuhls have come under threat from hydroprojects on small streams in the valley. Land husbandry initiatives such as the Mid-Himalayan Watershed Development Project, which includes the Himachal Pradesh Reforestation Project (HPRP), the world's largest clean development mechanism (CDM) undertaking, have improved agricultural yields and productivity, and raised rural household incomes.\n\nApple is the principal cash crop of the state grown principally in the districts of Shimla, Kinnaur, Kullu, Mandi, Chamba and some parts of Sirmaur and Lahaul-Spiti with an average annual production of five lakh tonnes and per hectare production of 8 to 10 tonnes. The apple cultivation constitute 49 per cent of the total area under fruit crops and 85% of total fruit production in the state with an estimated economy of \u20b93500 crore. Apples from Himachal are exported to other Indian states and even other countries. In 2011\u201312, the total area under apple cultivation was 104,000 hectares, increased from 90,347 hectares in 2000\u201301. According to the provisional estimates of Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, the annual apple production in Himachal for fiscal 2015\u201316 stood at 753,000 tonnes, making it India's second-largest apple-producing state after Jammu and Kashmir. The state is also among the leading producers of other fruits such as apricots, cherries, peaches, pears, plums and strawberries in India.\nKangra tea is grown in the Kangra valley. Tea plantation began in 1849, and production peaked in the late 19th century with the tea becoming popular across the globe. Production dipped sharply after the 1905 Kangra earthquake and continues to decline. The tea received geographical indication status in 2005.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nHydropower is one of the major sources of income generation for the state. The state has an abundance of hydropower resources because of the presence of various perennial rivers. Many high-capacity hydropower plants have been constructed which produce surplus electricity that is sold to other states, such as Delhi, Punjab and West Bengal. The income generated from exporting the electricity to other states is being provided as subsidy to the consumers in the state. The rich hydropower resources of Himachal have resulted in the state becoming almost universally electrified with around 94.8% houses receiving electricity as of 2001, as compared to the national average of 55.9%. Himachal's hydro-electric power production is however yet to be fully utilised. The identified hydroelectric potential for the state is 27,436 MW in five river basins while the hydroelectric capacity in 2016 was 10,351 MW.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nTourism in Himachal Pradesh is a major contributor to the state's economy and growth. The Himalayas attracts tourists from all over the world. Hill stations like Shimla, Manali, Dharamshala, Dalhousie, Chamba, Khajjiar, Kullu and Kasauli are popular destinations for both domestic and foreign tourists. The state also has many important Hindu pilgrimage sites with prominent temples like Shri Chamunda Devi Mandir, Naina Devi Temple, Bajreshwari Mata Temple, Jwala Ji Temple, Chintpurni, Baijnath Temple, Bhimakali Temple, Bijli Mahadev and Jakhoo Temple. Manimahesh Lake situated in the Bharmour region of Chamba district is the venue of an annual Hindu pilgrimage trek held in the month of August which attracts lakhs of devotees. The state is also referred to as \"Dev Bhoomi\" (literally meaning Abode of Gods) due to its mention as such in ancient Hindu texts and occurrence of a large number of historical temples in the state.\n\nHimachal is also known for its adventure tourism activities like ice skating in Shimla, paragliding in Bir Billing and Solang valley, rafting in Kullu, skiing in Manali, boating in Bilaspur and trekking, horse riding and fishing in different parts in the state. Shimla, the state's capital, is home to Asia's only natural ice-skating rink. Spiti Valley in Lahaul and Spiti District situated at an altitude of over 3000 metres with its picturesque landscapes is an important destination for adventure seekers. The region also has some of the oldest Buddhist Monasteries in the world\n\nHimachal hosted the first Paragliding World Cup in India from 24 to 31 October in 2015. The venue for the paragliding world cup was Bir Billing, which is 70 km from the tourist town Macleod Ganj, located in the heart of Himachal in Kangra District. Bir Billing is the centre for aero sports in Himachal and considered as best for paragliding. Buddhist monasteries, trekking to tribal villages and mountain biking are other local possibilities.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHimachal has three Domestic Airports in Kangra, Kullu and Shimla districts. The air routes connect the state with Delhi and Chandigarh.\n\nBhuntar Airport is in Kullu district, around 10 kilometres (6 mi) from district headquarters.\nGaggal Airport is in Kangra district, around 15 kilometres (9 mi) from district headquarters at Dharamshala, which is around 10 kilometres from Kangra\nShimla Airport is around 21 kilometres (13 mi) west of the city.\n\n\n=== Railways ===\n\n\n==== Broad-gauge lines ====\nThe only broad-gauge railway line in the whole state connects Amb Andaura\u2013Una Himachal railway station to Nangal Dam in Punjab and runs all the way to Daulatpur, Himachal Pradesh. It is an electrified track since 1999.\nFuture constructions:\n\nUna Himachal\u2013Hamirpur rail project via Dhundla\nBhanupali (Punjab)\u2013Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh\nChandigarh\u2013Baddi\n\n\n==== Narrow-gauge lines ====\nHimachal is known for its narrow-gauge railways. One is the Kalka-Shimla Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and another is the Kangra Valley Railway. The total length of these two tracks is 259 kilometres (161 mi). The Kalka-Shimla Railway passes through many tunnels and Bridgies, while the Pathankot\u2013Jogindernagar meanders through a maze of hills and valleys. The total route length of the operational railway network in the state is 296.26 kilometres (184.09 mi).\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nRoads are the major mode of transport in the hilly terrains. The state has road network of 28,208 kilometres (17,528 mi), including eight National Highways (NH) that constitute 1,234 kilometres (767 mi) and 19 State Highways with a total length of 1,625 kilometres (1,010 mi). Hamirpur district has the highest road density in the country. Some roads are closed during winter and monsoon seasons due to snow and landslides. The state-owned Himachal Road Transport Corporation with a fleet of over 3,100, operates bus services connecting important cities and towns with villages within the state and also on various interstate routes. In addition, around 5,000 private buses ply in the state.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nHimachal Pradesh has a total population of 6,864,602 including 3,481,873 males and 3,382,729 females according to the Census of India 2011.

The scheduled castes and scheduled tribes account for 25.19 per cent and 5.71 per cent of the population, respectively. The sex ratio stood at 972 females per 1,000 males, recording a marginal increase from 968 in 2001. The child sex ratio increased from 896 in 2001 to 909 in 2011. The total fertility rate (TFR) per woman in 2015 stood at 1.7, one of the lowest in India.\n\nIn the census, the state is placed 21st on the population chart, followed by Tripura at 22nd place. Kangra District was top-ranked with a population strength of 1,507,223 (21.98%), Mandi District 999,518 (14.58%), Shimla District 813,384 (11.86%), Solan District 576,670 (8.41%), Sirmaur District 530,164 (7.73%), Una District 521,057 (7.60%), Chamba District 518,844 (7.57%), Hamirpur district 454,293 (6.63%), Kullu District 437,474 (6.38%), Bilaspur district 382,056 (5.57%), Kinnaur District 84,298 (1.23%) and Lahaul Spiti 31,528 (0.46%).The life expectancy at birth in Himachal Pradesh increased significantly from 52.6 years in the period from 1970 to 1975 (above the national average of 49.7 years) to 72.0 years for the period 2011\u201315 (above the national average of 68.3 years). The infant mortality rate stood at 40 in 2010, and the crude birth rate has declined from 37.3 in 1971 to 16.9 in 2010, below the national average of 26.5 in 1998. The crude death rate was 6.9 in 2010. Himachal Pradesh's literacy rate has almost doubled between 1981 and 2011 (see table to right). The state is one of the most literate states of India with a literacy rate of 83.78% as of 2011.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nHindi is the official language of Himachal Pradesh and is spoken by the majority of the population as a lingua franca. Sanskrit is the additional official language of the state, though it is largely restricted to educational and symbolic use..\nMost of the population, however, speak natively one or another of the Western Pahari languages (locally also known as Himachali or just Pahari), a subgroup of the Indo-Aryan languages that includes Bhattiyali, Bilaspuri, Chambeali, Churahi, Gaddi, Hinduri, Kangri, Kullu, Mahasu Pahari, Mandeali, Pahari Kinnauri, Pangwali, and Sirmauri.

With remarkable economic and social advancements, the state has changed rapidly. Himachal Pradesh is a multilingual state like other Indian states. Western Pahari languages also known as Himachali languages are widely spoken in the state. Some of the most commonly spoken individual languages are Kangri, Mandeali, Kulvi, Chambeali, Bharmauri and Kinnauri.\n\nThe Hindu communities residing in Himachal include the Brahmins, Kayasthas, Rajputs, Sunars, Kannets, Rathis and Kolis. The tribal population of the state consists mainly of Gaddis, Gujjars, Kanauras, Pangwalas, Bhots, Swanglas and Lahaulas.Himachal is well known for its handicrafts. The carpets, leather works, Kullu shawls, Kangra paintings, Chamba Rumals, stoles, embroidered grass footwear (Pullan chappal), silver jewellery, metal ware, knitted woolen socks, Pattoo, basketry of cane and bamboo (Wicker and Rattan) and woodwork are among the notable ones. Of late, the demand for these handicrafts has increased within and outside the country.\n\nHimachali caps of various colour bands are also well-known local art work, and are often treated as a symbol of the Himachali identity. The colour of the Himachali caps has been an indicator of political loyalties in the hill state for a long period of time with Congress party leaders like Virbhadra Singh donning caps with green band and the rival BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal wearing a cap with maroon band. The former has served six terms as the Chief Minister of the state while the latter is a two-time Chief Minister. Local music and dance also reflects the cultural identity of the state. Through their dance and music, the Himachali people entreat their gods during local festivals and other special occasions.\n\nApart from national fairs and festivals, there are regional fairs and festivals, including the temple fairs in nearly every region that are of great significance to Himachal Pradesh. The Kullu Dussehra festival is nationally known. The day-to-day cuisine of Himachalis is similar to the rest of northern India with Punjabi and Tibetan influences. Lentils (D\u0101l), rice (Ch\u0101wal or Bh\u0101\u021b), vegetables (Sabz\u012b) and chapati (wheat flatbread) form the staple food of the local population. Non-vegetarian food is more preferred and accepted in Himachal Pradesh than elsewhere in India, partly due to the scarcity of fresh vegetables on the hilly terrain of the state. Himachali specialities include Siddu, Babru, Khatta, Mhanee, Channa Madra, Patrode, Mah Ki Dal, Chamba-Style Fried Fish, Kullu Trout, Chha Gosht, Pahadi Chicken, Sepu Badi, Auriya Kaddu, Aloo Palda, Pateer, Makki Ki Roti and Sarson Ka Saag, Chouck, Bhagjery and Chutney of Til.\n\n\n=== Notable people ===\n\nVirbhadra Singh\nJP Nadda\nPrem Kumar Dhumal\nJai Ram Thakur\nAnurag Thakur\nKangana Ranaut\nYami Gautam\nRandeep Guleria\nVikram Batra\nRubina Dilaik\nPreity Zinta\nJay Chaudhry\nAnupam Kher\nGaurav Sharma (politician)\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nAt the time of Independence, Himachal Pradesh had a literacy rate of 8% \u2013 one of the lowest in the country. By 2011, the literacy rate surged to 82.8%, making Himachal one of the most-literate states in the country. There are over 10,000 primary schools, 1,000 secondary schools and more than 1,300 high schools in the state. In meeting the constitutional obligation to make primary education compulsory, Himachal became the first state in India to make elementary education accessible to every child. Himachal Pradesh is an exception to the nationwide gender bias in education levels. The state has a female literacy rate of around 76%. In addition, school enrolment and participation rates for girls are almost universal at the primary level. While higher levels of education do reflect a gender-based disparity, Himachal is still significantly ahead of other states at bridging the gap. The Hamirpur District in particular stands out for high literacy rates across all metrics of measurement.The state government has played an instrumental role in the rise of literacy in the state by spending a significant proportion of the state's GDP on education. During the first six five-year plans, most of the development expenditure in education sector was utilised in quantitative expansion, but after the seventh five-year-plan the state government switched emphasis on qualitative improvement and modernisation of education. In an effort to raise the number of teaching staff at primary schools they appointed over 1000 teacher aids through the Vidya Upasak Yojna in 2001. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is another HP government initiative that not only aims for universal elementary education but also encourages communities to engage in the management of schools. The Rashtriya Madhayamic Shiksha Abhiyan launched in 2009, is a similar scheme but focuses on improving access to quality secondary education.\n\nThe standard of education in the state has reached a considerably high level as compared to other states in India with several reputed educational institutes for higher studies. The Baddi University of Emerging Sciences and Technologies, Indian Institute of Technology Mandi, Indian Institute of Management Sirmaur, Himachal Pradesh University in Shimla, Central University of Himachal Pradesh, Dharamsala, National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, Indian Institute of Information Technology Una, Alakh Prakash Goyal University, Maharaja Agrasen University, Himachal Pradesh National Law University are some of the notable universities in the state. Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital in Shimla, Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Kangra, Rajiv Gandhi Government Post Graduate Ayurvedic College in Paprola and Homoeopathic Medical College & Hospital in Kumarhatti are the prominent medical institutes in the state. Besides these, there is a Government Dental College in Shimla which is the state's first recognised dental institute.The state government has also decided to start three major nursing colleges to develop the healthcare system of the state. CSK Himachal Pradesh Krishi Vishwavidyalya Palampur is one of the most renowned hill agriculture institutes in the world. Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry has earned a unique distinction in India for imparting teaching, research and extension education in horticulture, forestry and allied disciplines. Further, state-run Jawaharlal Nehru Government Engineering College was inaugurated in 2006 at Sundernagar.\nHimachal Pradesh also hosts a campus of the fashion college, National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Kangra.\n\n\n== State profile ==\nSource: Department of Information and Public Relations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOutline of Himachal Pradesh\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGovernmentThe Official Site of Himachal Pradesh\nThe Official Tourism Site of Himachal Pradesh, India\nNGO in Himachal PradeshGeneral informationHimachal Pradesh at Curlie\n Geographic data related to Himachal Pradesh at OpenStreetMap",

    "Codman triangle": "Codman triangle (previously referred to as Codman's triangle) is the triangular area of new subperiosteal bone that is created when a lesion, often a tumour, raises the periosteum away from the bone.  A Codman triangle is not actually a full triangle.  Instead, it is often a pseudotriangle on radiographic findings, with ossification on the original bone and one additional side of the triangle, which forms a two sided triangle with one open side.  This two sided appearance is generated due to a tumor (or growth) that is growing at a rate which is faster than the periosteum can grow or expand, so instead of dimpling, the periosteum tears away and provides ossification on the second edge of the triangle. The advancing tumour displaces the perisosteum away from the bone medulla. The displaced and now lateral periosteum attempts to regenerate underlying bone. This describes a periosteal reaction.The main causes for this sign are osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, eumycetoma, and a subperiosteal abscess.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is a professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHorowitz was born in Jerusalem in 1936 and immigrated to Canada with his parents at the age of 2. His father Rabbi Aaron Horowitz, was a prominent member of the Jewish community and a key figure in founding Camp Massad in Canada. He grew up in Calgary, Winnipeg, and Montreal.Horowitz earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from United College. He earned his Master of Arts degree from McGill University in 1959, writing his thesis on Mosca and Mills: Ruling Class and Power Elite. He earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Harvard University in 1965, writing his thesis on Canadian Labor in Politics: The Trade Unions and the CCF-NDP, 1937\u201362, with Sam Beer as his advisor.Horowitz has specialized in labour theory, and most notably coined the appellation Red Tory in his application of Louis Hartz's fragment theory to Canadian political culture and ideological development, in his essay \"Conservatism, Liberalism and Socialism in Canada: An Interpretation\" (in the Canadian Journal of Political Science, 32, 2 (1966): 143\u201371). The use of this appellation differentiates traditional Canadian Toryism from the powerful classical liberal elements that began to emerge in the Conservative Party after the Second World War, but it has applications to conservative parties in other countries where \"Tory\" acceptance of state enterprises, the welfare state, and other institutions seen as expressions of national character conflicts with \"liberal\" or \"neoliberal\" rejection of state intervention in the economy.\nHorowitz was a member of the editorial board of Canadian Dimension in its early days, and a frequent contributor to that magazine.Horowitz teaches a class at the University of Toronto entitled The Spirit of Democratic Citizenship which revolves around general semantics, a non-Aristotelian educational discipline first theorized by Polish engineer Alfred Korzybski.

    "R. K. Shekhar": "Rajagopala Kulashekharan (21 June 1933 \u2013 30 September 1976) was an Indian music composer who worked mainly for Malayalam movies. He composed music for 52 films (23 in Malayalam with 127 songs), and was the music conductor for more than 100 films. He is the father of music composer A. R. Rahman.His debut song as a music director was \"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare\" (\"from cradle to grave\"), which was a big hit in Kerala. This was composed for the film Pazhassi Raja (1964).\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHe was born to Rajagopala Bhagavathar, a harikathai exponent born in Tamil Mudaliyar family in Tamil Nadu. His entry into film music was opened through his extraordinary performances on harmonium for Theatre Plays. He started his career in the film industry as an assistant to music director M. B. Sreenivasan. Later on he conducted and arranged music for famous Malayalam Music directors M.K. Arjunan and V. Dakshinamoorthy. He was so fascinated by the tunes created by these legends, that he would work very hard single-handedly to create the BGM of the songs they tuned to match its purity and standard, thus making the songs evergreen on par. Their association lasted till his death.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHis career as an independent music composer started with the 1964 film Pazhassi Raja, of which the philosophical song \"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare\" became a big hit. After his next work in Aisha, he turned back to arranging and conducting for other composers.\nAfter a gap of 7 years, he returned to music composing through the film Anaathashilpangal in 1971. Apart from arranging the hits like Ninmaniarayile and Neela Nishidhini C.I.D. Nazir 1971 for director P. Venu, he composed music for his next film Taxi Car in 1972. Then he went on to compose music for about 20 films. Due to the failure of these films in the box office, his songs went unnoticed and he lacked to get more opportunities for composing.

    "Catherine Thornber": "Catherine Maria Thornber (c. 1813 \u2013 15 May 1894) was the founder of a school for girls in Unley Park, South Australia.\n\n\n== History ==\nCatherine Maria Thornber n\u00e9e Rowland (c. 1813 \u2013 15 May 1894) was born in Rodd, Herefordshire. She and her husband Robert Thornber ( \u2013 28 December 1854), and their four children lived in Harpurhey, near Manchester, then emigrated to South Australia on the Superb, arriving in November 1840. They settled first at Port Adelaide, then Kensington, finally a house later known as \"Peliatt Villa\" in Mitcham. Also on the Superb were Mrs. Thornber's parents Jane (c. 1790\u20131867) and Charles Rowland (c. 1790\u20131881), and her sister Mary Ellen Rowland (c. 1824\u20131911). Charles lost a fortune in some speculations, but managed to stay in business, trading as Thornber and Rowland until at least 1876, perhaps with one of his sons-in-law.\nRobert Thornber, who was in business with his father-in-law, initially prospered, and in 1848 was able to donate an acre of land for St. Michael's Anglican Church, Mitcham, then suffered some severe financial setbacks, was declared insolvent and their home was put up for auction. He took a fatal dose of laudanum while suffering from delirium tremens. To make ends meet, Catherine started a school for girls in her home. \"Mrs. Thornber's School\", as it was popularly known, was successful and she was able to move to a larger house on 2 acres (0.81 ha) on Gover Street, Unley Park. Sometime before 1879 the street name was changed to Thornber Street.Her two older daughters assisted in the operation of the school. The youngest, Ellen Thornber (1851\u20131947), trained as a teacher, and assisted in running the Grote Street teacher training college, then in 1880 was appointed assistant head of the Advanced School for Girls. She left in 1886 to become partner in her mother's school and helped prepare students for Adelaide University's matriculation exams. Students at the school were predominantly daughters of the clergy and professional men, attracted by its high standards in the teaching of science and languages, and by its liberal teaching methods, influenced by Fr\u00f6bel and Montessori. The school building was enlarged with the addition of an upper storey.\nThornber died in 1894 and her eldest daughter, known as \"Miss Catherine\" and her two sisters ran the Unley Park School (as it had become known) at 37 Thornber Street until December 1906, when it was taken over by Caroline Jacob to become part of Tormore House School, and closed in 1911. Their home was at 39 Thornber Street.\n\n\n== Family ==\nCatherine Maria Thornber, n\u00e9e Rowland, (c. 1813 \u2013 15 May 1894) was married to Robert Thornber ( \u2013 28 December 1854). Their children included:\n\nCharles Rowland Thornber (9 June 1834 \u2013 14 October 1920) married Elizabeth Ann ?? (c. 1841\u20131916) with the Moonta Mining Company. He was one of the first to be enrolled at St Peter's College and was involved with Alexander Tolmer's gold escorts. He was postmaster and librarian at Moonta for 43 years, died in Western Australia.\nEdward Thornber ( \u2013 1 April 1905), also one of the first SPC students, worked as a commission agent, had a small farm of 2 acres (0.81 ha) on Unley Road and made some excellent wine; moved to Broken Hill, where he died.\nCatherine Maria Thornber (17 November 1837 \u2013 30 September 1924) ran the school after death of her mother. She was generally known as \"Miss Thornber\", and her mother, who had the same names, as \"Mrs. Thornber\". The Thornber University Scholarship was founded in her memory in 1925.\nRachel Thornber (3 March 1839 \u2013 4 February 1930), overshadowed by her sisters, managed the boarding house.\nRobert Henry Thornber (1847 \u2013  May 1930) married Mina Cook on 21 February 1873. He was with the Bank of South Australia, then the Union Bank of Australia, later at Young, New South Wales\nEllen Thornber (1851 \u2013 18 March 1947) was strong on education theory and practice; maintained the high academic standards of the school.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Common starfish": "The common starfish, common sea star or sugar starfish (Asterias rubens) is the most common and familiar starfish in the north-east Atlantic. Belonging to the family Asteriidae, it has five arms and usually grows to between 10\u201330 cm across, although larger specimens (up to 52 cm across) are known. The common starfish is usually orange or brownish in color, and sometimes violet; specimens found in deeper waters are pale. The common starfish is found on rocky and gravelly substrates where it feeds on mollusks and other benthic invertebrates.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe common starfish normally has five arms, broad at their base and gradually tapering to a point at their tips, which are often turned up slightly. There is a line of short white spines running along the centre of the aboral (upper) surface of the arms with low, soft mounds called papulae on either side. The oral (lower) surfaces of the arms have rows of small tube feet, used in locomotion and feeding. The starfish is usually orange or brick red on the aboral surface and paler on the oral surface but can also be purple or pale brown. Individuals from deep water are usually paler. It grows to a maximum diameter of about 52 centimetres (20 in) but a more normal size is 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 in).\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe common starfish is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and its range extends from Norway and Sweden, through the North Sea, round the coasts of Britain, France, Spain and Portugal and southwards along the coasts of Africa to Senegal. It is largely absent from the Mediterranean Sea. It is also known from the western Atlantic where it occurs between Labrador and Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. It is capable of surviving in brackish water.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe common starfish feeds on a variety of benthic organisms. These include bivalve molluscs, polychaete worms, barnacles, gastropod molluscs, other echinoderms and carrion. When feeding on a mollusc such as a mussel, it attaches its tube feet to each shell valve and exerts force to separate them slightly. Even a gap of just 1 mm (0.04 in) is sufficient for the starfish to insert a fold of its stomach, secrete enzymes and start digesting the mollusc body. When the contents are sufficiently liquid, it brings its stomach back to its rightful position with the food inside. The common starfish has a well-developed sense of smell and can detect the odour of prey species such as the common mussel (Mytilus edulis) and crawl towards it. It can also detect the odour of the predatory common sunstar (Crossaster papposus), which eats other starfish, and take evasive action.\n\nThe common starfish is dioecious, which means that each individual is either male or female. In the spring, the females release their eggs into the sea. A moderate sized starfish is estimated to be able to produce 2.5 million eggs. The males shed their sperm and fertilisation takes place in the water column. The larvae are planktonic and drift for about 87 days before settling on the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into juveniles. Common starfish are believed to live for about seven to eight years.  When well fed, the juveniles can increase their radius at the rate of slightly more than 10 mm (0.4 in) per month during the summer and autumn and slightly less than 5 millimetres (0.20 in) per month in the winter. An adult common starfish can survive starvation for several months although it loses weight in the process. One specimen shrank from a radius of 6 centimetres (2.4 in) to a radius of 3.8 centimetres (1.5 in) after starvation for five months.The ciliate protozoan Orchitophrya stellarum is sometimes a parasite of the common starfish.\nIt normally lives on the outer surface of the starfish feeding on sloughed-off epidermal tissue. It appears to become parasitic when the host starfish has ripe gonads and is a male. It enters the starfish through the gonopores, the orifices where gametes are released. There may be a pheromone that alerts it to the fact that the testes are ripe and causes it to change its behaviour. As different species of starfish breed at different times of year, Orchitophrya stellarum may move from one species to another in accordance with their reproductive cycles. In the Atlantic Ocean, it may alternate between parasitising Asterias forbesi and Asterias rubens during the spring and summer and the winter host may be Leptasterias spp.. The ciliate has been found in the testes of all these species. When inside the gonad, it phagocytoses the sperm thus rendering the starfish infertile. Researchers have found a change in the sex ratios of affected populations with fewer males than females being present with the males being consistently smaller than the females.The common starfish produces a saponin-like substance designed to repel predators, which causes a reaction in the common whelk (Buccinum undatum), a common prey species. At dilute concentrations it caused the whelk to take evasive action and at higher concentrations it produced a series of convulsions.\n\n\n== Mass strandings ==\n\nIn January 2013, large numbers of common starfish were washed up near Cleethorpes Pier on the east coast of England along with many razor shells. There were estimated to be four thousand starfish along the stretch of shore. The cause of this mass stranding was unknown but bad weather and storms out at sea coupled with higher than usual tides may have been to blame.During Storm Frank in the early hours of 31 December 2015 hundreds of starfish were stranded along the coast of Portsmouth, Hampshire.\nThis is not a unique phenomenon and other mass strandings have occurred in Britain and elsewhere at such places as near Sandwich in Kent in 2008, and near Brighton ten days later. A similar occurrence occurred on the shore of the White Sea where vast numbers of starfish came ashore on a nine-mile stretch of beach in 2004. It was said that people could not \"walk around them because the whole shore was full of starfish\". Russian experts expressed mystification as to the cause of the stranding.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAsterias amurensis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotos of Common starfish on Sealife Collection",

    "Soft Dogs": "The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier (Irish: An Brocaire Bu\u00ed - literally, \"Yellow Terrier\") is a pure-breed terrier originating from Ireland. Wheatens typically have one of two coat types: Irish or Heavy (American). The Irish coat is generally silkier and wavier than the Heavy, or American coat, which is thicker and fuller. Wheatens are generally friendly and playful, and tend to get along well with children and other dogs.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Wheaten was bred in Ireland for over two hundred years to be an all-purpose farm dog whose duties included herding, watching and guarding livestock, and vermin hunting and killing. They share a common ancestry with the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Irish Terrier but were not owned by gentry. In Ireland, they were commonly referred to as the \"Poor Man's Wolfhound.\"  Their tails used to be docked to avoid taxes and were often kept to a specific size.Despite its long history, the Wheaten was not recognized as a breed in Ireland by the Irish Kennel Club until 1937. In 1943, the British Kennel Club recognized the breed in the UK as well. The first Wheatens were exported to Lydia Vogel in the United States in the 1940s, but serious interest in the breed took another ten years to develop. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America, Inc. was established in 1962, seven years after the formation of The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of Great Britain. In the 1970s, the first Wheatens were imported into Australia by Anubis Kennels. In 1973, they were recognized by the American Kennel Club. The recent importation of Irish-style dogs has improved and broadened the gene pool. The American Herding Breed Association (AHBA) accepted the Wheaten in the 1990s at which point members of the breed were allowed to participate in its herding capability tests and trials. Today, Wheatens compete in obedience, agility, and tracking and are occasionally used in animal-assisted therapy as well. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier Club of America, Inc. (SCWTCA, Inc.)  is a member of the American Kennel Club which protects and advances the interests of the breed and guards against commercial exploitation. It serves breeders, owners, competition organizers and prospective owners.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\nPuppies have dark coats of red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. The reddish-brown puppy coat gradually grows out to nearly white before maturing into a wheaten-colored coat as they get older. The adult coat typically matures by 3 years old and may contain black, white, or darker brown \"guard\" hairs in addition to the lighter wheaten colored hair.  If adults ever have skin injuries, the resulting hair growth (wound hair) will be the dark color of their puppy coat before it eventually grows out to the wheat color. It may also come out to a molten chocolate color, either white or milky colored fur .The Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is a medium-sized dog, which ranges on average from 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) in height and about 30 to 45 pounds (14 to 20 kg) in weight. The breed has a square structure and is well built. Their soft, silky hair does not shed like most dogs; like human hair and Poodle hair, it keeps growing; they do need trimming and should be brushed and combed once a day to avoid mats. They are very smart dogs, and are easy to train. They love people, and they rarely have aggression issues if obtained from a reputable breeder.\n\nThe Irish coat tends to be thinner and silkier than the American variety and it has a devoted following in Ireland and Europe.  Breeders of the pure Irish type believe this is the original working coat. The coat is not thin \u2013 breeders of the Irish type consider the American heavy coat to be \"bouffant\", not that of the original working terrier type. There are a few breeders of the Irish type in the US and Canada.  In the AKC conformation show ring, the judges do not always accept the Irish type well.  The Irish is well received in the UK and Europe.  The \"Heavy Irish\" coat is usually a result of cross-breeding between coat types \u2013 American/English coat with an Irish type.  The Irish coat still requires daily brushing to stay free of matted hair.\nThe Wheatens seen in Ireland today are of the same size, shape, and coat texture as those seen and documented well over 100 years ago. Evidence of this can be seen from the famous artwork \"The Aran Fisherman's Drowned Child\" by the Irish painter Frederic William Burton.\n\n\n== Health ==\nSoft-coated Wheaten Terriers are generally a long-lived breed. They are susceptible to various heritable diseases, although are most known for two protein wasting conditions: protein-losing nephropathy (PLN), where the dogs lose protein via the kidneys; and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), where the dogs fail to fully absorb protein in their digestive tracts, causing it to pass in their stool. Both PLN and PLE are potentially fatal, but if caught early enough, can sometimes be managed with strict dietary changes and pharmaceuticals. Laboratory tests can aid in diagnosing PLN and PLE; Wheaten owners should check their country's advised testing protocols. Research suggests that PLE and PLN often are more prevalent in female wheatens and often happen in concurrence, with PLE following diagnosis of PLN. While a genetic predisposition has been suggested, an unknown mode of inheritance remains. Research programs, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom, are looking for answers.Other Wheaten health issues are renal dysplasia, inflammatory bowel disease, Addison's disease, and cancer. Some Wheatens can suffer from food and environmental allergies, and can be prone to developing the skin disease atopic dermatitis. Potential owners of Wheaten Terriers should discuss health issues with a breeder before deciding to get a puppy.\n\n\n== Temperament ==\n\nThe Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier is an energetic and playful dog. It requires patience and consistent positive training. Harsh methods will often result in fear and/or aggression.  A positive, even-handed approach works best with this intelligent yet headstrong terrier. It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the \"Wheaten greetin\". Wheatens are considered less scrappy than other terriers, but are lively and can be more active than many other breeds. For this reason these dogs do best when they are exercised regularly.They are cool-weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather. If socialised with cats and puppies, they may get along fine with them; if not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong \"prey drive\" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens are friendly and loving pets, and get along well with other dogs if properly socialised. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark in alert at strangers, they rarely get aggressive. Many Wheaten owners thus say they make great watch dogs, but poor guard dogs. Wheatens are a great dog for children and are generally friendly towards them.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDogs portal\nList of dog breeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSoft-coated Wheaten Terrier at Curlie",

    "Isabel Jay": "Isabel Emily Jay (17 October 1879 \u2013 26 February 1927) was an English opera singer and actress, best known for her performances in soprano roles of the Savoy Operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and in Edwardian musical comedies.  During Jay's career, picture postcards were immensely popular, and Jay was photographed for over 400 different postcards.\nAfter studying at the Royal Academy of Music, Jay  joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1897, with whom she began singing principal roles immediately, becoming the company's leading soprano in 1899, where she played leading roles in comic operas including The Rose of Persia, The Pirates of Penzance, Patience, The Emerald Isle and Iolanthe. She married and left the company in 1902. She returned to the West End stage in 1903 and starred in eleven musicals over the ensuing years, including A Country Girl, The Cingalee, V\u00e9ronique, The White Chrysanthemum, The Girl Behind the Counter, Miss Hook of Holland, King of Cadonia and The Balkan Princess. She retired in 1911 at age 31.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n\n=== Early life and D'Oyly Carte years ===\nJay was born in Wandsworth, London, the youngest child of John Wimburn Jay, an insurance officer, and his wife Isabelle Clara (Wicks). She was the great-granddaughter of John George Henry Jay (1770\u20131849), a musician and composer connected with the Royal Academy of Music. She began to sing in public at the age of twelve. She entered the Royal Academy of Music in 1895, where she studied piano and voice. In 1897, she was the first winner of the Gilbert R. Betjemann gold medal for operatic singing. While still at the Academy, she drew the attention of Helen Carte.\n\nOn leaving the Academy, in 1897, she joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company with a week-long trial at the Savoy Theatre, singing the part of Elsie Maynard in the first London revival of The Yeomen of the Guard. She immediately became principal soprano in a D'Oyly Carte touring company, playing the roles of Elsie, Phyllis in Iolanthe, Yum-Yum in The Mikado, Princess Lucilla Chloris in His Majesty, and later adding the roles of Aline in The Sorcerer, and Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance. A reviewer for The Era wrote of her Mabel: \"Miss Isabel Jay's bright, alert acting and fascinating personality would have condoned many deficiencies. But in addition to winning all hearts by her freshness and earnestness, Miss Jay gave us a delightfully easy and accomplished rendering of her share of the score, and the way in which she used a very valuable voice told of sound training and keen intelligence.\"Jay rejoined the main D'Oyly Carte company at the Savoy in 1898, briefly playing Gianetta and then Casilda in The Gondoliers, and soon took over the role of The Plaintiff in Trial by Jury, winning a favourable review in The Sunday Times. In early 1899, she created the small role of Alo\u00ebs in The Lucky Star, and she then filled in for Ruth Vincent for 21 performances as Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore, as well as performing again as The Plaintiff.\n\n\n=== Principal soprano ===\nLate in 1899, Vincent left the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, turning down the secondary role in The Rose of Persia when she was passed over to sing the lead, Sultana Zubeydah, which was given to Ellen Beach Yaw. Jay was initially given the small role of Blush-of-Morning. Less than two weeks later, when Yaw was dismissed, Jay was promoted to the demanding lead role and received favourable notices as the Sultana.\n\nNow the company's leading soprano, Jay played Mabel in Pirates (1900), again earning good notices, and the title role in the first London revival of Patience (1901). During the run, she was made an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music.  She then created the roles of Lady Rose Pippin in The Emerald Isle (1901) and the Gipsy Woman in Ib and Little Christina (1901). She played Phyllis in the first London revival of Iolanthe (1901\u20131902). She left the company in 1902 to marry the African explorer Henry Shepherd Cavendish, who was later the 6th Baron Waterpark.\n\n\n=== West End career ===\nAfter the birth of her first daughter, Celia Mitchell Anderson (1903\u20131997), Jay returned to the stage, taking over the role of Marjory Joy in a hit production of A Country Girl. She then starred in one West End theatre production after another \u2013 eleven in all \u2013 over a period of seven-and-a-half years. The first was the hit musical The Cingalee (1904, with Rutland Barrington and Hayden Coffin), in which she created the role of Lady Patricia Vane. In 1905 she was invited to sing before King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra at Chatsworth House, where the Queen presented her with a brooch. She was also a replacement for a pregnant Ruth Vincent in the title role of V\u00e9ronique.Later that year she was hired by Frank Curzon, a successful theatre manager, who became her mentor. Her first role with Curzon was Sybil Cunningham in The White Chrysanthemum at the Criterion in 1905 (starring with Rutland Barrington and Henry Lytton) and then on tour. In early 1906, Jay separated from her husband. Her next role was Winnie Willoughby in The Girl Behind the Counter (1906, with Hayden Coffin). For the next four years, she starred regularly in Curzon's West End productions, often at The Prince of Wales Theatre and often in a show written by Paul Rubens. These were intended to be spectacular shows, with exotic sets, elaborate costumes and beautiful chorus girls. Her roles during these years included Olivia in Liza Lehmann's The Vicar of Wakefield (1906, based on the novel of the same name), Sally in Miss Hook of Holland (1906, running for a very successful 462 performances), Paulette in My Mimosa Maid (1908), Princess Marie in King of Cadonia (1908), Christina in Dear Little Denmark (1909), and Princess Stephanie in The Balkan Princess (1910).\n \nJay and Curzon married on 28 July 1910. After the end of the run of The Balkan Princess in 1911, Jay retired from the stage at only 31 years of age, and she had a second child, Pamela Stephanie Curzon, in 1915. In 1923 in her only return to the stage, Jay created the role of Anne West, with Curzon as suitor James Hathaway and daughter Celia in her stage debut as Angela West, in a play of Jay's own authorship, The Inevitable. The play toured Hastings, Eastbourne, Littlehampton and Brighton, before opening for a short run at the St. James Theatre. During her career, more than 400 different postcards with Jay's image were issued.\n\n\n=== Early death ===\nJay's health began to deteriorate due to the effects of scarlet fever as a child, and she died at age 47 in Monte Carlo, having been on a cruise with her husband. In recognition of her achievements, the Royal Academy of Music two years later instituted the Isabel Jay Memorial Prize.\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nJay made 19 recordings between 1900 and 1906, mostly of pieces from her early musical comedies. She also recorded \"Poor Wand'ring One\" from Pirates in 1900 and twice more in 1904. One of the latter recordings is heard on the Pearl recording \"The Art of the Savoyard.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCannon, John. \"Old Favourites: Isabel Jay\" in The Savoyard, the magazine of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Trust, Vol. XVII No.1, May 1978.\nAyre, Leslie (1972).

    "Portland Branch Railway": "The Portland Branch railway was a railway line located on the Isle of Portland in the English county of Dorset. The line operated from the late nineteenth century until closing to passengers in 1952 and goods in 1965. For a short line, it had a complex history, built in three separate sections and operated jointly by two rival railway companies. Its construction needed twelve years of blasting through solid rock and three extensions of Parliamentary time.\n\n\n== Inception ==\nThe need in the early 1820s to transport stone led to an older railway, the Merchant's Railway, being promoted. A public company authorised by Act of Parliament, the company existed for a long time after the closure of the railway. The railway initially consisted of a tramway, then an incline from Priory Corner to Castletown Pier. This was a distinct railway from the later Portland Branch, although an attempt by the Easton and Church Hope railway to take it over failed at the parliamentary stage. The line was at any event not standard gauge and the stock not compatible with main line standards.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nA line from Weymouth to Portland was part of the original plan for the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway but not followed through. Then in 1861 two schemes were put forward, one down Weymouth Backwater and another including a harbour tramway. The harbour scheme was constructed. An Agreement of 1862 leased the line in perpetuity to the GWR and the LSWR who agreed to work it jointly. Construction of the Weymouth and Portland railway started at the end of 1862 and was completed by April 1864. A need for further work on the timber viaducts over the backwater and The Fleet held up the opening until September when another year was spent arguing about where the trains should go in Weymouth station. The line was mixed gauge when it opened on 16 October 1865.\nIn 1866 another line, the Easton and Church Hope, was proposed on the other side of the Isle of Portland. Initially it was to link Portland's quarries to the sea.  This line was started but powers expired in 1872 and the line lay dormant for eleven years. In the meantime an Admiralty railway was built from the end of the Weymouth and Portland line to a pier on the new Admiralty Breakwater, mainly to supply coal to ships. The Easton and Church Hope was revived with hopes of running powers over this line but although construction was authorised in 1884 none was undertaken until 1888. When it did the work involved blasting through three and a half miles of solid rock in a task taking twelve years. A new station was completed at Easton in 1900. A delay caused by the need to bring the Admiralty stretch up to passenger standard followed. The Admiralty terminated its agreement with the GWR and LSWR, allowing the Easton and Church Hope to carry out the work itself. The line opened to passenger traffic on 1 September 1902.\nThis left the north coast of Portland served by three different railways in a very short distance.\n\n\n== Operation ==\n\nAlthough worked as a continuous line the Weymouth and Portland and Easton and Church Hope companies nominally remained independent until nationalisation in 1948.   In 1908 to 1909 as part of a GWR plan to fight road competition halts were opened on the line, at Westham and Wyke Regis, and Rodwell station was enlarged and a loop installed. In 1908 the wooden backwater bridge was replaced and some land reclaimed. A separate station, known as Melcombe Regis, was built at the northern end of the bridge to save the branch train from having to reverse to enter Weymouth Station. Sandsfoot Castle Halt opened in 1932.\n\n\n== The final years ==\nThe branch closed to passenger traffic in 1952, remaining open for goods traffic until 1965. Although it officially closed in 1952, Melcombe Regis Station was retained as an overflow of the main Weymouth station, notably on summer Saturdays,  until 1959. The backwater bridge remained until it collapsed in a storm in November 1974, and was subsequently demolished.\n\n\n== The line today ==\nToday, parts of the line can still be walked, but the course of the backwater railway viaduct has long since been replaced by Weymouth\u2019s Swannery road bridge, which was built in virtually the same place. The former platforms at Westham and Rodwell are still to be seen and this section is a popular green trailway, the Rodwell Trail.  The bridge over The Fleet at Smallmouth was demolished in 1972. The route now passes through a boatyard, then along the Portland causeway over open common land. Reaching the southwest corner of Portland Harbour, the route now lies under a landscaped earthen embankment, which marks the edge of Portland's National Sailing Academy. Here, there is little evidence of the old railway, until east of Castletown, within Portland Port, where it re-emerges to climb the steep hillside of East Weares. This section has become a fine walk and leads to the spectacular cliffside cutting above Church Ope Cove. This section made it one of the most scenic coastal branch lines in the south of England; it is now part of Dorset's World Heritage Jurassic Coast.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nR.V.J.

    "Michael York (religious studies scholar)": "Michael York is a UK-based American Religious Studies scholar who specializes in the study of pre-Christian European religion and its relation to contemporary Paganism. In 2003, he published Pagan Theology, in which he put forward the idea that the ancient pre-Christian and pre-Islamic religions of Eurasia, indigenous religions from across the globe, and contemporary Pagan faiths could all be constituted as forms of paganism. Michael York participated in TEDxLambeth 2019 as a speaker.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nDescribing his own religious beliefs and his affection for paganism, York remarked that:\n\nIf I had to name my own denominational predilection, I would say that I am a \"religionist.\" I believe in religion itself and its central role in expanding human consciousness above and beyond immediate daily concerns. I see religion as an ongoing dialogue that questions the purpose of life and our terrestrial incarnations. In my own pursuit and love of religion as religion, I have been particularly attracted to paganism not only as the source and origin of all religion but also as an organic alternative to the institutionalized and parochial insularity that much religious expression has become.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nYork, Michael (2003).

    "The Purge: Election Year": "The Purge: Election Year is a 2016 American dystopian  political  action horror film written and directed by James DeMonaco and starring Frank Grillo, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Mykelti Williamson. It is the sequel to 2014's The Purge: Anarchy and is the third installment in the Purge franchise. Jason Blum and Michael Bay are among the film's producers.\nThe film was released on July 1, 2016, and received mixed reviews from critics. It earned more than $118 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series before being passed by the fourth film/prequel, The First Purge, in July 2018. A direct sequel, The Forever Purge, was released in July 2021 due to delay from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 2022, a young Charlene \"Charlie\" Roan and her family are tied up by a masked Purger. He taunts them with his \"purge playlist\", and then tells them they will play a final Purge game called \"Mommy's Choice,\" where the mother chooses the sole survivor while everyone else dies. Charlie is chosen and forced to watch as her mother, father, and brother are killed.\nEighteen years later, in 2040, Roan is a U.S. Senator campaigning for the U.S. Presidency, promising executive action to end the annual Purge nights. Former police sergeant Leo Barnes is now head of security for Roan. The New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) and their candidate, Minister Edwidge Owens, view Roan as a threat; under the pretense of regaining public trust, they revoke immunity for government officials, including her, on Purge night.\nWatching the presidential debate are deli owner Joe Dixon, his assistant Marcos, and former Purger turned EMT Laney Rucker. A pair of teenage girls try to shoplift, only to be cornered by Joe. The girls mock Joe until Laney intervenes; recognizing her as a famous ex-Purger, they leave peacefully. Joe receives a call stating the cost of his Purge insurance has been raised far beyond affordability, prompting him to guard his store himself, despite Marcos and Laney's pleas not to. At the same time, the country's so-called \"murder tourism\" booms the economy due to tourists visiting the U.S. to participate in the annual Purge nights.\nAs the Purge begins, Joe guards his store and is joined by Marcos, repelling an attack by the teen girls seeking revenge. Laney and her partner Dawn patrol the city in an ambulance, providing medical care to the wounded. Roan decides to wait out the Purge from her home rather than a secure location to secure the vote, and is accompanied by Barnes, Chief Couper, Eric, and additional security forces. However, Couper and Eric are revealed to be NFFA operatives after allowing a neo-Nazi paramilitary force led by Earl Danzinger to kill the security detail and invade the house. Barnes escorts Roan to safety, but is wounded by a bullet. He detonates a bomb in the house, killing Eric and Couper.\nNavigating the hostile streets of Washington D.C., Barnes and Roan attempt to seek shelter, but are ambushed by a gang of Murder Tourists. Before they can be executed, Joe and Marcos kill the gang, having seen the pair's plight from the store's rooftop. As they take shelter in the store, the teens return with reinforcements. However, Laney runs over two of them and kills half the group. As the other Purgers threaten to break in, they leave for a safer hideout. The team is ambushed by Danzinger in a helicopter, and seek refuge beneath an overpass wherein Barnes realizes they were tracked by the bullet in his shoulder, which he promptly removes. After a confrontation with a large number of Crips, which Joe was previously a member of, the team helps their leader's fellow injured Crip. In return, the Crips plant the bullet in another area to divert the paramilitary team, whom they eliminate while Danzinger observes from his radio.\nThe team arrives at an underground anti-Purge hideout run by Dante Bishop. During their stay, Barnes and Roan discover that Bishop's group intends to assassinate the NFFA's leadership, in an effort to end the Purge. As Roan pleads to Bishop's partner, Angel, not to kill Owens, they are alerted by Dawn of a large paramilitary group arriving in search of Bishop and Roan. Barnes and Roan escape back to the streets and reunite with Joe, Marcos, and Laney, who had left the hideout earlier to return to Joe's store.\nBarnes orders to flee from the city but on their way, the ambulance is hit by Danzinger's team. Roan is pulled from the van by the soldiers before anyone can assist. Barnes leads the group and Bishop's team to a fortified cathedral where the NFFA will \"sacrifice\" her, after NFFA loyalist Harmon James stabs a drug addict to death. Before Roan can be killed, the group arrives and Marcos assassinates US President and NFFA leader Caleb Warrens, causing a shootout that kills the entire congregation except Owens and James, who escape. Owens is caught by Bishop's group, but Roan manages to persuade them to spare him, thus preventing her from losing the election. The remaining paramilitary forces arrive, killing Bishop and his team. Danzinger and Barnes engage in a melee, where Barnes beats and stabs Danzinger to death. As Roan and the team free the other imprisoned purge victims, James emerges and kills a released prisoner before engaging Joe in a gunfight. Although his wounds will soon be fatal, Joe manages to shoot James point-blank in the head. He then asks Laney and Marcos to take care of his store before succumbing to his injuries.\nTwo months later, Roan wins the election in a landslide, while Barnes is appointed the new Director of the Secret Service. Marcos and Laney renovate Joe's store, which had been looted and demolished by the surviving half of the teens' group, and continue to run it in his memory. A news report then states that NFFA supporters have staged violent uprisings across the country protesting election results and the end of the annual purge nights.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nOn October 6, 2014, it was announced that James DeMonaco would be back to write and direct the third film, while producers Sebastian Lemercier, Blumhouse Productions' Jason Blum, and Platinum Dunes partners Michael Bay, Andrew Form, and Brad Fuller, would also be back. On August 3, 2015, it was announced that Frank Grillo would return for the sequel to play Leo Barnes. On September 10, 2015, more cast was announced, including Betty Gabriel, Edwin Hodge, Kyle Secor, Joseph Julian Soria, Mykelti Williamson, and Elizabeth Mitchell.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nShooting began on September 16, 2015. Although a few scenes were filmed in Washington, DC, most of the movie was shot in Rhode Island, both in its capital Providence, and Woonsocket.The main streets of Woonsocket were transformed into the near-future Washington, DC. The NFFA-captured Catholic cathedral where Owens' purge mass takes place, as well as the cathedral crypt scenes, were filmed at the St. Ann's Church Complex. The Rhode Island State House stood in as the White House and its rotunda and some of its interiors such as the Press Room and basement were also used for filming. Numerous landmarks of both Woonsocket and Providence make cameos in the film. The Roan household was shot in another part of Woonsocket and some of the interiors were shot on a soundstage to allow more room for cameras and crew.\n\n\n== Music ==\nNathan Whitehead returned to compose the score, having done the music for the first two Purge films. The soundtrack was released on July 1, 2016, to coincide with the release of the film.\n\n\n== Release ==\nOriginally, the film was set to be released on Monday, July 4, 2016, to coincide with the Fourth of July, but was moved to Friday, July 1.\nIt was released in the United Kingdom on August 26.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nThe Purge: Election Year was released on  digital platforms on September 20, 2016 and on Blu-ray and DVD on October 4, 2016.

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $31.4 million, landing in between the $34 million debut for the first film and the $29 million opening for the second, and finished third at the box office behind Finding Dory ($41.4 million) and The Legend of Tarzan ($38.6 million). The film grossed a total of $34.8 million over its four-day July 4 holiday frame.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 56% based on 161 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"It isn't particularly subtle, but The Purge: Election Year's blend of potent jolts and timely themes still add up to a nastily effective diversion.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100 based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.A.O.

    "Abbey of Santa Maria in Sylvis": "The Abbey of Santa Maria in Sylvis (Italian: Abbazia di Santa Maria in Silvis) is a monastery in the centre of Sesto al Reghena, in the province of Pordenone, north-eastern Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe abbey, founded around 730\u2013735 AD, belonged to the Benedictines until 762. After the fall of the Lombard Kingdom in 774 and the subsequent rebellion of Friuli in 776, the abbey had all its properties confirmed by Charlemagne through a chart including total exemption from any tax obligation to lay authorities.\nIn 899 it was ravaged by a Magyar raid, and was restored in the 10th century, including the addition of fortifications. In 967 emperor Otto I donated it to Rodoald, patriarch of Aquileia. In the following years the abbey prospered, commissioning numerous paintings, sculptures and architectural additions to Venetian-Friulian artists. One of its abbot, Godfrey, was elected patriarch of Aquileia in 1182.\nFrom 1441 to 1786, the abbey was a commandry; its first lay abbot was cardinal Pietro Barbo, later Pope Paul II; in the following centuries he was succeeded in general by members of noble families from the Republic of Venice. In 1818 it returned to the diocese of Concordia and in 1921 it was restored as an abbey.\n\n\n== Description ==\nAlthough some form of fortification existed from the abbey's very beginnings, a true line of walls was added in the 10th century after the Magyar assault. In 1431 it had up to seven towers, only one of which remains today; this was restored to the current Renaissance appearance by lay abbots Giovanni Michiel and Domenico Grimani (late 15th\u2013early 16th centuries), while in the 18th century a stone bridge replaced the previous drawbridge.\nThe entrance fa\u00e7ade is decorated by a late 15th-century fresco with the Lion of St. Mark. Below it is a bas-relief with cardinal Grimani's coat of arms, dated to 1521 and repeated on the left. Further below is an allegory of the Good Government under the Grimani family, attributed to Giovanni Battista Grassi.\n\nThe entrance leads to a central court, faced by the abbey's main buildings. These include the bell tower, standing at 33.6 m (110 ft), built in brickwork in the 11th\u201312th centuries and decorated by a series of arcades. At the side of the tower is a Renaissance portal  with a round arch supported by pillars, dating from the Michiel and Grimani restorations.\n\nWest of the bell tower is the Palazzo della Cancelleria (\"Chancellor's Palace\"), built in brickwork in the 12th\u201313th centuries, with a height of 9 m (30 ft). In front of it is the Abbot's Residence, featuring coats of arms of several lay abbots, including  Giovanni Alberto Badoer, Carlo Pio di Savoia-Carpi, Girolamo Colonna di Sciarra and Giovanni Cornaro. This edifice is the current town hall of Sesto al Reghena.\nThe church has a vestibule dating from Pietro Barbo's period, with two fresco cycles  of the Paradise (southern wall) and Inferno (northern wall) by Antonio da Firenze and Pellegrino da San Daniele. Under the church is a crypt supported by twenty columns, some of which are  ancient spolia. At the center of the crypt is the Urn of St. Anastasia, formed by a single marble block of Greek origin; it was realized by Cividale masters in the 8th century, and has decorations with flowers, crosses, arches, tondoes and rose motifs. The crypt also houses, in two apses, a Piet\u00e0 of Austrian origin (early 15th century) and an Annunciation sculpted in Slovenian marble showing Byzantine influences, dating from the late 13th\u2013early 14th century.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGian Carlo Menis, Enrica Cozzi, ed.

    "Kenai National Wildlife Refuge": "The Kenai National Wildlife Refuge is a 1.92-million-acre (7,770 km2) wildlife habitat preserve located on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska, United States. It is adjacent to Kenai Fjords National Park. This refuge was created in 1941 as the Kenai National Moose Range, but in 1980 it was changed to its present status by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The refuge is administered from offices in Soldotna.\n\n\n== Terrain, Flora, and Fauna ==\nThere is a wide variety of terrain in the refuge, including muskeg and other wetlands, alpine areas, and taiga forest.  The refuge protects several large mammals, including wolf packs, brown bears, black bears, dall sheep, moose, Canadian lynx, and caribou, as well as thousands of migratory and native birds. There are numerous lakes, including two very large lakes, Skilak Lake and Tustumena Lake as well as the Kenai River, and the refuge is a popular destination for fishing for salmon and trout.\n\n\n== Activities ==\n\n\n=== Boating and Camping ===\nThe refuge has several campgrounds and boat launches, including two developed campgrounds, one at Hidden Lake and another at Skilak Lake, both accessible from Skilak Lake Loop Road, which intersects the Sterling Highway at both ends. Other less-developed campgrounds and campsites are accessible from the Sterling Highway, Skilak Loop Road, Swanson River Road, and Swan Lake Road, the later of which do not require fees to access. Since 2005 the refuge has offered 16 cabins for public use via a reservation system, with some cabins accessible only via boat.\n\n\n==== Canoe trails ====\nThe Kenai National Wildlife Refuge has multiple small canoe systems linking lakes or groups of lakes. It further possess two larger canoe trails, which link large networks of lakes and rivers, often via portages. The most popular, the Swan Lake Canoe Trail, travels 60 miles, beginning at Canoe Lake (the west entrance), and terminates alternatively at Portage Lake (the east entrance) or the confluence of the Moose and Kenai rivers in Sterling. The longest, the Swanson River Canoe Route, spanning 80 miles, begins either at Paddle Lake or Gene Lake, and ends where the Swanson River meets the Cook Inlet at Captain Cook State Park.\n\n\n=== Hiking ===\nThere are over 110 miles of hiking trails in the refuge, accessed from the Sterling Highway, Skilak Lake Loop Road, Swanson River Road, various campgrounds, and the refuge visitor center and headquarters. These hikes range from difficult, multi-day back-country hikes to easier, short paved-trail walks.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\nAs with most national wildlife refuges, the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge is open to hunting with certain restrictions, in particular in the area of Skilak Lake Road. \n\n\n== Wildfires ==\nNaturally occurring wildfires are seen as beneficial in the long run for boreal forests, and so many areas of the Refuge are classified as limited suppression areas and firs may be allowed to burn unchecked so long as they do not move toward populated areas or Refuge facilities. In any given year there is a high likelihood of several small fires burning within the refuge. \nIn 2009 lightning ignited the Shanta Creek Wildfire, which burned over 10,000 acres (4,000 ha) of Refuge land before it began moving toward populated areas outside of Soldotna and was aggressively fought to keep it from endangering these areas.  \nThe Funny River Fire, a human-caused fire that began on May 19, 2014, had burned largely in the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge. During firefighting activities, a wolf den was damaged by a bulldozer and 5 pups (3 males and 2 females) were rescued by firefighters. The pups were taken to the Alaska Zoo and were later transferred to the Minnesota Zoo.In 2019, lightning again ignited a major wildfire, named the Swan Lake Fire, and again it was allowed to burn unchecked for some time, until it began to threaten the communities of Sterling and Cooper Landing, as well the Sterling Highway and the Refuge's Skilak Lake Road, the only roads allowing access to towns on the lower Kenai Peninsula.

The University was established to fill an important gap for open, telematic and distance education in the higher education system of the Republic of Cyprus, in response to the growing demand for continuing education and lifelong learning. It is the first and only Higher Education Institution (HEI) in Cyprus that provides open and distance education at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Placing great emphasis on research, the OUC promotes research programmes aiming towards the development of methodologies and corresponding high technologies for open and distance learning.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nThe Open University of Cyprus style of teaching is called \"open and distance learning\". More specifically, students have the opportunity to learn in their own time without having to be present at the premises of the University to be able to attend lectures, seminars or labs, as it is the case with conventional universities.The Open University's degree structure and credit system is based on the concept of Thematic Units (or Modules) adaptable to the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). The teaching load of an OUC's Thematic Unit corresponds to approximately three (3) semesters at any conventional university. The duration of each Thematic Unit is ten (10) months. OUC students have access to an e-learning platform, an electronic portal where practical information concerning studies at the Open University and related regulations and procedures are posted, as well as information regarding Study Courses, course materials and student workload.\n\n\n== Programmes of study ==\nThe full course catalogue for the 2018-2019 academic year include the following programmes:\nAt the postgraduate level, programmes offered in English:\n\nMaster of Business Administration (MBA)\nSustainable Enterprise Systems (joint degree with Frederick University)\nCognitive Systems (joint degree with University of Cyprus)\nEnterprise Risk Management (joint degree with Hellenic Open University)At the undergraduate level, programmes offered in Greek:\n\nBusiness Administration\nPolice Studies (only for graduates of the Cyprus Police Academy)\nStudies in the Hellenic Culture\nEconomicsAt the postgraduate level, programmes offered in Greek:\n\nApplied Health Informatics\nBanking and Finance\nCommunications and Journalism\nContinuing Education and Lifelong Learning\nCultural Policy and Development\nEducational Studies\nEnvironment Conservation and Management\nEuropean Union Law\nGreek Language and Literature\nHealthcare Management\nHealth Policy and Planning\nManagement, Technology and Quality\nBusiness Administration (MBA)\nSocial Information Systems\nTheater Studies\nComputer and Network Security\nWireless Communication systems\n\n\n=== Cooperating universities ===\nHellenic Open University since 1 March 2013\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nCyprus Ministry of Higher Education",

It was the first appearance of the event.The competition was held from Saturday to Wednesday, 13 to 17 July 1912 for a period of five days, with a day rest after the first two events. A maximum of four riders from each nation was allowed. The entries closed on 1 June 1912. Every rider had to ride only one and the same horse in the event.\n\n\n== Results ==\nThe start and finish were both on the grounds of the Field Riding Club. In consequence of the hot weather prevailing, the ground was very hard. All the competitors were previously shown the course, which was marked with red flags. In addition to this, a map of the course and definite instructions were given by the guides to the competitors.\n\n\n=== Trial 1 \u2013 Long distance ride ===\nSaturday, 13 July: 8 a.m. (Starting interval five minutes) Course of the \"F\u00e4ltridtklubben\" (Stockholm Cross Country Riding Club) Riders had 4 hours to cover a distance of 55 kilometres.

One rider did not start and one rider was disqualified due to riding the wrong way. Bryan Lawrence did not finish the race after falling at a grass-covered ditch outside the course. The accident causing a slight concussion of the brain, from which the rider soon recovered, however.

    "Adana Conference": "The Adana Conference or Yenice Conference (Turkish: Adana G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015fmesi , Adana M\u00fclakat\u0131  or Yenice G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015fmesi , Yenice M\u00fclakat\u0131 ) was a meeting between Turkish President \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in a railway car parking on a storage track at Yenice, near Adana on 30\u201331 January 1943, where Churchill tried to persuade \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc to join the Allied powers and fight the Axis powers during World War II.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe event came to be known as the Adana Meeting, although it was held in Yenice, between Adana and Mersin. Adana had the nearest airport to Yenice.Yenice a town in Mersin Province is the junction of the Adana\u2013Mersin Railway Line and the main railway from Ankara, the \u0130stanbul-Ba\u011fdat Railway.\nThe location was a compromise after a series of talks between the Turkish Foreign Ministry and the British embassy. The British had wanted it to be in Cyprus, then part of the British Empire, and the Turkish had preferred Ankara.\n\n\n== Background ==\nDuring World War II, all of Turkey's neighbours had joined the Axis or the Allies. In the west, Bulgaria was an ally of Nazi Germany, and Greece was occupied by German troops. Dodecanese, including Rhodes was part of Italy. The USSR was a neighbour in the northeast. To the south were Syria, which had joined the Free France; and Iraq, part of the British Empire. To the east, Iran was under joint USSR-British occupation. Turkey, however, managed to maintain its neutral status.\nDuring the Casablanca Conference (14\u201324 January 1943), Churchill proposed to force Turkey to join the Allies in the war. General George Marshall and other high-ranking US military showed reluctance for fear that the extension of the war to a new Turkish front would \"burn the Allied logistics down the line\". However, US President Franklin Roosevelt gave Churchill the green light on 18 January to \"play the Turkish hand\". On 25 January, Churchill asked for an appointment from \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc, and the Adana Meeting was held just after the conference, between 30 January and 1 February 1943.\n\n\n== Meeting ==\n\nThe teams were headed by \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and Winston Churchill. The other members of the Turkish side were Prime Minister \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Saraco\u011flu, Foreign Minister Numan Menemencio\u011flu, Field Marshal Fevzi \u00c7akmak and a group of advisers. The British team had Harold Alexander, Henry Maitland Wilson, Sir Alan Brooke, Sir Wilfred Lindsell, Alexander Cadogan (foreign ministry), Air Marshal Drummond and Commodore Dundas.During the meeting, the British tried to persuade the Turkish side to join the Allies, but \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc showed extreme reluctance to join the war. Churchill made lavish promises of military help (codenamed Operation Hardihood). A list of military equipment was drawn up, the Adana Lists, which Churchill later said would provide Turkey with war material \"to the full capacity of Turkish railways\". In turn, Churchill requested access to Turkish air bases for the Royal Air Force so that the British could bomb the oil fields of Ploie\u015fti, Romania, the principal source of oil for Germany and the Italian positions in the Dodecanese. To put pressure on the Turks to give up their neutrality, Churchill made clear that if Turkey refused to join the Allies, he would not try to stop the Soviets from moving to control the Dardanelles.\nThe military advisors went in borrowed and ill-fitting plain clothes. Brooke was not impressed by the poor security for Churchill. He hoped that Turkey\u2019s neutrality will from now on assume a far more biased nature in favour of the allies, and while the Turkish forces could not have been trained to be of much use, the real value would have been the use of aerodromes and as a jumping-off place for future action. But he said that his wild dreams about Turkey remained that, as Von Papen fooled the Turks about fictitious concentrations of German troops in Bulgaria, which never existed. \n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nIn April 1943, a British military delegation of General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson requested access for 25 RAF fighter squadrons to Turkish airports. In the latter stages of the operation, the British planned on sending two full armoured divisions to Turkey. The Turks, however, were very fearful of the strong German military presence in Bulgaria and drowned the British military delegation with red tape. While giving Maitland Wilson every courtesy, the Turks started 'tortuous and interminable negotiations'. Wilson urged Turkish commanders to teach their men mechanical skills but noted that meant that prospective tank crews 'had to be taught the workings of the internal combustion engine from page one of the book'. When the construction of Turkish airfields went ahead of schedule, \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was warned that work was proceeding too rapidly. The British frustration about the Turkish stalling tactics led to a serious deterioration of diplomatic relations between the two countries in the summer of 1943.\nHowever, the disastrous British Dodecanese Campaign on 13 September 1943, where the Germans easily fought off a British assault, ended the strife. The display of German strength only 20 km (12 mi) southwest of the Turkish coast convinced the Turkish government that it been right to keep its neutrality. After the fiasco, the British were now anxious to keep Turkey neutral.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSecond Cairo Conference\nList of World War II conferences\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAlanbrooke, Field Marshal Lord (2001).

    "Alan Walters": "Sir Alan Arthur Walters (17 June 1926 \u2013 3 January 2009) was a British economist who was best known as the Chief Economic Adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher from 1981 to 1983 and (after his return from the United States) again for five months in 1989.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nWalters was born in Leicester, and his father was a Communist and a grocer who sold goods from a van. He failed his 11-Plus and attended Alderman Newton's School in Leicester, leaving at fifteen to work as a machine operator in a shoe factory. During World War II, he was called up and joined the British Army as a private.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nWalters studied statistics at University College Leicester and then went to Nuffield College, Oxford, where he took an MA in economics. On leaving Nuffield in 1951, he took up a post to teach statistics at Birmingham University, later becoming professor of econometrics and statistics there in the early 1960s. He was one of the first British economists to argue that money was \"of considerable importance\" to economic activity, a view that became more widespread during \"the Great Inflation\" of the 1970s. He argued forcefully that Britain should maintain strict monetary targets, and that the money supply should not be manipulated for political reasons.In 1968\u201370 he was a member of the Commission on the Third London Airport (the \"Roskill Commission\").After serving as a professor at the London School of Economics from 1968 to 1976, where he was Sir Ernest Cassel Professor of Economics, Walters became an economic adviser to the World Bank and a professor in the Economics Department at The Johns Hopkins University.\nOne of his most important contributions to economic theory was to demonstrate empirically that, for many industries, the costs at the high-scale end of the long-run cost curve is essentially constant or even declining. This was established in his article \"Production and Cost Functions: An Econometric Survey\", published by the journal Econometrica.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1981, he was asked to become an economic adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (who was elected in the 1979 general election), and advised on that year's budget, in which taxes were increased during a recession. This policy produced much criticism and was associated with rioting and high unemployment, but it has been claimed that it enabled the sustained economic growth of the 1990s. He left this role in 1983 to join the American Enterprise Institute and at least some aspects of monetarist policies were publicly repudiated by Thatcher in 1985. He did, however, return to advise Thatcher in 1989, but his differences with the policies of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, led to the resignation of both men on 26 October 1989.Walters supported the controversial and ill-fated Community Charge (referred to as the \"poll tax\").  He opposed the similarly ill-fated policy of entry into the European Monetary System. In 1997, he stood as the Referendum Party candidate for the safe Conservative seat of the Cities of London and Westminster achieving 3% of the vote.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1975, Walters married Margaret Patricia Wilson, known as Paddie. He had a daughter by a previous marriage. He was knighted in the Queen's 1983 Birthday Honours List.\nHe was an accomplished pianist, enjoying playing the works of Chopin and Beethoven. He also collected Thai porcelain and was a keen tennis player.Walters was vice-chairman and Director of AIG Trading Group, Inc.Towards the end of his life, he suffered from Parkinson's disease. He died aged 82 at his home on 3 January 2009 after a short illness. Upon hearing of his death, Thatcher described him as \"radical, fearless\" and the \"finest of friends\". Coincidentally he died on the same day that the first \"Genesis\" block of the cryptocurrency and decentralized payment system Bitcoin was established.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAppearances on C-SPAN\nThe Papers of Sir Alan Walters held at Churchill Archives Centre",
    "Eddy Djadjang Djajaatmadja": "Eddy Djadjang Djajaatmadja (born 1928 or 1929) is an Indonesian army officer and bureaucrat who served as the mayor of Central Jakarta from 1966 until 1979 and as the acting governor of Central Sulawesi from 1979 until 1980.\n\n\n== Military career ==\nDjajaatmadja was appointed as the spokesperson to the Commander of the Jakarta Military Region at that time, Umar Wirahadikusumah. During his tenure as spokesperson, Djajaatmadja was involved in a controversy between him and the Communist Party of Indonesia when he accused several members of the party's politburo of wrongdoings in a statement announced on 22 July 1959. The party's politburo sent a letter to the Jakarta's military court three days later, stating that Djajaatmadja has defamed the party and demanded him to be tried in the military court.At the National Awakening Day celebrations held on 20 May 1959, Djajaatmadja announced that Jakarta residents who did not hoist the Indonesian flag during the day were given warning. He stated that actions would be taken against the residents if they failed to hoist the flag for the second time.Djajaatmadja was transferred to hold command as the Commander of the Tangerang Military District. He still held the position after the reorganization of military districts in Jakarta in 1966. He left the position after he was appointed as the Mayor of Jakarta a month later.\n\n\n== Mayor of Jakarta ==\n\nDjajaatmadja became the Mayor of Central Jakarta on 26 August 1966 and continued to held office for another thirteen years. During his tenure, Djajaatmadja was involved in the development of pencak silat martial arts organization. He was initially elected as the chairman of the Jakarta's pencak silat organization in 1978 before becoming the daily chairman of the central pencak silat organization. He was later replaced as daily chairman by Eddie Marzuki Nalaparya after ending his mayoral term and due to frequent health complications.\n\n\n== Governor of Central Sulawesi ==\nDjajatmadja was sworn in as the acting governor of Central Sulawesi on 22 October 1979 after his predecessor, Moenafri, was ousted due to alleged disloyalty to the central government. He refused to live in the official governor's residence and lived in the guest house as a governor. During his governorship, the province's annual budget increased sharply from twenty-five billion rupiahs to fifty-four billion rupiahs.Several riots occurred in Central Sulawesi as an aftermath of Moenafri's removal. A group of students clashed and damaged the house of several Central Sulawesi bureaucrats. The students later demanded the removal of regional secretary B. L. Sallata from his office. Djajaatmadja refused to fulfill the demands, stating that he had been instructed by the Minister of Home Affairs not to remove any of the Central Sulawesi bureaucrats from their offices for the time being.Djajaatmadja's acting term ended after he handed over his office to acting governor Eddy Sabara. The newspaper Tempo rumored that Djajaatmadja was removed due to his inability in organizing an election for a definitive governor. Djajaatmadja denied the allegations, stating that the matter was handled by the province's parliament and not by him.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Henry Waldo Coe": "Henry Waldo Coe (November 4, 1857 \u2013 February 15, 1927) was a United States frontier physician and politician.\nCoe was born in Waupun, Wisconsin, to Samuel Buel Coe and his wife Mary Jane (n\u00e9e Cronkhite). After his education and training, Coe went on to become a pioneer doctor in the Dakota Territory, a member of the territorial legislature, and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWhen he was very young Coe and his parents moved to Morristown, Minnesota. After graduating from high school, Coe took classes at the University of Minnesota.  He supplemented his studies under the tutelage of his father, also a physician, and attending classes at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. He graduated from Long Island College Hospital in New York in July 1880. He moved to Mandan, North Dakota and was among the first physicians to settle in the Dakota Territory. He was elected to the last territorial legislature (1885) before the territory was divided and achieved statehood. He also served as mayor of Mandan.While in the Dakota Territory, Coe met the young Theodore Roosevelt, who had gone there to regain his health. Their friendship lasted until Roosevelt's death in 1919.He and his wife Viola (Boley) Coe, also a physician, moved to Portland, Oregon in 1890 where they focused on treating nervous and mental diseases, and where he owned and operated the Morningside Hospital. He quickly rose to a prominent position in financial and political affairs of the Northwest. He was president of the First National Bank of St. Johns, Oregon, president of the First National Bank of Kelso, Washington, vice-president of the Scandinavian-American Bank of Portland, Oregon, director of the Scandinavian-American Savings Bank of Astoria, Oregon, one of the proprietors of the \u0421\u043e\u0435-Furnish Irrigation Project of Stanfield, Oregon, and also had extensive mining interests.\nIn 1906, he was president of the American Medical Editor's Association.Always an active Republican he was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions at Chicago in 1904 and 1908, and in 1906 and 1907 was a member for Portland in the Oregon State Senate. As a close friend of Theodore Roosevelt, during his presidency Coe served as a confidential representative of his interest in Oregon.  He and his wife would be invited on numerous occasions to lunch at the White House, as guests of both President Theodore Roosevelt and Howard Taft. Dr. Coe and his wife were among a group assigned in 1907 to travel to Panama to report to then President Theodore Roosevelt on working conditions during the construction of the Panama Canal. Henry Waldo Coe would later serve as one of the party leaders of the national Progressive Party i.e. \"Bull Moose Party\" in the early 1900s. He served a president of Oregon's Roosevelt League.After retiring from practice in 1920, Henry and his second wife traveled extensively in Europe, Africa, Asia, and South America. He died after a heart attack in Glendale, California.\n\n\n== Statues ==\n\n\n=== Oregon ===\nCoe commissioned and donated four statues to the city of Portland in the 1920s.The Alexander Phimister Proctor statue of Theodore Roosevelt, is in the South Park Blocks. Coe knew Roosevelt in 1884-1886 and went on hunting trips with him. Coe paid $40,000 for the statue.The equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, in Laurelhurst, Portland, Oregon, was made from the original molds of Emmanuel Fr\u00e9miet's statue at the Place des Pyramides, which Coe saw on a visit to France. Portland's Arc statue arrived from France in 1924 and was dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1925, honoring the Doughboys of World War I.Two additional statues were in progress but were erected after Coe's death in 1927. One is the statue of Abraham Lincoln by George Fife Waters, commissioned in 1926 and dedicated at its South Park Blocks location on October 5, 1928. The second was George Washington, a statue by Pompeo Coppini, which was dedicated on July 4, 1927. It stood at 57th Avenue and Sandy Boulevard, in the center of the Rose City Park neighborhood, until the mass protests of 2020.\n\n\n=== North Dakota ===\nCoe would donate a copies of \"Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider\" statue to two cities in North Dakota.   According to the Inventory of American Sculpture (IAS), the Mandan, North Dakota sculpture is a smaller version of the one commissioned by Coe for Portland in 1920. This statue was dedicated on July 2, 1924, and is located downtown in Heritage Park. A second small version of the statue was also created and donated to the City of Minot, North Dakota by Coe in 1924.  It is a key feature of the city's Roosevelt Park.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHenry Waldo Coe at Find a Grave",

As a child, she migrated to Australia with her family in 1843, living in Goulburn River Valley, and was educated in Melbourne, Victoria. She married Albert Alexander Cochrane Le Sou\u00ebf in 1853. Caroline would provide sketches and artworks to complement the work of Albert Le Souef during their time in the Goulburn River Valley when the treatment of Aboriginal people was conducted under a Protectorat, with Albert taking an active role. Albert and Caroline would document the customs of the local Aboriginal people during this time.\nAfter Albert was appointed foundation director of the Melbourne Zoological Gardens in 1880, the pair toured Europe, and she has a number of sketches attributed to the collection of specimens around this time. Later in life, Le Souef made a series of oil paintings depicting Aboriginal life.\nHer husband predeceased her in 1902. She died in 1915 and is buried in Melbourne General Cemetery.

    "Cetacean surfacing behaviour": "Cetacean surfacing behaviour or breaching is a group of behaviours demonstrated by the Cetacea infraorder when they come to the water's surface to breathe. Time intervals between surfacing can vary depending on the species, surfacing style or the purpose of the dive; some species have been known to dive for up to 85 minutes at a time when hunting, and dives in excess of three hours have been observed in Cuvier's beaked whale under extreme circumstances.In addition to respiration, cetaceans have developed and used surface behaviours for many other functions such as display, feeding and communication. All regularly observed members of the order Cetacea, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, show a range of surfacing behaviours. Cetacea is usually split into two suborders, Odontoceti and Mysticeti, based on the presence of teeth or baleen plates in adults respectively. However, when considering behaviour, Cetacea can be split into whales (cetaceans more than 10 m long such as sperm and most baleen whales) and dolphins and porpoises (all Odontocetes less than 10 m long including orca) as many behaviours are correlated with size. Although some behaviours such as spyhopping, logging and lobtailing occur in both groups, others such as bow riding or peduncle throws are exclusive to one or the other. It is these energetic behaviours that humans observe most frequently, which has resulted in a large amount of scientific literature on the subject and a popular tourism industry.\n\n\n== Travelling surface behaviour ==\n\n\n=== Breaching and lunging ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\nA breach or a lunge is a leap out of the water, also known as cresting. The distinction between the two is fairly arbitrary: cetacean researcher Hal Whitehead defines a breach as any leap in which at least 40% of the animal's body clears the water, and a lunge as a leap with less than 40% clearance. Qualitatively, a breach is a genuine jump with an intent to clear the water, whereas a lunge is the result of a fast upward-sloping swim that has caused the whale to clear the surface of the water unintentionally. This latter \"lunging\" behaviour is often a result of feeding in rorquals. The right, humpback, and sperm whales are the most widely observed jumpers. However other baleen whales such as fin, blue, minke, gray and sei whales also breach. Oceanic dolphins, including the orca, are very common breachers and are in fact capable of lifting themselves completely out of the water very easily, although there is little distinction between this and porpoising. Some non-cetacean marine creatures also exhibit breaching behavior, such as several shark species and rays of the genera Manta and Mobula.Two techniques are used by cetaceans in order to breach. The first method, most common in sperm and humpback whales, is conducted by swimming vertically upwards from depth, and heading straight out of the water. The other more common method is to travel close to the surface and parallel to it, and then jerk upwards at full speed with as few as 3 tail strokes to perform a breach. In all breaches the cetacean clears the water with the majority of its body at an acute angle, such as an average of 30\u00b0 to the horizontal as recorded in sperm whales. The whale then turns to land on its back or side, and less frequently may not turn but \"belly flop\" instead. In order to achieve 90% clearance, a humpback needs to leave the water at a speed of eight metres per second or 29 kilometres per hour (18 mph). For a 36 metric tons (40 short tons) animal, this results in a momentum of 288 thousand newton seconds. Despite its energetic cost, breaching is often carried out in series. The longest recorded sustained series was by a humpback near the West Indies totaling 130 leaps in less than 90 minutes. Repeated breaches tire the animal, so less of the body clears the water each time.Ultimately, the reasons for breaching are unknown; however, there is evidence to support a range of hypotheses. Whales are more likely to breach when they are in groups, suggesting that it is a non-verbal signal to other group members during social behaviour. Scientists have called this theory \"honest signalling\". The immense cloud of bubbles and underwater disturbance following a breach cannot be faked; neighbours then know a breach has taken place. A single breach costs a whale only about 0.075% of its total daily energy intake, but a long series of breaches may add up to a significant energy expenditure. A breach is therefore a sign that the animal is physically fit enough to afford energy for this acrobatic display, hence it could be used for ascertaining dominance, courting or warning of danger. It is also possible that the loud \"smack\" upon re-entering is useful for stunning or scaring prey, similar to lobtailing. As breaching is often seen in rough seas it is possible that a breach allows the whale to breathe in air that is not close to the surface and full of spray, or that they use breaching to communicate when the noise of the ocean would mask acoustic signals. Another widely accepted possible reason is to dislodge parasites from the skin. The behaviour may also be more simply a form of play.\n\n\n=== Porpoising ===\n\n\t\t\nPorpoising, also known as running, is a high speed surface behaviour of small cetaceans where long jumps are alternated with swimming close to the surface. Despite the name, porpoising behaviour is seen in dolphins and porpoises, as well as other marine species such as penguins and pinnipeds. When marine mammals are travelling at speed they are forced to stay close to the surface in order to maintain respiration for the energetic exercise. At leisurely cruising speeds below 4.6 m/s, dolphins swim below the water's surface and only briefly expose their blowholes along with up to one third of their body at any one time. This results in little splashing as they have a very streamlined shape. Porpoising occurs mainly when dolphins and porpoises are swimming at speeds greater than 4.6 m/s. Here, jump length is roughly equal to distance traveled when the cetaceans are submerged. This exposes the blowhole for longer which is needed to get enough oxygen to maintain metabolism and therefore high speeds over long periods of time. Studies have also shown that leaping is more energetically efficient than swimming above a certain threshold speed. This is due to the reduction in friction when travelling in air compared to water which saves more energy than is needed to produce the leap. These benefits also outweigh the energy wasted due to the large amount of splashing often seen when groups are porpoising. Porpoising is therefore a result of high speed swimming which cetaceans use for important pursuit and escape activities. For example, dolphins may be seen porpoising away from their main predator, sharks or the direction of incoming boats to avoid collision.Although porpoising is a useful product of rapid swimming, much variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the spinner dolphin leads to much splashing and is more common at slower speeds so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore more likely to be a form of play or communication within or between pods. Another reason might be to remove barnacles or small sharks such as remoras that, when attached, increase drag during swimming. When spinner dolphins impact the water the combination of centrifugal and vertical force upon these ectoparasites can be up to 700 times their own weight and so efficiently remove them. Other theories suggest that cetaceans may porpoise in order to observe distant objects such as food by looking for visual cues, such as birds dive-bombing a bait ball. Research into the additional functions of porpoising has so far been focussed on the more acrobatic species, but it is likely that other cetaceans also use it for these, and perhaps unknown, reasons too.\n\n\n=== Wave or bow-riding and following vessels ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe term wave-riding is most commonly used to describe the surface activity of cetaceans that approach boats and jump repeatedly in the waves produced by the boats. This includes bow-riding, where cetaceans are in the pressure wave in front of the boat, and wake-riding, where they are off the stern in the wake. Cetaceans swim using fluke propulsion when experiencing wave energy below the threshold needed for riding, such as when boats travel at speeds slower than 3 m/s or when they are outside of the peak wave energy zone. However, at higher speeds dolphins and porpoises will seek out the pressure wave and its maximum energy zone in order to ride the wave by holding their flukes in a fixed plane, with only minor adjustments for repositioning. Wave-riding reduces the energetic cost of swimming to the dolphin, even when compared to slower swimming speeds. For example, heart rate, metabolic rate and transport cost was reduced by up to 70% during wave-riding compared to swimming at speeds 1 m/s slower in bottlenose dolphin. Wave-riding behaviour can be performed by dolphins from minutes up to several hours, and therefore is a useful energy-saving mechanism for swimming at higher speeds.\nWave-riding is most common in small Odontocetes. It has also been observed in larger cetaceans such as false killer whales and orca, although most larger Odontocetes do not seek out any form of interaction with boats. Bow-riding is the most common form of interactive behaviour with boats across a variety of smaller Odontocete species, such as dolphins in the genera Stenella and Delphinus. The type of interaction can often depend on the behavioral state of the group as well as species. For example, spotted dolphins are more likely to interact when travelling or milling but less likely when they are socialising or surface feeding. Interactive behavior may also depend on group composition, as both orca and bottlenose dolphins have been recorded to interact mostly when a calf was in the group. This indicates that groups with calves may approach boats in order to teach the young how to interact safely to avoid collision. Another result of cetaceans traveling in pods is an increase in competition for the optimal wave energy and so maximum energy saving position. Position of individuals may reflect the dominance hierarchy of the pod and therefore could be used to ascertain dominance. Several rorquals, such as minke, sei, bryde's, humpback, and gray are also known to display actions in similar manners.\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\nJumping dolphins\n\n\n== Stationary surface behaviour ==\n\n\n=== Spyhopping ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhen spyhopping, the whale rises and holds a vertical position partially out of the water, often exposing its entire rostrum and head. It is visually akin to a human treading water. Spyhopping is controlled and slow, and can last for minutes at a time if the whale is sufficiently inquisitive about whatever it is viewing. Generally, the whale does not appear to swim by fluke propulsion to maintain its \"elevated\" position while spyhopping, instead relying on exceptional buoyancy control and positioning with pectoral fins. Typically the whale's eyes will be slightly above or below the surface of the water, enabling it to see whatever is nearby on the surface. The great white shark and oceanic whitetip shark have also been known to spyhop.Spyhopping often occurs during a \"mugging\" situation, where the focus of a whale's attention is on a boat, such as whale-watching tours, which they sometimes approach and interact with. On the other hand, spyhopping among orcas is thought to be for predation reasons, as they are often seen around ice floes in order to view if prey species such as seals are resting on them. When prey is detected the individual will conduct a series of spy-hops from different locations around it, then vocalise to the group members to do the same to possibly prepare for an attack. In this instance a spyhop may be more useful than a breach, because the view is held steady for a longer period of time. Often when cetaceans breach, their eyes do not clear the water, which suggests it might not be used for looking but instead for hearing. For example, gray whales will often spy-hop in order to hear better when they are near the line where waves begin to break in the ocean as this marks out their migration route. It can therefore be said that spy-hopping behaviour is used for many different reasons across a wide range of species.\n\n\n=== Lobtailing and slapping ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nLobtailing is the act of a whale or dolphin lifting its fluke out of the water and then bringing them down onto the surface of the water hard and fast in order to make a loud slap. Large whales tend to lobtail by positioning themselves vertically downwards into the water and then slapping the surface by bending the tail stock. Dolphins, however, tend to remain horizontal, either on their belly or their back, and make the slap via a jerky whole body movement. All species are likely to slap several times in a single session. Like breaching, lobtailing is common amongst active cetacean species such as sperm, humpback, right and grey whales. It is less common, but still occasionally occurs, amongst the other large whales. Porpoises and river dolphins rarely lobtail, but it is a very common phenomenon amongst oceanic dolphins. Lobtailing is more common within species that have a complex social order than those where animals are more likely to be solitary. Lobtailing often occurs in conjunction with other aerial behaviour such as breaching. Species with large flippers may also slap them against the water for a similar effect, known as pectoral slapping.\nThe sound of a lobtail can be heard underwater several hundred metres from the site of a slap. This has led to speculation amongst scientists that lobtailing is, like breaching, a form of non-vocal communication. However, studies of bowhead whales have shown that the noise of a lobtail travels much less well than that of a vocal call or a breach. Thus the lobtail is probably important visually as well as acoustically, and may be a sign of aggression. Some suggest that lobtailing in humpback whales is a means of foraging. The hypothesis is that the loud noise causes fish to become frightened, thus tightening their school together, making it easier for the humpback to feed on them. In this instance, lobtail feeding behaviour appeared to progressively spread throughout the population, as it increased from 0 to 50% of the population using it over the 9-year study. As no individual under 2 years old nor any mothers were observed to use lobtail feeding it suggests that it is taught in foraging groups. The spread of lobtail feeding amongst humpback whales indicates its success as a novel foraging method.\n\n\n==== Gallery ====\nWhales with raised tail on Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n=== Peduncle throw ===\nA peduncle throw, also known as peduncling, is a surfacing behaviour unique to humpback whales. During this the humpback converts its forward momentum into a crack-the-whip rotation, pivoting with its pectorals as it drives its head downward and thrusts its entire fluke and peduncle (the muscular rear portion of the torso) out of the water and sideways, before crashing into the water with terrific force. Peduncling takes place among the focal animals (female, escort, challenging male) in a competitive group, apparently as an aggressive gesture. Possibilities include escorts fending off a particular challenging male, females who seem agitated with an escort, or an individual not comfortable with a watching boat's presence. Occasionally, one whale performs a series of dozens of peduncle throws, directed at the same target each time.\n\n\n=== Pectoral slapping ===\n\n\t\t\nPectoral slapping, informally known as pec-slapping, is when a cetacean turns on its side, exposes one or both pectoral fins into the air, and then slaps them against the surface of the water. It is a form of non-vocal communication commonly observed in a variety of whale and dolphin species as well as seals. The motion is slow and controlled, and the behaviour can occur repeatedly by one individual over a few minutes. The humpback whale's pectoral fin is the largest appendage of any mammal and humpbacks are known for their extremely acrobatic behaviour. Pec-slapping varies between groups of different social structure, such as not occurring in lone males but being common in mother calf pairs and also when they are accompanied by an escort. The reasons for pec-slapping therefore can vary depending on age and sex of individual humpback whales. During the breeding season adult males pec-slap before they disassociate with a group of males that are vying for a female, whereas adult females pec-slap to attract potential mates and indicate that she is sexually receptive. Its function between mother calf pairs is less well known but is likely to be a form of play and communication that is taught to the calf by the mother for use when it is sexually mature. Pectoral slapping has also been observed in the right whale, but due to its smaller size, the sound produced will be quieter and therefore used for communication over smaller distances unlike the humpback. Exposure of the pectoral fin and consequent slapping has also been infrequently observed in blue whales, where it is most often a by-product of lunge feeding followed by rolling on to its side.\n\n\n=== Logging ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nLogging is a behaviour that whales exhibit when at rest and appear like \"logs\" at the surface. It is defined as lying without forward movement at the surface of the water with the dorsal fin or parts of the back are exposed. Whales often rest for periods of time under the surface in order to sleep in mainly horizontal positions, although sperm whales also rest vertically. However, as they consciously need to breathe at the surface, they can rest only one-half of their brain at a time, known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep. This sleep pattern has been identified in all five cetacean species that have been tested for it thus far. Cetaceans intermittently come to the surface in order to breathe during these sleep periods and exhibit logging behaviour. Logging can occur interchangeably with surface resting behaviour when cetaceans are travelling slowly, which is particularly common in mother-calf pairs, as the young tire quickly during swimming. Logging is common, particularly in right whales, sperm whales, pilot whales and humpback whales. Another behaviour that may be mistaken for logging is milling, where a group of cetaceans at the surface have little or no directional movement but instead socialise with each other. This behaviour is particularly common in large groups of pilot whales.\n\n\n== Human interaction ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhale watching is carried out on every continent, with an estimated 13 million people participating in 2008. This, when combined with the sustained increase in boat vessel traffic, has likely affected the surface activity of cetaceans. When boats and other whale watching vessels approach, most cetaceans will either avoid or seek interactions. The occasions where no effect is seen is predominantly when the cetaceans are travelling or feeding, but not when they are showing surface activity. In the case of avoidance, the animals may dive rather than staying submerged near the surface or move horizontally away from the vessels. For example, when sperm whales are approached by boats they surface less, shorten the intervals between breathes and do not show their fluke before diving as often. Cetaceans may also reduce their acrobatic surfacing behaviours, such as when humpback whale groups without calves are approached by vessels to within 300 m. Avoidance behaviour is typical of whales, but interactions are more common in whale groups that contain calves and also in the smaller Odontocetes. For example, studies on killer whales in North America have shown that the focal animals increased their tail-slapping behaviour when approached by boats within 100 m, and that 70% of surface active behaviours (SABs) in these orca were seen when a boat was within 225 m. Similarly, dusky dolphins also jump, change direction and form tighter groups more when boats are present, particularly when they do not adhere to the regulations about approach. As an increase in SABs is beneficial to the whale watching tours\u2019 participants, the tours may be encouraged to approach cetaceans closer than recommended by guidelines. There is a lack of understanding about the long-term effects of whale-watching on the behaviour of cetaceans, but it is theorised that it may cause avoidance of popular sites, or a decrease in the energy budget for individuals involved.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBeached whale\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nW\u00fcrsig, B.; Dorsey, E.M.; Richardson, W.J.; Wells, R.S.

The Washington Grove Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding ===\nA group of Methodists began the tradition of having camp meetings in the area circa 1800. Camp meetings were a tradition where a group of Methodists would gather in a forest clearing to worship and socialize. Benches were arranged in a circle or oval with an elevated preachers' stand in the middle. Tents surrounded the area, along with carriages and wagons behind them. Services lasted well into the night. The camp meetings provided cultural and spiritual improvement to those who attended.In 1873, a committee from the Foundry Methodist Church, located at 14th and G streets NW in Washington, D.C., began a search for a permanent location to hold annual camp meetings. They wanted a location with sufficient space for thousands of attendees, a supply of clean water, and a shaded location to provide relief from the summer sun. They wanted the location to be less than a day's trip from Washington, D.C., and protection from the sale of liquor, because Methodists did not believe in drinking alcohol.In June 1873, John T. Mitchell, Richard Willett, F. Howard, W.R. Woodward, E.F. Simpson, Mr. Worthington, Thomas P. Morgan, B. Peyton Brown, and a few others purchased 267.5 acres (1.1 km2) of land from the widow of farmer Nathan Cooke for $6,636.25. The land was given to the Washington Grove Meeting Association, which had been recently incorporated on March 30, 1874.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nA person could build a cottage on the land by purchasing five shares of stock for twenty dollars per share. The first share had to be purchased with cash, while the other four could be financed at an annual interest rate of six percent. Alternatively, a tent could be rented for between $9 and $15. There were two dining courts, and a market would provided fresh meat and produce. The center of the camp was originally named The Plaza and later The Symbolic Circle, and there were six numbered avenues radiating from it. Tents were arranged in a grid along avenues named for participating churches. Families would stay over to attend a two-week-long meeting of the Methodist Episcopal churches of the District of Columbia. Named Washington Grove Camp, the first camp meeting began on August 5, 1874, with 240 tents.In 1877, a tabernacle with a belfry for a bell was built in the center of the circle. The bell called people to prayer, and it was also rung at the end of the camp meeting. The tabernacle was a large open-air chapel that could seat 500 worshipers. In addition to religious services, lecturers spoke on such topics as women's suffrage and the problem of poverty in cities.The Maryland legislature gave camp-meeting managers control of all land within a two-mile radius of a meeting site in order to prohibit businesses from opening nearby. The camp-meeting managers used this power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages anywhere on the grounds. While entertaining programs were allowed, card playing, theater going, and dancing were all banned. In 1879, they voted to prohibit the selling of anything at all on Sundays. The Barrett Brothers, who operated the camp store, asked for an exception to sell ice cream and sandwiches on Sundays, but their request was denied.Reverend William Burns of Dumbarton Methodist Church built the first cottage in 1878. By 1879, seventeen cottages had been built, each with green and white exteriors and large porches, surrounding a large tabernacle. The cottages peaked roofs resembled that of the original tents, and the architectural style was Carpenter Gothic, which was fashionable at the time. The round-trip train fare between the District and Washington Grove was eighty cents in 1879.In 1879, the trustees voted to borrow $4,000 in order to build a hotel on the western area of the grounds. Completed in 1881, the hotel was three stories in the center and two stories in the wings. It had 23 sleeping rooms, a parlor, a dining room, and a kitchen. The cost to build the hotel came in under the $4,000 budget. Building of a chapel to hold 800 people began in 1889.In 1880, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association decided that a hotel was needed. To build the hotel, they chose Wash Williams, a furniture store owner. The Albany Hotel had big porches, a large dining room, a barber shop, and a small store. Rooms cost between $6 and $7 per week, and dinner cost fifty cents. During the same year, rules were established protecting existing trees when cottages and streets were built.In order to accommodate larger groups of people, an auditorium with seating for 1,400 people was built in Woodward Park in 1905. The auditorium symbolically moved away from the Sacred Circle. Admission to the wholesome entertainment cost $2 per adult and $1 per child for the season. Some of the entertainment included musical programs, educational lectures, and spelling bees. Religious services were held at the auditorium as well.  As the auditorium increasingly became the center of life at the camp, the old Tabernacle was torn down.Because the land was owned by the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association, it had complete control over who purchased and leased the plots. In the early 20th century, the Washington Grove Camp Association, and later the Town of Washington Grove, placed restrictive covenants in deeds and leases in order to prevent African Americans from buying, renting, or leasing land in Washington Grove.  This is exemplified in one of many deeds, such as one dating from 1925 that reads,\n\nThat whereas the death rate of persons of African descent is much greater than the death rate of persons of the white race and affects injuriously the health of the town and village communities, and as the permanent location of persons of African descent in such places as owners or tenants constitutes and irreparable injury to the value and usefulness of real estate in the interest of public health and to prevent irreparable injury to the grantor or its successors and assigns, and the owners of adjacent real estate, the grantees, their heirs and assigns, hereby covenant, and agree with the grantor, its successors and assigns, that they will not sell, conveyor rent the premises hereby conveyed, the whole or any part thereof, or any structure thereon, to any person of African descent.\nA Black Methodist camp was founded in 1864 as Emory Grove, that predated Washington Grove. Less than a mile separated the two towns, and many of the residents of Emory Grove worked for the residents of Washington Grove. The superintendent of the Washington Grove grounds was a resident of Emory Grove named William A. Scott. Following an incident in 1892 where an Emory Grove native, Jessie Lancaster, ransacked homes in Washington Grove, William A. Scott was forced out. Subsequently, in 1897 the gates to Washington Grove were closed, thus preventing anyone from walking through Washington Grove. This closing severely hindered the ability of Emory Grove residents to reach the train stop on the other side of Washington Grove.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nEventually, people began to live in the area year-round. In 1910, the church formed a year-round congregation. By the 1920s, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association began selling portions of land, slowly replacing the 99-year leases. By 1924, camp meetings were no longer held.The Great Depression affected the area significantly. The Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association had a difficult time paying its bills, it cut back on its insurance, and at one point it needed a donation to pay the community's electricity bill. Because some residents could no longer afford vacation homes, some of the homes were rented out while others stood vacant and neglected.By 1934, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association recognized that the area had dramatically changed since its founding. Some residents wanted the area to be annexed to the town of Gaithersburg. Reorganization committees met for several years to determine a plan for the future of the community. In 1937, the Washington Grove Camp Meeting Association was dissolved; the Maryland Legislature incorporated the community as a town on March 26, 1937. Maryland Governor Harry Nice signed the town's charter into law on May 18, 1937. On July 10, 1937, the town held an election where it chose its first mayor and six members of the town council. Irving L. McCathran was elected the town's first mayor. He served as mayor for twenty years.By the late 1940s, Washington Grove began to look run down. Assembly Hall was in poor condition, the parks were unkempt, and many cottages so dilapidated that they were torn down. There was too little money to maintain the Auditorium, and it was demolished. The surrounding farms in Gaithersburg were beginning to be sold to developers, changing the surrounding area and putting pressure on the town to change dramatically. In 1955, the Town of Washington Grove obtained zoning and planning powers in order to control future growth.In 1975, a master plan was written in order to retain the existing historic nature of the town. The town applied for National Register of Historic Places status in 1979, and it was approved the following year.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nThe original layout of small houses fronting grassy walkways was preserved in the center of town, with vehicular access via paved streets leading to the backs of the houses. Houses built more recently do not front the walkways, but preserve a Grove flavor by the variety of architectural styles resulting from their being constructed one at a time in various styles rather than in tracts.\nMore than half of the town is publicly owned. The East Woods and West Woods, designated as wildlife sanctuaries, are the only municipality-owned forests in Maryland. The many walkways and parks are popular not only with residents but also with people from neighboring communities. On a fine evening, the walkways hum with people and cats strolling, walking dogs, and chatting. Residents meet for musical picnics at the Gazebo, town meetings in McCathran Hall, and summer days swimming in Maple Lake, the Town's swimming hole in the West Woods. Other town activities include the Summer in the Parks program for children, a book club, a movie club, and the Mousetrap series of concerts.\nIn 2013, Preservation Maryland placed Washington Grove on its list of threatened historic properties.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nWashington Grove is located at 39\u00b08\u203222\u2033N 77\u00b010\u203233\u2033W (39.139535, -77.175926).According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.35 square miles (0.91 km2), all land.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 555 people, 230 households, and 157 families residing in the town.

Males had a median income of $70,750 versus $48,125 for females. The per capita income for the town was $38,332. None of the families and 0.8% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no one under eighteen and no one over 64.\n\n\n== Government ==\nWashington Grove is governed by a Council of citizens consisting of 6 elected Councilors and a Mayor. Elections are held yearly in May, with two councilor positions rotating for election each year. Two Council meetings are held each month. Town residents are encouraged to attend, and in one of the two monthly meetings a period of time is set aside for \"Public Appearances\" in which issues are aired and discussed by Town residents urging some action by the Council. There is a Town Meeting yearly in which Town Residents examine and approve (or ask for changes to) the coming fiscal year's budget. When issues of significant importance are pending, a Special Town Meeting is often called to allow for an exchange of ideas.\nMost of the work in keeping the Town running, however, is performed by volunteers in the many committees including the Woods Group, the Recreation Committee, the Lake Committee, the Historic Preservation Committee, and many others. Volunteerism is high, allowing an extraordinarily broad range of activities and events.\nEach Councilor is liaison to (typically) two Town Committees, with responsibilities to attend meetings of those committees and report back on their activities. Individual Councilors are also responsible for administration of contracts for road maintenance, trash and recycling pickup, tree maintenance, and other ongoing upkeep efforts.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is zoned to schools in the Montgomery County Public Schools district.\nZoned schools include:\n\nWashington Grove Elementary School\nForest Oak Middle School\nGaithersburg High School\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nNo state highways traverse the town, with the primary road through town being county-maintained Washington Grove Lane. However, major highways are located in the vicinity, including Interstate 370, Interstate 270, and Maryland Route 200.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMousetrap Concert Series\nWashington Grove Flickr Group\nWashington Grove, Montgomery County, including photo in 1974, at Maryland Historical Trust\nBoundary Map of the Washington Grove Historic District, Montgomery County, at Maryland Historical Trust",

    "Dandenong Market": "Dandenong Market is a major-regional market located in the heart of Dandenong, Victoria in the South East of Melbourne, at the corner of Clow and Cleeland Streets. Dandenong Market is one of Melbourne's oldest markets, established in 1866, and is one of Australia's largest, with over 200 market traders  spread over 8000 square metres  and attracting over 5 million visitors a year. It is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the Melbourne CBD.Dandenong's market has long served as an important focus for the area.  The market, originally located at Lonsdale and McCrae Streets, was relocated to its current location in 1926.  As a part of state redevelopment efforts in the City of Greater Dandenong, the market received a $26 million refurbishment completed in 2011.Dandenong Market is primarily known as a home to 150 nationalities, and its traditional market atmosphere. The market is home to both stalls and shops selling fresh fruit and veg, seafood and meat, deli items, bakeries, and florists. The market also has a large general merchandise area, \"The Bazaar\" featuring 120 traders selling clothing, jewellery, toys, homewares and computer equipment.\nDandenong Market is also known for popular events and festivals, including Dandenong World Fare which attracts over 35,000 visitors, the Full Moon festival and Diwali.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was in the late 1840s that the first permanent dwelling was established in future township of Dandenong. The town on the Dandenong Creek grew rapidly and, in 1863, citizens from the recently established Dandenong Improvement petitioned the government for approval to establish a public market in their growing town.The first market day was Tuesday, 10 October 1866. An early advertisement stated that for sale would be: \"A choice lot of dairy cows, with calves; heifers springing, 50 head store cattle, a quantity of useful horses, fat and store pigs, well-bread rams,  poultry, potatoes, and other produce; drays, spring-cart and farming implements, &c.\" It also noted \"Lunch will be provided.\"At first held fortnightly, the market was soon a weekly event.  By 1870, the market had up to 300 vendors and buyers in attendance. Auctioneers sold livestock, fruit, dairy products, skins, lard, honey, hay and other farm produce.  Farmers from throughout the La Trobe Valley and Gippsland travelled to Dandenong to buy and sell. One Gippsland farmer later recalled the difficulties of travelling by road. 'After some years, we commenced carting our butter, eggs and bacon to the Dandenong market. The roads were still very bad; the journey always took three strenuous days.' \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

    "Kendra's Law": "Kendra's Law, effective since November 1999, is a New York State law concerning involuntary outpatient commitment also known as assisted outpatient treatment. It grants judges the authority to issue orders that require people who meet certain criteria to regularly undergo psychiatric treatment. Failure to comply could result in commitment for up to 72 hours.  Kendra's Law does not mandate that patients be forced to take medication.\nIt was originally proposed by members of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the Alliance on Mental Illness of New York State, and many local NAMI chapters throughout the state. They were concerned that laws were preventing individuals with serious mental illness from receiving care until after they became \"dangerous to self or others\". They viewed outpatient commitment as a less expensive, less restrictive and more humane alternative to inpatient commitment.\nThe members of NAMI, working with NYS Assemblywoman Elizabeth Connelly, NYC Department of Mental Health Commissioner Luis Marcos, and Howard Telson were successful in getting a three-year pilot commitment program started at Bellevue Hospital. When the Bellevue Outpatient Commitment Program came to an end, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the Treatment Advocacy Center and DJ Jaffe put together a coalition to pass a statewide law. It was based on the same concept as the Bellevue Outpatient Commitment Program but with important differences.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1999, there was a series of incidents involving individuals with untreated mental illness becoming violent. In one assault in the New York City Subway, Andrew Goldstein,  29 and diagnosed with schizophrenia but off medication, pushed Kendra Webdale into the path of an oncoming N train at the 23rd Street station. Goldstein had recently attempted to get treatment but had been turned away. Webdale's family joined a coalition led by Governor Pataki, the Treatment Advocacy Center and Jaffe, and the family played a significant role in getting the law passed. Subsequently, in a similar incident, Julio Perez, age 43, pushed Edgar Rivera in front of an uptown 6 train at 51st Street. Rivera lost his legs and became a strong supporter of the law.  Kendra's Law, introduced by Pataki, was created as a response to these incidents. In 2005, the law was extended for five years.As a result of these incidents, involuntary outpatient commitment moved from being seen as a program to help people with mental illness to a program that could increase public safety. Public safety advocates joined in trying to take the Bellevue Pilot Program statewide. What was formerly known as involuntary outpatient commitment was re-named euphemistically as \"assisted outpatient treatment\", in an attempt to imply a positive intent of the law.\n\n\n== Criteria ==\nKendra's Law allows courts to order certain people diagnosed with mental illness to attend treatment as a condition for living in the community. The law is aimed at those who have a pattern of not following treatment recommendations which has resulted in re-hospitalization, or violent behaviors placing the patient or others as serious risk of physical harm.In order to be admitted to Kendra's Law, individuals must meet the following criteria established in Section 9.60 of NYS Mental Health Law. A patient may be ordered to obtain assisted outpatient treatment if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:\n\nthe patient is eighteen years of age or older; and\nthe patient is suffering from a mental illness; and\nthe patient is unlikely to survive safely in the community without supervision, based on a clinical determination; and\nthe patient has a history of lack of compliance with treatment for mental illness that has:\nat least twice within the last thirty-six months been a significant factor in necessitating hospitalization in a hospital, or receipt of services in a forensic or other mental health unit of a correctional facility or a local correctional facility, not including any period during which the person was hospitalized or incarcerated immediately preceding the filing of the petition or;\nresulted in one or more acts of serious violent behavior toward self or others or threats of, or attempts at, serious physical harm to self or others within the last forty-eight months, not including any period in which the person was hospitalized or incarcerated immediately preceding the filing of the petition; and\nthe patient is, as a result of his or her mental illness, unlikely to voluntarily participate in the recommended treatment pursuant to the treatment plan; and\nin view of the patient's treatment history and current behavior, the patient is in need of assisted outpatient treatment in order to prevent a relapse or deterioration which would be likely to result in serious harm to the patient or others as defined in section 9.01 of this article; and\nit is likely that the patient will benefit from assisted outpatient treatment; and\nif the patient has executed a health care proxy as defined in article 29-C of the public health law, that any directions included in such proxy shall be taken into account by the court in determining the written treatment plan; and\nthe treatment plan set forth is the least restrictive plan that is most likely to benefit the patient.A patient can only be ordered to assisted outpatient treatment for a maximum 12-month period.  The assisted outpatient treatment may be renewed by petition filed prior to the current order's expiration.  Where the petition is for a renewal, the 36-month limit for re-hospitalizations and the 48-month limit for violent behavior do not apply.\n\n\n== Support ==\nThe New York Times reported that \"a study has found that a controversial program that orders these patients to receive treatment when they are not hospitalized has had positive results. Patients were much less likely to end up back in psychiatric hospitals and were arrested less often. Use of outpatient treatment significantly increased, as did refills of medication. Costs to the mental health system and Medicaid of caring for these patients dropped by half or more.\"According to the Treatment Advocacy Center, the following organizations (in part or in full) support the law:\n\n\n=== National ===\nTreatment Advocacy Center (TAC)\nAmerican Psychiatric Nurses Association\nAmerican Psychiatric Association\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)\nNational Sheriffs Association\nNational Crime Prevention Council\n\n\n=== Statewide ===\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness New York State (NAMI NYS)\nNYS Association of Chiefs of Police (NYSCOP)\n\n\n=== Regional and local ===\nAMI-Friends of NYS Psychiatric Institute, NYC\nNAMI/Familya of Rockland County\nNAMI Schenectady\nNAMI Chautauqua County\nNAMI of Buffalo and Erie County\nNAMI of NYC/Staten Island\nNAMI Orange County\nNAMI Champlain Valley\nHarlem Alliance for the Mentally Ill\nNAMI of Montgomery, Fulton, Hamilton Counties\nNAMI/Albany Relatives\nNAMI North Country\nAlbany County Forensic Task Force\nWestchester County Chiefs of Police Association\nOrange County Police Chiefs Association\nTown of New Windsor, police department\nTown of Chester, NY Police Department\nTown of Mechanicville, police department\nWest Seneca, NY Police Department\nBroome County District Attorney\n\n\n=== Selected individual supporters ===\nXavier Amador \u2013 author, I am Not Sick, I Don't Need Help!\nPete Early \u2013 author, Crazy: A Father's Search Through America's Mental Health Madness\nRael Jean Isaac \u2013 co-author, Madness in the Streets\nRichard Lamb \u2013 Dept. of Psychiatry, USC\nEdgar Rivera \u2013 lost legs in subway pushing\nE.

It shows that those who support Kendra's Law say it helps them get well and stay well. Research in other states that have assisted outpatient treatment programs have also shown positive results.Courts have ruled that Kendra's Law does not violate rights, citing the narrow criteria, the fact that the law does not provide for medication over objection (\"force\") and the government interest in reducing violence.Supporters note that the system in the United States is so different from that in the U.K. that studies that aggregate community treatment orders (CTOs) used in the U.K. and elsewhere overseas with Kendra's Law as practiced in the U.S. do not give as accurate a picture as studies exclusively on Kendra's Law. They note that the Cochrane Study quoted by opponents of assisted outpatient treatment did not include any of the studies on Kendra's Law, or assisted outpatient treatment as practiced in other states, and only included a pilot program, the Bellevue Outpatient Commitment Program, that was never taken statewide.\nIn addition, the New York Times reported on Kendra's Law: the \"program that orders these patients to receive treatment when they are not hospitalized has had positive results. Patients were much less likely to end up back in psychiatric hospitals and were arrested less often. Use of outpatient treatment significantly increased, as did refills of medication. Costs to the mental health system and Medicaid of caring for these patients dropped by half or more.\"\n\n\n== Opposition ==\nKendra's Law is opposed for different reasons by many groups, most notably the anti-psychiatry movement and the New York Civil Liberties Union. Opponents say that the law has harmed the mental health system, because it can deter people from seeking treatment. The implementation of the law is also criticized as being racially and socioeconomically biased.\n\n\n== Studies ==\nA 2017 Cochrane systematic review of the literature, that included three relatively small randomized controlled trials, did not find significant differences in the use of services, social functioning, or quality of life when comparing compulsory community treatment with standard voluntary care or brief supervised discharge. The systematic review did report that people who receive compulsory community treatment may be less likely to be victims of crime, both violent and non-violent.A randomized, controlled trial published in the Lancet concluded, \"the imposition of compulsory supervision does not reduce the rate of readmission of psychotic patients. We found no support in terms of any reduction in overall hospital admission to justify the significant curtailment of patients' personal liberty.\"\nOf 442 patients assessed, 336 patients were randomly assigned to be discharged from hospital either on CTO (167 patients) or Section 17 leave (169 patients). One patient withdrew directly after randomisation and two were ineligible, giving a total sample of 333 patients (166 in the CTO group and 167 in the Section 17 group). At 12 months, despite the fact that the length of initial compulsory outpatient treatment differed significantly between the two groups (median 183 days CTO group vs 8 days Section 17 group, p<0\u00b7001) the number of patients readmitted did not differ between groups (59 [36%] of 166 patients in the CTO group vs 60 [36%] of 167 patients in the Section 17 group; adjusted relative risk 1\u00b70 [95% CI 0\u00b775\u20141\u00b733]).\nA 2005 study, \"Kendra's Law: A Final Report on the Status of Assisted Outpatient Treatment\", done by New York State's Office of Mental Health, concluded, \"Over a three year period prior to their AOT order, almost all (97%) had been hospitalized (with an average of three hospitalizations per recipient), and many experienced homelessness, arrest, and incarceration. During participation in the AOT program, rates for hospitalizations, homelessness, arrests, and incarcerations have declined significantly, and program participants have experienced a lessening of the stress associated with these events.\"The same study found that 55% fewer recipients engaged in suicide attempts or physical harm to self; 47% fewer physically harmed others; 46% fewer damaged or destroyed property; 43% fewer threatened physical harm to others and the average decrease in harmful behaviors was 44%. 74% fewer participants experienced homelessness; 77% fewer experienced psychiatric hospitalization; there was a 56% reduction in length of hospitalization; 83% fewer experienced arrest; 87% fewer experienced incarceration; 49% fewer abused alcohol and 48% fewer abused drugs. The number of individuals exhibiting good adherence to medications increased 51%; The number of individuals exhibiting good service engagement increased 103%.\nThe study found that of those subjects included in the sample, 75% reported that AOT helped them gain control over their lives; 81% said AOT helped them get and stay well; 90% said AOT made them more likely to keep appointments and take medications; 87% of participants said they were confident in their case manager's ability, and 88% said they and their case manager agreed on the issues to be addressed.\nThe study reported the following effects on the mental health system. \"Improved access to services. AOT has been instrumental in increasing accountability at all system levels regarding delivery of services to high need individuals. Community awareness of AOT has resulted in increased outreach to individuals who had previously presented engagement challenges to mental health service providers.\" \"Improved treatment plan development, discharge planning, and coordination of service planning. Processes and structures developed for AOT have resulted in improvements to treatment plans that more appropriately match the needs of individuals who have had difficulties using mental health services in the past.\" \"Improved collaboration between mental health and court systems. As AOT processes have matured, professionals from the two systems have improved their working relationships, resulting in greater efficiencies, and ultimately, the conservation of judicial, clinical, and administrative resources.\" \"There is now an organized process to prioritize and monitor individuals with the greatest need ...\" AOT ensures greater access to services for individuals whom providers have previously been reluctant to serve. ...\" \"There is now increased collaboration between inpatient and community-based providers.\"\nA 2009 study, New York State Assisted Outpatient Treatment Evaluation done by Duke University, Policy Research Associates, University of Virginia, concluded that New York State's program had the following effects on the mental health system:  improves a range of important outcomes for its recipients, apparently without feared negative consequences to recipients. The increased services available under AOT clearly improve recipient outcomes, however, the AOT court order, itself, and its monitoring do appear to offer additional benefits in improving outcomes. It is also important to recognize that the AOT order exerts a critical effect on service providers stimulating their efforts to prioritize care for AOT recipients.\nThe authors said that the evaluation reflected not just the compulsory aspects of the program, but the additional resources provided for recipients, particularly in New York City.The same study found \"No evidence that the AOT Program is disproportionately selecting African Americans for court orders, nor is there evidence of a disproportionate effect on other minority populations. Our interviews with key stakeholders across the state corroborate these findings.\" \"AOT order exerts a critical effect on service providers stimulating their efforts to prioritize care for AOT recipients.\" \"After 12 months or more on AOT, service engagement increased such that AOT recipients were judged to be more engaged than voluntary patients. This suggests that after 12 months or more, when combined with intensive services, AOT increases service engagement compared to voluntary treatment alone.\" \"Despite being under a court order to participate in treatment, current AOT recipients feel neither more positive nor more negative about their treatment experiences than comparable individuals who are not under AOT.\"One study found that Kendra's Law has lowered the risk of violent behaviors, reduced thoughts about suicide, and enhanced capacity to function despite problems with mental illness. Patients given mandatory outpatient treatment were four times less likely than members of the control group to perpetrate serious violence after undergoing treatment. Patients who underwent mandatory treatment reported higher social functioning and slightly less stigma, rebutting claims that mandatory outpatient care is a threat to self-esteem.Another study found, \"For those who received AOT, the odds of any arrest were 2.66 times greater (p<.01) and the odds of arrest for a violent offense 8.61 times greater (p<.05) before AOT than they were in the period during and shortly after AOT. The group never receiving AOT had nearly double the odds (1.91, p<.05) of arrest compared with the AOT group in the period during and shortly after assignment.\"Another study found, \"The odds of arrest for participants currently receiving AOT were nearly two-thirds lower (OR=.39, p<.01) than for individuals who had not yet initiated AOT or signed a voluntary service agreement.\"A study previously cited also found, \"The likelihood of psychiatric hospital admission was significantly reduced by approximately 25% during the initial six-month court order ... and by over one-third during a subsequent six-month renewal of the order.... Similar significant reductions in days of hospitalization were evident during initial court orders and subsequent renewals.... Improvements were also evident in receipt of psychotropic medications and intensive case management services. Analysis of data from case manager reports showed similar reductions in hospital admissions and improved engagement in services.\"A peer-reviewed study that included an analysis on the costs of assisted outpatient treatment found that in New York City net costs declined 50 percent in the first year after AOT began and an additional 13 percent in the second year. In non-NYC counties, costs declined 62 percent in the first year and an additional 27 percent in the second year. This was in spite of the fact that psychotropic drug costs increased during the first year after initiation of AOT, by 40 percent and 44 percent in the city and five-county samples, respectively. The increased community-based mental health costs were more than offset by the reduction in inpatient and incarceration costs. Cost declines associated with AOT were about twice as large as those seen for voluntary services.\nAnother study found that \"In all three regions, for all three groups, the predicted probability of a M(edication) P(ossession) R(atio) \u226580% improved over time (AOT improved by 31\u201340 percentage points, followed by enhanced services, which improved by 15\u201322 points, and 'neither treatment,' improving 8\u201319 points).\"Another peer review study on the effect of AOT on the mental health system found that \"In tandem with New York's AOT program, enhanced services increased among involuntary recipients, whereas no corresponding increase was initially seen for voluntary recipients. In the long run, however, overall service capacity was increased, and the focus on enhanced services for AOT participants appears to have led to greater access to enhanced services for both voluntary and involuntary recipients.\"Finally, a study found individuals in AOT stay in treatment after AOT ends. \"When the court order was for seven months or more, improved medication possession rates and reduced hospitalization outcomes were sustained even when the former AOT recipients were no longer receiving intensive case coordination services.\"\n\n\n=== Current status ===\nOn January 15, 2013, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law a new measure that extended Kendra's Law through 2017.Forty-seven states have adopted laws allowing for AOT.In February 2021, Governor Cuomo suggested that state lawmakers should revisit or expand Kendra's law, after New York City experienced a spate of violent attacks committed by people with untreated mental illness.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNo Involuntary Outpatient Torture \u2013 (Commitment) \u2013 WE THE PEOPLE\nMindFreedom International\nThe Law Project for Psychiatric Rights\nNationwide Organizing Call to Action: STOP forced \"mental health treatment\" \u2013 WE THE PEOPLE\nCenter for Human Rights of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry\nNational Association of Rights, Protection & Advocacy\nKendra's Law\nSummary of the law\nNYCLU stance on the Law\nMyths about Kendra's Law\nNational Mental Health Consumers' Self-Help Clearinghouse\nKendra's Law, Not Ours",

    "Hebraization of Palestinian place names": "Arabic-language place names of Palestine were replaced with Hebrew-language place names throughout different periods: under the British Mandatory Palestine regime; after the establishment of Israel following the 1948 Palestinian exodus and 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War; and subsequently in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in 1967. A 1992 study counted c.2,780 historical locations whose names were Hebraized, including 340 villages and towns, 1,000 Khirbat (ruins), 560 wadis and rivers, 380 springs, 198 mountains and hills, 50 caves, 28 castles and palaces, and 14 pools and lakes. The erasure of Palestinian geography is considered part of the Palestinian Nakba.Many of the place names surviving in the Palestinian dialect of Arabic are considered by scholars to preserve the original ancient or biblical name. In some instances of modern Hebraization, the traditional Palestinian Arabic place name was preserved in the modern Hebrew, despite there being a different Hebrew tradition regarding the name, as in the case of Banias, and where, in classical Hebrew writings, the place is called Paneas. Municipal direction sign-posts and maps produced by state-run agencies sometimes note the traditional Hebrew name and the traditional Arabic name alongside each other, such as \"Nablus / Shechem\" and \"Silwan / Shiloach\", inter alia. In certain areas of Israel, particularly mixed Jewish\u2013Arab cities, there is a growing trend to restore the original Arabic street names which were Hebraized after 1948,In 1925, the Directorate of the Jewish National Fund (JNF) established The Names Committee for the Settlements, with the intent of giving names to the new Jewish settlements established on lands purchased by the JNF. The Jewish National Council (JNC), for their part, met in parley in late 1931, in order to make its recommendations known to the British government in Mandatory Palestine, by suggesting emendations to a book published by the British colonial office in Palestine in which it outlined a set of standards used when referencing place names transliterated from Arabic and Hebrew into English, or from Arabic into Hebrew, and from Hebrew into Arabic, based on the country's ancient toponymy. Many of the same proposals made by the JNC were later implemented, beginning in 1949 (Committee for Geographical Names) and later following 1951, when Yeshayahu Press (a member of the JNC) established the Government Naming Committee.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nMany of the place names surviving in the Palestinian dialect of Arabic can be traced to Aramaic, the major language spoken  by the predominantly Christian peasantry in that region at the time of the advent of Islam.C. R. Conder (1848\u20131910) of the Palestine Exploration Fund was among the first to recognize the importance of analyzing Arabic place names in order to determine a site's more ancient Hebrew name. Conder's contribution was unique in that he did not eradicate the Arabic place names in his Survey of Western Palestine maps, but preserved their names intact, rather than attribute a site to a dubious identification. In his memoirs, he mentions that the Hebrew and Arabic traditions of place names are often consonant with each other:   \n\nThe names of the old towns and villages mentioned in the Bible remain for the most part almost unchanged... The fact that each name was carefully recorded in Arabic letters made it possible to compare with the Hebrew in a scientific and scholarly manner... When the Hebrew and the Arabic are shown to contain the same radicals, the same gutturals, and often the same meanings, we have a truly reliable comparison... We have now recovered more than three-quarters of the Bible names, and are thus able to say with confidence that the Bible topography is a genuine and actual topography, the work of Hebrews familiar with the country.\n\n\n== First modern Hebraization efforts ==\nModern Hebraization efforts began from the time in the First Aliyah in 1880. In the early 1920s, the HeHalutz youth movement began a Hebraization program for newly established settlements in Mandatory Palestine. These names, however, were applied only to sites purchased by the Jewish National Fund (JNF), as they had no sway over the names of other sites in Palestine. \nSeeing that directional signposts were frequently inscribed only in the Arabic language with their English transliterations (excluding their equivalent Hebrew names), the Jewish community in Palestine, led by prominent Zionists such as David Yellin, tried to influence the naming process initiated by the Royal Geographical Society's (RGS's) Permanent Committee on Geographical Names, so as to make the naming more inclusive. Despite these efforts, well-known cities and geographical places, such as Jerusalem, Jericho, Nablus, Hebron, the Jordan River, etc. carried names in both Hebrew and Arabic writing (e.g. Jerusalem / Al Quds / Yerushalayim and Hebron / Al Khalil / \u1e24evron), but lesser-known classical Jewish sites of antiquity (e.g. Jish / Gush Halab; Beisan /Beit She'an; Shefar-amr / Shefar\u02bbam; Kafr 'Inan / Kefar Hananiah; Beit Jibrin / Beit Gubrin, etc.) remained inscribed after their Arabic names, without change or addition. The main objection to adding additional spellings for ancient Hebrew toponymy was the fear that it would cause confusion to the postal service, when long accustomed names were given new names, as well as be totally at variance with the names already inscribed on maps. Therefore, British officials sought to ensure unified forms of place names.One of the motivating factors behind members of the Yishuv to apply Hebrew names to old Arabic names, despite attempts to the contrary by the RGS Committee for Names, was the belief by historical geographers, both Jewish and non-Jewish, that many Arabic place names were mere \"corruptions\" of older Hebrew names (e.g. Khirbet Shifat = Yodfat; Khirbet Tibneh = Timnah; Lifta = Nephtoah; Jabal al-Fureidis = Herodis, et al.). At other times, the history of assigning the \"restored Hebrew name\" to a site has been fraught with errors and confusion, as in the case of the ruin \u02bbIr\u00e2q el-Menshiyeh, situated where Kiryat Gat now stands. Initially, it was given the name Tel Gath, based on Albright's identification of the site with the biblical Gath. When this was found to be a misnomer, its name was changed to Tel Erani, which, too, was found to be an erroneous designation for what was thought to be the old namesake for the site.According to Professor Virginia Tilley, \"[a] body of scientific, linguistic, literary, historical, and biblical authorities was invented to foster impressions of Jewish belonging and natural rights in a Jewish homeland reproduced from a special Jewish right to this land, which clearly has been occupied, through the millennia, by many peoples.\"As early as 1920, a Hebrew sub-committee was established by the British government in Palestine with the aim of advising the government on the English transcript of names of localities and in determining the form of the Hebrew names for official use by the government.\n\n\n== JNF Naming Committee ==\nIn 1925, the Jewish National Fund established the Names Committee for the Settlements, led directly by the head of the JNF, Menachem Ussishkin.Meron Benvenisti writes that the Arabic geographical names upset the new Jewish community, for example on 22 April 1941 the Emeq Zevulun Settlements Committee wrote to the head office of the JNF:\nSuch names as the following are displayed in all their glory: Karbassa, al- Sheikh Shamali, Abu Sursuq, Bustan al-Shamali \u2013 all of them names that the JNF has no interest in immortalizing in the Z'vulun Valley.... We recommend to you that you send a circular letter to all of the settlements located on JNF land in the Z'vulun Valley and its immediate vicinity and warn them against continuing the above-mentioned practice [i.e., the use of] old maps that, from various points of view, are dangerous to use.\nBetween 1925 and 1948, the JNF Naming Committee gave names to 215 Jewish communities in Palestine. Although sweeping changes had come over the names of old geographic sites, a record of their old names is preserved on the old maps.\n\n\n=== Arabic language preeminence ===\nBy 1931, the destinational listings at post offices, signs at train stations and place names listed in the telephone directory, had removed any mention in Hebrew of \"Shechem\" (Nablus), \"Nazareth,\"  and \"Na\u1e25al Sorek\" (Wadi es-Sarar), which aroused the concern of the Jewish National Council that the British Government of Palestine was being prejudicial towards its Jewish citizens. Na\u1e25al Sorek, was a major route and thoroughfare when commuting by train from Jerusalem to Hartuv.\n\n\n== 1949: Committee for the Designation of Place-Names in the Negev ==\nIn late 1949, after the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, the new Israeli government created the Committee for the Designation of Place-Names in the Negev Region, a group of nine scholars whose job was to assign Hebrew names to towns, mountains, valleys, springs, roads, etc., in the Negev region. Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion had decided on the importance of renaming in the area earlier in the year, writing in his diary in July: \"We must give Hebrew names to these places \u2013 ancient names, if there are, and if not, new ones!\"; he subsequently established the committee's objectives with a letter to the chairman of the committee:\nWe are obliged to remove the Arabic names for reasons of state. Just as we do not recognize the Arabs' political proprietorship of the land, so also do we not recognize their spiritual proprietorship and their names.\nIn the Negev, 333 of the 533 new names which the committee decided upon were transliterations of, or otherwise similar-sounding to, the Arabic names. According to Bevenisti, some members of the committee had objected to the eradication of Arabic place names, but in many cases they were overruled by political and nationalistic considerations.\n\n\n== 1951: Governmental Naming Committee ==\nIn March 1951, the JNF committee and the Negev committee were merged to cover all of Israel. The new merged committee stated their belief that the \"Judaization of the geographical names in our country [is] a vital issue\". The work was ongoing as of 1960; in February 1960 the director of the Survey of Israel, Yosef Elster, wrote that \"We have ascertained that the replacement of Arabic names with Hebrew ones is not yet complete. The committee must quickly fill in what is missing, especially the names of ruins.\" In April 1951, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi and Dr. Benjamin Maisler were appointed to the Government Naming Committee.Between 1920 and 1990, the different committees had set Hebrew names for some 7,000 natural elements in the country, of which more than 5,000 were geographical place names, several hundred were names of historical sites, and over a thousand were names given to new settlements. Vilnay has noted that, since the 19th century, biblical words, expressions and phrases have provided names for many urban and rural settlements and neighborhoods in Modern Israel.While the names of many newer Jewish settlements had replaced the names of older Arab villages and ruins (e.g. Khirbet Jurfah becoming Roglit; Allar becoming Mata; al-Tira becoming Kfar Halutzim, which is now Bareket, etc.), leaving no traces of their former designations, Benvenisti has shown that the memorial of these ancient places had not been utterly lost through hegemonic practices:\n\nApproximately one-quarter of the 584 Arab villages that were standing in the 1980s, had names whose origins were ancient \u2013 biblical, Hellenistic, or Aramaic.\nToday, the Israeli Government Naming Committee discourages giving a name to a new settlement if its name cannot be shown to be connected in some way to the immediate area or region. Still, it is the only authorized arbiter of names, whether the name has a historical connection to the site or not.\n\n\n== Modern trends ==\nBy the 2010s, a trend emerged to restore the original Arabic street names which were Hebraized after 1948 in certain areas of Israel, particularly mixed Jewish\u2013Arab cities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHebraization of surnames\nIslamization of Jerusalem\nJudaization of Jerusalem\nJudaization of the Galilee\nPlace names of Palestine\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== General bibliography ==",
    "Frank J. Cobbs House": "The Frank J. Cobbs House is a private house located at 407 E. Chapin Street in Cadillac, Michigan.  It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1985 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.\n\n\n== History ==\nFrank J. Cobbs was born in Jackson County, Indiana in 1872, and was adopted by Jonathan W. Cobbs.  The Cobbs family soon moved to Cadillac where the elder Cobbs purchased a sawmill and, along with William W. Mitchell, founded the lumbering firm of Cobbs & Mitchell. Cobbs & Mitchell was among the largest lumbering firms in Michigan, supplying hardwood flooring and other products to consumers.  At its high point, Cobbs & Mitchell used 100,000 feet of raw lumber daily. Cobbs & Mitchell's operations played a major role in the economic development of Cadillac in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Frank Cobbs attended prep school at the University of Notre Dame, later attended the Michigan Military Academy, then obtained a degree from Olivet College in 1894.  He returned to Cadillac to work at Cobbs & Mitchell, and in 1895 organized the Cadillac State Bank.  However, soon after, his father Jonathon Cobbs became ill. As the only son, Frank Cobbs took over his father's place at Cobbs & Mitchell; the elder Cobbs eventually died in 1898.  Cobbs & Mitchell continued to grow under Frank Cobbs's management, with considerable investment in the Cadillac area and growing holdings in the Pacific Northwest.Cobbs married Maude Louise Belcher in April 1898; the same year, he had this house built for himself and his family by local builder James R. Fletcher.  It is thought that Detroit architect George D. Mason designed the house for Cobbs.  In 1905, additions were made to the house, including adding a reading room over the porte cochere and extending the east wing.  In 1912, the Cobbs moved to Oregon to supervise the Cobbs & Mitchell logging operations there, and in 1917 had an impressive Jacobethan mansion built in Portland.  Maud Louise Cobbs died in Portland in 1940; Frank J. Cobbs died in 1951.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Frank J. Cobbs House is a three-story Colonial Revival house with clapboard siding and a gambrel roof clad in red cedar shingles. The center of the front facade projects slightly forward and is surmounted by a gambrel-roof gable. One end of the house has a gable-roofed wing, while the other has what was once a porte cochere, which is now enclosed with an added second story room. The central portion of the facade projects slightly forward of the primary facade plane and is topped by a gambrel-roof gable. The exterior contains a variety of decorative elements, including a Palladian window, windows with molded caps, round-head dormers, and fluted columns and pilasters.A former carriage house, matching the main house in style, is sited nearby.\n\n\n== References ==",

He was a member of the House of Saud.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPrince Nasser was born in Qasr Al Hukm, Riyadh, in 1911. There are other reports, giving his birth date as 1913 and as 1921. He was the sixth son of King Abdulaziz. His mother was Bazza, a Moroccan woman. Prince Nasser had no full-brothers or full-sisters. He received education in Riyadh at the school of the palace, learning Quran, horsemanship and war techniques.\n\n\n== Riyadh governorship ==\nIn 1938, King Abdulaziz appointed him as the governor of Riyadh Province. However, he had to resign from his post due to an incident in which several foreigners died of alcohol poisoning. Upon hearing of this event, King Abdulaziz threw him in jail. He was replaced by his half-brother Sultan bin Abdulaziz in the post. Subsequently, Nasser bin Abdulaziz lost his post and never returned to public life.\n\n\n== Exclusion from succession and allegiances ==\nPrince Nasser and his half-brother Prince Saad were excluded from the succession, and their younger half-brother Fahd was selected as crown prince instead in 1975. However, the supersession did not cause turmoil because both Nasser and Saad were regarded as weak contenders due to being relatively less experienced. Furthermore, Prince Nasser lost his chance to become king due to \"dissolute\" mores. He was regarded as unsuitable for succession by the larger family. His lack of accomplishment and low birth (his mother was a woman of colour from Morocco) were also factors leading to his exclusion.Prince Nasser was one of two sons of King Abdulaziz who did not support the Crown Prince Faisal in his struggle with King Saud.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOne of his wives, Muhdi bint Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Sudairi, was the younger sister of his step-mother, Hassa, who was one of King Abdulaziz's wives and the mother of seven influential sons, known as the Sudairi Seven. Naseer and Muhdi had five sons: Prince Khalid, Prince Abdullah, Prince Fahd, Prince Turki and Prince Ahmed. His other spouse was a daughter of Abdullah bin Mutaib Al Rashid.One of Nasser's sons, Turki, was a former military officer and the former head of the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment (PME). Another son, Mohammed bin Nasser, is the governor of Jizan Province. Mansour bin Nasser was one of King Abdullah's advisors. Yet another son, Abdulaziz bin Nasser, is a businessman and the father of Saud bin Abdulaziz, who murdered his servant in London in 2010. Abdullah bin Nasser, another son of Prince Nasser, was the president of Saudi football club Al Hilal in the 1970s.Prince Nasser's daughter, Al Bandarah, died in Riyadh in February 2017.\n\n\n== Later years and death ==\nPrince Nasser could not walk and used a wheelchair in his last years. He died on 15 September 1984 and was buried in Riyadh.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nHis family founded Prince Nasser bin Abdulaziz Center for Autism, an affiliated body of the Saudi Autism Center; the center was opened in April 2012.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\n\n\n== References ==",

He scored 34 goals in 99 league games in a 12-year career in the English Football League. He won the First Division title with Burnley in 1959\u201360, and won the Second Division title with Leeds United in 1963\u201364.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Burnley ===\nLawson started his career as an amateur at Burnley after being scouted in a local School's cup final, along with James Robson. Despite some good times, including a purple patch in the \"Clarets\" 1957 FA Cup run, Lawson found it hard to break into the highly successful first team. During this period Burnley were competing at the top of the First Division, and were crowned champions of the English Football League in 1959\u201360 under the stewardship of Harry Potts.

He went straight into the first team, making his debut at Vale Park in a 2\u20131 win over Southport on 20 August. However, he lost his place the following month and was limited to one goal in ten league and cup games in the 1966\u201367 season. He was given a free transfer to Fourth Division rivals Barnsley in May 1967.

In 2016, an anonymous donor established the Paul and Christine Englund Professorship at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Englund's honor.\n\n\n== Work ==\nA prolific researcher, Englund published more than 190 scholarly articles, and his work has been cited more than 10,000 times. He is best known for his work with African trypanosomiasis, a potentially fatal disease that infects both human and animals, which is spread by the tse-tse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. Englund's focus was on researching the structure and function of the genetic material in trypanosomes, the parasites that also lend their name to the disease. As the John Hopkins School of Medicine explained in their obituary:One focus of his research was GPI anchors. Composed mainly of sugars and fats, GPIs hold proteins to cell surfaces in all animals and are especially abundant in trypanosomes. In searching for the source of GPIs, he discovered a unique way that fatty acids are made in trypanosomes that is not found in other organisms. During his research career, Englund authored nearly 190 journal articles.\n\n\n== Awards and memberships ==\nMember of the National Academy of Sciences (elected 2012)\nMember of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology\nMember of the American Association for the Advancement of Science\n\n\n== Personal ==\nBorn in Worcester, Massachusetts to Theodore, a mechanical engineer father, and a homemaker mother Mildred, Englund grew up alongside brother Donald, a teacher and Robert, a doctor, as well as his cousin, the artist Joyce Reopel. He went on to study chemistry at Hamilton College, graduating in 1960, and his doctorate in biochemistry at Rockefeller University, graduating in 1966.

    "Independent Party (Laos)": "The Independent Party (Lao: \u0e9e\u0eb1\u0e81\u0ec0\u0eaa\u0ea3\u0eb5, romanized: Phak Seri) was a political party in Laos.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe party was established by members of Lao Issara in 1945. Led by Phoui Sananikone, the party was involved in post-war governments, with Phoui appointed Minister of Health, Education and Welfare in 1947, and served as Prime Minister in 1950 and 1951. The party won ten seats in the 1951 parliamentary elections, but was reduced to seven seats in the 1955 elections.Prior to the 1958 supplementary elections the party held talks with the National Progressive Party about an electoral pact in order to counter the Lao Patriotic Front. However, the parties failed to agree on a joint list, and split their vote, resulting in the Patriotic Front winning the most seats. The two merged later in the year to form the Lao People's Rally.\n\n\n== References ==",

He owned the Lion Pharmacy in Copenhagen from 1791 to 1805, managed \u00d8rholm and Brede Works from 1805 to 1811 and served as director of the Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Manufactory from 1796 to 1812. He lived on the Falkensteen estate at Slagelse from 1812.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nManthey was born in Gl\u00fcckstadt, the son of garrison priest Johan Gustav Ludvig Manthey (1735-1813) and Sophia Dorothea Hermes (1745-1826). His father later served as parish priest at the German St. Peter's Church in Copenhagen. His younger brother was  Johan Daniel Timotheus Manthey.\nLudvig Manthey studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen and was in 1788  appointed as chief surgeon on a naval ship and later that same year as a lecturer in Copenhagen. He was also employed as a teacher at the pharmacy of Frederiks Hospital in spite of the fact that he had not apprenticed as a pharmacist. In 1789, he also obtained a degree in pharmacy from the university.

    "It's Magic, Charlie Brown": "It's Magic, Charlie Brown is the 21st prime-time animated television special based upon the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on April 28, 1981.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nCharlie Brown decides that Snoopy needs to educate himself, and gives him his library card to check out a few books. Snoopy takes out a book about magic, and during the opening credits, Snoopy practices magic with Woodstock by his side. Charlie Brown warns both of them that the cat next door will get really upset if they become too loud. However, Snoopy and Woodstock continue to practice magic and the cat next door angrily rips Snoopy's doghouse apart. \nSnoopy performs a magic show with the name \"The Great Houndini.\" During the show, Snoopy pulls out Woodstock (with rabbit ears) out of his hat and does a ring trick that goes wrong. Both of these tricks raises the ire of a kid who heckles the tricks, but Snoopy silences him twice. He also does the stick in the hole trick to Franklin, the amputation decapitation trick to Peppermint Patty, identifying objects with his eyes closed, cutting Linus' security blanket into strips, the levitation trick to Lucy, and biggest of all, making Charlie Brown literally disappear. \nA sudden rainstorm ends the show early, and Charlie Brown is left invisible. He decides to feed Snoopy and show him what has happened. When Snoopy realizes he cannot yet undo the trick, he tries several ideas to make him visible again, including draping a sheet over Charlie Brown with a necktie to fasten it along with a pair of oversized shoes. Charlie Brown goes inside, which scares Sally, and when he looks in the mirror and sees that Snoopy made him resemble a ghost, he faints.\nMeanwhile, Linus tells Lucy that Sally told him that even when you look at Charlie Brown, you do not see him, but Lucy does not believe this. \nDespite this shortcoming, Charlie Brown realizes he has a golden opportunity to kick Lucy's football without her knowing. Charlie Brown finally succeeds in kicking the football and taunts her about it. Furious over Charlie Brown succeeding in kicking the football, Lucy hands the magic book to Snoopy. Then she threatens him that if he does not make Charlie Brown visible again, she is going to pound him. \nAfter practicing some counterspells on Woodstock (making his feet and his head bigger and making him disappear), he is unsure where Charlie Brown is. Snoopy casts a counterspell on Charlie Brown, and, when Lucy sees Charlie Brown reappearing, Lucy pulls the football away causing Charlie Brown to land flat on his back. \nHowever, Charlie Brown is happy that he kicked the football when he was invisible, although Lucy says no one will believe him. Charlie Brown says that Snoopy will believe him. When Lucy scoffs at Snoopy, the insulted beagle magically levitates Lucy into the sky, and leaves her stuck there as payback. Charlie Brown and Snoopy laugh and dance away to conclude a satisfying day, ignoring Lucy's pleads to get her down. \nDuring the closing credits, Linus eventually pulls Lucy down to the ground with his blanket. However, Lucy (despite being free) becomes furious about what happened. She blames the mishap on Linus, gives up, and stomps away.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nMichael Mandy as Charlie Brown\nPeter Robbins as Charlie Brown screaming (archived)\nSydney Penny as Lucy van Pelt\nCindi Reilly as Sally Brown\nEarl Reilly as Linus van Pelt, Franklin\nBrent Hauer as Peppermint Patty\nShannon Cohn/Casey Carlson as Marcie\nChristopher Donohone as Schroeder\nBill Melendez as Snoopy, Woodstock\n\n\n== Note ==\nProduction completed at Marvel Productions.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nIt's Magic, Charlie Brown was released on DVD on September 2, 2008 as a bonus feature on Warner Home Video's remaster of It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIt's Magic, Charlie Brown at IMDb",
    "Love Is All You Love": "\"All You Need Is Love\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a non-album single in July 1967. It was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon\u2013McCartney partnership. The song was Britain's contribution to Our World, the first live global television link, for which the band were filmed performing it at EMI Studios in London on 25 June. The programme was broadcast via satellite and seen by an audience of over 400 million in 25 countries. Lennon's lyrics were deliberately simplistic, to allow for the show's international audience, and captured the utopian ideals associated with the Summer of Love. The single topped sales charts in Britain, the United States and many other countries, and became an anthem for the counterculture's embrace of flower power philosophy.\nOur World coincided with the height of the Beatles' popularity and influence, following the release of their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Rather than perform the song entirely live, the group played to a pre-recorded backing track. With an orchestral arrangement by George Martin, the song begins with a portion of the French national anthem and ends with musical quotations from works such as Glenn Miller's \"In the Mood\", \"Greensleeves\", Bach's Invention No. 8 in F major, and the Beatles' 1963 hit \"She Loves You\". Adding to the broadcast's festive atmosphere, the studio was adorned with signs and streamers, and filled with guests dressed in psychedelic attire, including members of the Rolling Stones, the Who and the Small Faces. Brian Epstein, the Beatles' manager, described the performance as the band's \"finest\" moment.\"All You Need Is Love\" was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour album and served as the moral for the Beatles' 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine. Originally broadcast in black-and-white, the Our World performance was colourised for inclusion in the Beatles' 1995 Anthology documentary series. While the song remains synonymous with the 1967 Summer of Love ethos and provided the foundation for Lennon's legacy as a humanitarian, numerous critics found the message naive in retrospect, particularly during the 1980s. Since 2009, Global Beatles Day, an international celebration of the Beatles' music and social message, takes place on 25 June each year in tribute to their Our World performance.\n\n\n== Background and inspiration ==\n\nOn 18 May 1967, the Beatles signed a contract to appear as Britain's representatives on Our World, which was to be broadcast live internationally, via satellite, on 25 June. The Beatles were asked to provide a song with a message that could be easily understood by everyone, and using \"basic English\" terms. The band undertook the assignment at a time when they were considering making a television special, Magical Mystery Tour, and working on songs for the animated film Yellow Submarine, for which they were contractually obliged to United Artists to supply four new recordings. \"All You Need Is Love\" was selected for Our World for its contemporary social significance over the Paul McCartney-written \"Your Mother Should Know\". In a statement to Melody Maker magazine, Brian Epstein, the band's manager, said of \"All You Need Is Love\": \"It was an inspired song and they really wanted to give the world a message. The nice thing about it is that it cannot be misinterpreted. It is a clear message saying that love is everything.\"John Lennon later attributed the song's simple lyrical statements to his liking of slogans and television advertising. He likened the song to a propaganda piece, adding: \"I'm a revolutionary artist. My art is dedicated to change.\" Author Mark Hertsgaard views it as the Beatles' \"most political song yet\" up to 1967 and the origins of Lennon's posthumous standing as a \"humanitarian hero\". The song's advocacy of the all-importance of love followed Lennon's introduction of the idea in his lyrics to \"The Word\" in 1965 and George Harrison's declaration in \"Within You Without You\", from the band's recently released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, that \"With our love, we could save the world\".The Beatles were unimpressed when Epstein first told them that he had arranged for their appearance on Our World, and they delayed choosing a song for the broadcast. In their interviews for The Beatles Anthology in the 1990s, McCartney and Harrison say they were unsure whether \"All You Need Is Love\" was written for Our World, while Ringo Starr and George Martin, the Beatles' producer, state that it was. McCartney said: \"It was certainly tailored to [the broadcast] once we had it. But I've got a feeling it was just one of John's songs that was coming anyway.\" In McCartney's recollection, the song was entirely Lennon's, with Harrison, Starr and his own contributions confined to \"ad-libs\" at the end of the recording.\n\n\n== Composition and musical structure ==\n\n\n=== Main portion ===\n\"All You Need Is Love\" contains an asymmetric time signature and complex changes. Musicologist Russell Reising writes that, although the song represents the peak of the Beatles' overtly psychedelic phase, the change in metre during the verses is the sole example of the experimental aspect that typifies the band's work in that genre. The main verse pattern contains a total of 29 beats, split into two 74 measures, a single bar of 84, followed by a one bar return of 74 before repeating the pattern. The chorus, however, maintains a steady 44 beat with the exception of the last bar of 64 (on the lyric \"love is all you need\"). The prominent cello line draws attention to this departure from pop-single normality, although it was not the first time that the Beatles had experimented with varied metre within a single song: \"Love You To\" and \"She Said She Said\" were earlier examples.The song is in the key of G and the verse opens (on \"There's nothing you can do\") with a G chord and D melody note, the chords shifting in a I\u2013V\u2013vi chord progression while the bass simultaneously moves from the tonic (G) note to the root note of the relative minor (E minor), via an F\u266f, supporting a first inversion D chord. After the verse \"learn how to play the game, it's easy\", the bass alters the prolonged V (D) chord with F\u266f, E, C and B notes. The song includes a dramatic use of a dominant or V chord (here D) on \"It's easy.\" The \"Love, love, love\" chant involves chords in a I\u2013V7\u2013vi shift (G\u2013D\u2013Em) and simultaneous descending B, A, G notes with the concluding G note corresponding not to the tonic G chord, but acting as the third of the E minor chord; this also introducing the E note of the Em chord as a 6th of the tonic G scale. Supporting the same melody note with different and unexpected chords has been termed a characteristic Beatles technique.According to Reising, the lyrics advance the Beatles' anti-materialistic message and are an \"anthemic tribute\" to universal love in which \"nothing is tempered or modulated\". He says that Lennon favours words such as \"nothing\", \"no one\", \"nowhere\" and \"all\", thereby presenting a series of \"extreme statements\" that conclude with \"the final reversals of 'All you need is love' and 'Love is all you need'\".\n\n\n=== Quotations and coda ===\nOn the Beatles' recording, the song starts with the first few bars of the French national anthem, \"La Marseillaise\", and contains elements from other musical works, such as Glenn Miller's 1939 hit \"In the Mood\". This use of musical quotations follows an approach first adopted by the Beatles in Harrison's composition \"It's All Too Much\", which similarly reflects the ideology behind the hippie movement during the 1967 Summer of Love. George Martin recalled that in \"All You Need Is Love\" \"the boys ... wanted to freak out at the end, and just go mad\". During the long coda, elements of other musical works can be heard, including \"Greensleeves\", Invention No. 8 in F major (BWV 779) by J. S. Bach, \"In the Mood\", and the Beatles' own songs \"She Loves You\" and \"Yesterday\". The first of these three pieces had been included in the arrangement by Martin, while \"She Loves You\" and \"Yesterday\" were the result of improvisation by Lennon during rehearsals.Like musicologist Alan Pollack, Kenneth Womack views the \"She Loves You\" refrain as serving a similar purpose to the wax models of the Beatles depicted on the cover of Sgt. Pepper, beside the real-life band members, and therefore a further example of the group distancing themselves from their past. In his book Rock, Counterculture and the Avant-Garde, author Doyle Greene describes the combination of the \"Love is all you need\" refrain, \"She Loves You\" reprise, and orchestral quotations from Bach and Miller as \"a joyous, collective anarchy signifying the utopian dreams of the counterculture topped off with a postmodern fanfare\".\n\n\n== Recording ==\n\n\n=== Backing track ===\nThe Beatles began recording the backing track for the song at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes, south-west London, on 14 June 1967. The producers of Our World were initially unhappy about the use of a backing track for the broadcast, but Martin insisted, saying, \"we can't just go in front of 350 million people without some work\". The initial line-up was Lennon on harpsichord, McCartney on double bass with a bow, Harrison on violin \u2013 three instruments that were unfamiliar to the musicians \u2013 while Starr played drums. The band recorded 33 takes, before choosing the tenth take as the best. This performance was transferred onto a new 4-track tape, with the four instruments mixed into one track. The engineers at Olympic thought the Beatles displayed a surprising lack of care during this process, a sign, according to author Ian MacDonald, of the group's new preference for randomness in contrast to the high production standards of Sgt. Pepper.From 19 June, working at Studio 2 in EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios), the Beatles recorded overdubs including piano (played by Martin), banjo, guitar and some vocal parts. Among the latter were the \"Love, love, love\" refrains, and a Lennon vocal over the song's choruses. On 23 June, the band began rehearsing the song with an orchestra, whose playing was also added to the backing track. On 24 June, the day before the broadcast, the Beatles decided that the song would be their next single. Late that morning, a press call was held at EMI Studios, attended by over 100 journalists and photographers, followed by further rehearsals and recording. Publicity photos were taken during the press call and rehearsals, and a BBC television crew blocked the camera angles required for the live performance. As part of this pre-broadcast promotion, the Beatles posed in a yard beside the studio building, wearing boards that together spelt out \"All You Need Is Love\" and approximations of the song title in three other languages.\n\n\n=== Live broadcast ===\n\nThe Our World broadcast took place in the wake of the Arab\u2013Israeli Six-Day War and, for the Beatles, amid the public furore caused by McCartney's admission that he had taken LSD. On 25 June, the live transmission cut to EMI Studios at 8:54 pm London time, about 40 seconds earlier than expected. Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick were drinking scotch whisky to calm their nerves for the task of mixing the audio for a live worldwide broadcast, and had to scramble the bottle and glasses beneath the mixing desk when they were told they were about to go on air.The Beatles (except for Starr, behind his drum kit) were seated on high stools, accompanied by a thirteen-piece orchestra. The band were surrounded by friends and acquaintances seated on the floor, who sang along with the refrain during the fade-out. These guests included Mick Jagger, Eric Clapton, Marianne Faithfull, Keith Richards, Keith Moon, Graham Nash, Pattie Boyd (Harrison's wife), along with Mike McGear and Jane Asher (McCartney's brother and girlfriend, respectively). The studio setting was designed to reflect the communal aspect of the occasion while also demonstrating the position of influence that the Beatles held among their peers, particularly following the release of Sgt. Pepper. Many of the invitations were extended through Beatles aides Mal Evans and Tony Bramwell, who had visited various London nightclubs the night before the broadcast.\n\nAlso among the studio audience were members of the Small Faces and the design collective the Fool. Balloons, flowers, streamers and \"Love\" graffiti added to the celebratory atmosphere. The Beatles and their entourage were dressed in psychedelic clothes and scarves; in his report on the performance, Barry Miles likened the setting to a medieval gathering, broken only by the presence of modern studio equipment such as large headphones and microphones. According to Michael Frontani, an associate professor of communications, whereas Sgt. Pepper showed the Beatles as artists and \"serious musicians\", Our World emphasised their identity as members of the hippie counterculture.The segment was directed by Derek Burrell-Davis, the head of the BBC's Our World project. It opened with the band playing \"All You Need Is Love\" for about a minute, before Martin, speaking from the studio control room, suggested that the orchestra should take their places for the recording as the tape was rewound. The BBC presenter, Steve Race, announced that the Beatles had just recorded this performance and were about to complete the recording live. In fact, in author John Winn's description, Race's statements were part of the \"staged\" aspect of the segment, which purported to show the Beatles at work in the studio: the opening footage of the band (merely rehearsing over the backing track) had been filmed earlier, and by the time Martin appeared to be issuing instructions, the orchestra were already seated in Studio 1. The Beatles, accompanied by the orchestra and the studio guests, then performed the entire song, overdubbing onto the pre-recorded rhythm track. In addition to the lead and backing vocals and the orchestra, the live elements were McCartney's bass guitar part, Harrison's guitar solo and Starr's drums. In the opinion of music critic Richie Unterberger, the performance of \"All You Need Is Love\" is \"the best footage of the Beatles in the psychedelic period\" and \"captures Flower Power at its zenith, with enough irreverence to avoid pomposity, what with the sandwich boards of lyrics, the florid clothing and decor, and celebrity guests\".\n\n\n=== Final overdubs ===\n\nLennon, affecting indifference, was said to be nervous about the broadcast, given the potential size of the international TV audience. Later on 25 June, dissatisfied with his singing, he re-recorded the solo verses for use on the single. On 26 June, in EMI's Studio 2, Lennon's vocal was treated with ADT, and Starr overdubbed a drum roll at the start of the track, replacing a tambourine part.The programme was shown in black-and-white since colour television had yet to commence broadcasting in Britain and most of the world. The Beatles' footage was colourised, based on photographs of the event, for the 1995 documentary The Beatles Anthology. Over the documentary's end credits, a snippet of studio conversation from the 25 June overdubbing session includes Lennon telling Martin: \"I'm ready to sing for the world, George, if you can just give me the backing \u2026\" The colour version of the band's Our World appearance also appears on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\n\"All You Need Is Love\" was issued in the UK on 7 July 1967, on EMI's Parlophone label, with \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\" as the B-side. The US release, on Capitol Records, took place on 17 July. In his contemporary review for Melody Maker, Nick Jones said the Beatles represented the \"progressive avant-garde\" in their approach to singles releases, and that \"All You Need Is Love\" was \"another milestone in their very phenomenal career\". He described the song as a \"cool, calculated contagious Beatles singsong\" that was more immediate than \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", and concluded: \"The message is 'love' and I hope everyone in the whole wide world manages to get it.\" The single entered the Record Retailer chart (subsequently the UK Singles Chart) at number 2 before topping the listings for three weeks. In the US, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 for a week. The song was a number 1 hit in many other countries. It was also the subject of a copyright dispute between EMI and KPM, the publisher of \"In the Mood\", later in July. Since Martin had not checked the copyright status of Miller's piece before incorporating it into the coda, EMI were obliged to pay royalties to KPM. On 11 September, \"All You Need Is Love\" was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThe single coincided with the height of the Beatles' popularity and influence during the 1960s, following the release of Sgt. Pepper. In his retrospective feature on the song in Rolling Stone, Gavin Edwards writes that \"All You Need Is Love\" provided \"the sing-song anthem for the Summer of Love, with a sentiment that was simple but profound\". According to historian David Simonelli, such was the band's international influence, it was the song that formally announced the arrival of flower power ideology as a mainstream concept. The Beatles followed up the utopian spirit of Our World in their activities over July and August, during their first summer free of tour commitments. In late July, the band investigated the possibility of buying a Greek island with a view to setting up a hippie-style commune for themselves and members of their inner circle. After sailing around the Aegean Sea and approving a location on the island of Leslo, the Beatles decided against the idea and returned to London. In early August, Harrison and a small entourage made a well-publicised visit to the international hippie capital of Haight-Ashbury, in San Francisco.Writing in 2001, Peter Doggett said that the Beatles' performance on Our World \"remains one of the strongest visual impressions of the summer of love\"; Womack describes it as \"flower power's finest moment\". Rolling Stone ranks \"All You Need Is Love\" 370th on its list of the \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" and 21st on its \"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\" list. Mojo placed it at number 28 on a similar list of the best Beatles songs. In his commentary for the magazine, producer and musician Dave Stewart admired the track's \"jumbled-up mix of music \u2013 marching band and rock'n'roll\" and recalled the Beatles' Our World appearance as \"a signal for those [of us] who felt we were trapped in a mental hospital in some suburban town to break out\". In 2018, the music staff of Time Out London ranked \"All You Need Is Love\" at number 4 on their list of the best Beatles songs.In November 1967, \"All You Need Is Love\" was included on the American LP version of Magical Mystery Tour, together with the band's other singles tracks from that year. It was also included on the Yellow Submarine soundtrack album, released in January 1969. As a statement on the power of universal love, the song served as the moral in the Yellow Submarine film; it plays over a scene where Lennon's character defeats the Blue Meanies by throwing the word \"Love\" at their evil Flying Glove. The song is also featured in Cirque du Soleil's show Love, based on the songs of the Beatles. It was sequenced as the closing track of the 2006 soundtrack album.\n\n\n== Cultural responses and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Social relevance ===\n\nIn a 1981 article on the musical and societal developments of 1967, sociomusicologist Simon Frith described \"All You Need Is Love\" as a \"genuinely moving song\" and said that, further to the impact of Sgt. Pepper, the international broadcast confirmed \"the Beatles' evangelical role\" in a year when \"it seemed the whole world was waiting for something new, and the power of music was beyond doubt.\" Psychiatrist and New Left advocate R.D. Laing wrote about the song's contemporary appeal:\n\nThe times fitted [the Beatles] like a glove. Everyone was getting the feel of the world as a global village \u2013 as us, one species. The whole human race was becoming unified under the shadow of death ... One of the most heartening things about the Beatles was that they gave expression to a shared sense of celebration around the world, a sense of the same sensibility.\nDoyle Greene writes that because of its presentation as the conclusion to Our World, \"All You Need Is Love\" provided \"a distinctly political statement\". He says that the song was \"selling peace\" on a programme that aimed to foster international understanding in a climate of Cold War hostility, the Vietnam War and revolutionary unrest in the Third World. By contrast, NME critics Roy Carr and Tony Tyler detected self-parody in the song, saying that the Beatles sought to debunk their elevated status during the Summer of Love.According to author Jon Wiener, \"All You Need Is Love\" served as \"the anthem of flower power\" that summer but also, like Sgt. Pepper, highlighted the ideological gulf between the predominantly white hippie movement and the increasingly political ghetto culture in the US. Wiener says that the song's pacifist agenda infuriated many student radicals from the New Left and that these detractors \"continued to denounce [Lennon] for it for the rest of his life\". He also writes that, in summer 1967, \"links between the counterculture and the New Left remained murky\", since a full dialogue regarding politics and rock music was still a year away and would only be inspired by Lennon's 1968 song \"Revolution\".In the mid 1970s, according to Carr and Tyler, it was still \"impossible\" to hear the start of the French national anthem without launching into \"All You Need Is Love\", yet even a contrite \"reformed hippie\" could \"bellow tunelessly along with this glorious, irreverent single without any real embarrassment \u2013 a measure of its internal strength and durability\".\n\n\n=== Retrospective criticism ===\n\nIn the decades following the record's release, Beatles biographers and music journalists criticised the lyrics as naive and simplistic and detected a smugness in the message; the song's musical content was similarly dismissed as unimaginative. Ian MacDonald viewed it as \"one of The Beatles' less deserving hits\" and, in its apparently chaotic production, typical of the band's self-indulgent work immediately after Sgt. Pepper. Regarding the song's message, MacDonald writes:\n\nDuring the materialistic Eighties, this song's title was the butt of cynics, there being, obviously, any number of additional things needed to sustain life on earth. It should, perhaps, be pointed out that this record was not conceived as a blueprint for a successful career. \"All you need is love\" is a transcendental statement, as true on its level as the principle of investment on the level of the stock exchange. In the idealistic perspective of 1967 \u2013 the polar opposite of 1987 \u2013 its title makes perfect sense.\nWriting in 1988, author and critic Tim Riley identified the track's \"internal contradictions (positivisms expressed with negatives)\" and \"bloated self-confidence ('it's easy')\" as qualities that rendered it as \"the naive answer to 'A Day in the Life'\". By contrast, Mark Hertsgaard considers \"All You Need Is Love\" to be among the Beatles' finest songs and one of the few highlights among their recordings from the Magical Mystery Tour\u2013Yellow Submarine era. In his opinion, Lennon's detractors fail to discern between \"shallow and utopian\" when ridiculing the song as socially irrelevant, and he adds: \"one may as well complain that Martin Luther King was a poor singer as criticize Lennon on fine points of political strategy; his role was the Poet, not the Political Organizer.\"Writing in 2017, Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times said that the song \"appears hopelessly naive 50 years on\" yet its espousal of global connectedness had become increasingly relevant. In his view, through Our World, \"'All You Need Is Love' marked a new chapter in the world's colonisation by telecommunications\", and its message inspired the sentiments behind \"Love Trumps Hate\", displayed on placards protesting Donald Trump's 2016 US presidential win, and the One Love Manchester benefit concert.\n\n\n=== Validity of message ===\nIn Granada Television's 1987 documentary It Was Twenty Years Ago Today, commemorating two decades since Sgt. Pepper and the Summer of Love, several of the interviewees were asked whether they still believed that \"Love is all you need\". Harrison was the only one who unequivocally agreed with the sentiment. Asked why this was, he told Mark Ellen of Q magazine: \"They all said All You Need Is Love but you also need such-and-such else. But \u2026 love is complete knowledge. If we all had total knowledge, then we would have complete love and, on that basis, everything is taken care of. It's a law of nature.\"In 2009, George Vaillant, the chief investigator of the Grant Study, which tracked 268 Harvard undergraduates for a period of 80 years with the goal of finding what factors led to longevity, said that happiness had a strong correlation to close relationships, summarising: \"Happiness is love. Full stop.\" The CBC reported that the \"[Grant] study proves Beatles right: All You Need is Love.\"\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nDuring the Yes campaign of the Pablo Picasso purchase referendum of 1967, the slogan \"All we need is Pablo\" was used in reference to the song.\nIn February 1968, \"All You Need Is Love\" was played in the \"Fall Out\" episode of the TV series The Prisoner, directed by Patrick McGoohan. It was a rare example of the Beatles licensing their music for use in another artist's film or television project.\nTony Palmer titled his 17-part television series All You Need Is Love: The Story of Popular Music after the Beatles song. The series, which first aired in 1977, included an episode (\"Mighty Good\") dedicated to the band.\nIn 1978, the Rutles parodied \"All You Need Is Love\" in their song \"Love Life\" and titled their television film satirising the Beatles' history All You Need Is Cash. According to New York Times journalist Marc Spitz, writing in 2013, this title was \"really an attack\" on the commercialisation of rock music by the late 1970s.\nHarrison showed his enduring admiration for the song by referencing it in his 1981 tribute to Lennon, \"All Those Years Ago\".\nBob Geldof said he wrote the 1984 Band Aid charity single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" out of a wish to create \"something that could be sung all around the world, like 'All You Need Is Love'\". He also credited the Beatles' Our World performance as part of his inspiration for staging Live Aid in 1985.\nAt Live Aid on 13 July 1985, Elvis Costello performed \"All You Need Is Love\" before a television audience estimated at up to 1.9 billion. Costello introduced it as an \"old Northern English folk song\" and sang with a \"vitriolic snarl\", in Riley's description, that suggested \"how far there still was to go rather than how far we'd come\" in terms of realising the song's message.\n\"All You Need Is Love\" was part of Queen Elizabeth II's entrance music at the official millennium celebrations on 31 December 1999. The Beatles' recording was played just before the midnight festivities at the Millennium Dome in London. In 2002, the song was performed by choirs across Britain during the queen's Golden Jubilee celebrations.\nTo the dismay of many purists, a cover version of the song was used in a 2007 advertisement for Procter & Gamble's Luvs baby product brand.\nIn 2009, Global Beatles Day was founded as an international celebration of the Beatles' music and social message. The event takes place on 25 June each year in memory of the Our World performance of the song.\nIn October 2021, American singer Katy Perry released a cover of \"All You Need Is Love\" for a Gap holiday advertisement.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, except where noted:\nThe Beatles\n\nJohn Lennon \u2013 lead and backing vocals, harpsichord, banjo\nPaul McCartney \u2013 bass, double bass, backing vocals\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 lead guitar, violin, backing vocals\nRingo Starr \u2013 drumsAdditional participants\n\nGeorge Martin \u2013 piano, orchestral arrangement, production\nMike Vickers \u2013 conductor\nSidney Sax, Patrick Halling, Eric Bowie, John Ronayne \u2013 violins\nLionel Ross, Jack Holmes \u2013 cellos\nRex Morris, Don Honeywill \u2013 tenor saxophones\nDavid Mason \u2013 trumpet\nStanley Woods \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn\nEvan Watkins, Harry Spain \u2013 trombones\nJack Emblow \u2013 accordion\nMick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton, Marianne Faithfull, Jane Asher, Pattie Boyd, Mike McGear, Keith Moon, Graham Nash, Hunter Davies, Gary Walker and others \u2013 background vocals\n\n\n== Charts and certifications ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFull lyrics for the song at the Beatles' official website",

    "Fort Sherman virus": "Fort Sherman virus (FSV) is a single-stranded, negative sense, tri-segmented RNA virus. The virus is an isolate of Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) and closely related to Cache Valley virus (CVV). There are multiple strains of the virus, each with individual characteristics including the Panama, Brazil, and Argentina strains. Of the three strains, the Panama strain is the only reassortment of them. Research suggests reassortment during the genealogy of the Panama strain. This was found while analyzing the M segment of the virus in which the Brazil and Argentina strains closely matched while the Panama strain matched closely with CVV. The L and S segments matched closely for all three strains.\n\n\n== Transmission ==\nThree different species have been found to contain Fort Sherman virus which are humans, horses, and mosquitos. Currently, it is unknown whether the divergent South American strains of the virus are able to be transmitted to humans.\n\n\n== Symptoms ==\nSymptoms in humans include fever, muscle pain, sore throat, and malaise.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFort Sherman virus is found in a geographic range of more than 7,000 km, solely in South America.

    "INS Shikra": "INS Shikra, formerly known as INS Kunjali, is an Indian naval air station located at Colaba in Mumbai, Maharashtra. It is a heliport.\n\n\n== History ==\nNAS Kunjali was commissioned as a new establishment in Mumbai, post-Independence. The locale chosen for the establishment was the old Gun Carriage Basin on the sea front in Colaba, in the heart of South Mumbai.  The area was used during the Second World War as a depot for munitions of war and as a boat repair facility. With the acquisition of Allouette III helicopters (now HAL Chetak) in 1963, the establishment was considered suitable for a helipad. The first time a helicopter operated from the base was on a temporary grass helipad in 1964. Allouette flights thereafter continued to operate from the helipad, on a makeshift and as required basis.\nFinally, on 3 April 1972 \u2018Bombay flight\u2019 of the Goa-based INAS 321 was established with one Allouette III helicopter, two pilots and 17 sailors. On 1 August 1980, one more Chetak was added to the flight and the role of the squadron was enhanced to include VIP flight commitment, Fleet Requirement task including tracking for weapon alignment, casualty evacuation and SAR duties. With the introduction of helicopters on board ships, the base housed and operated these helicopters, when disembarked and a helicopter maintenance facility was set up in 1983.\nThe Naval Air Station was renamed to INS Shikra in an impressive commissioning ceremony presided over by the Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, PVSM, AVSM, ADC on 22 January 2009. The commissioning commanding officer was Captain Philipose George Pynumootil.\n\n\n== Objective ==\nINS Shikra has grown from a small helipad to a full-fledged Heliport providing support and maintenance facilities to the integral flights of the fleet and aviation requirements of the Western Naval Command. The facilities continue to expand to cater for increasing numbers of helicopters being inducted on board ships. Its primary role is to provide administrative, technical and logistic support for all squadrons and flights based in Mumbai. In addition, it undertakes coastal patrol, air surveillance in the area and meets the operational flying requirements of the Western Naval Command.\nIt also has a major helicopter maintenance depot providing accommodation and maintenance facilities for Westland Sea Kings, Kamov Ka 27s and HAL Chetaks, adding up to 17 helicopters and meeting a task of over 4000 flying hours annually.\n\n\n== Units ==\nNaval Air Squadrons based at INS Shikra include:\n\nINAS 321, a search and rescue and logistics squadron, operating HAL Chetak helicopters\nINAS 330, an anti-submarine warfare squadron, operating Westland Sea King Mk.42B helicopters\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndian navyList of Indian Navy bases\nList of active Indian Navy shipsIntegrated commands and unitsArmed Forces Special Operations Division\nDefence Cyber Agency\nIntegrated Defence Staff\nIntegrated Space Cell\nIndian Nuclear Command Authority\nIndian Armed Forces\nSpecial Forces of IndiaOther listsStrategic Forces Command\nList of Indian Air Force stations\nList of Indian Navy bases\nIndia's overseas military bases\n\n\n== References ==",

    "High-speed rail in Thailand": "\"High-speed rail in Thailand\" describes the realization for a high-speed rail network within Thailand, raised by the Thai Parliament in 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn October 2010, the Thai Parliament approved initial proposals for a high-speed rail (HSR) network. Five lines capable of handling 250 km/h speeds would radiate from Bangkok.In March 2013, the transport minister revealed that only one company would be selected to run all high-speed train routes, scheduled to be operational between 2018 and 2019. The first 86 km section from Bang Sue to Ayuthaya was planned to be tendered in late-2013. However, a seven month-long political crisis involving the dissolution of parliament and an annulled February 2014 election culminated in a military coup in May 2014. In July 2014 the new military junta deferred all HSR plans until a civilian government is installed.\nFollowing the military coup of May 2014 and his elevation to the office of prime minister, Gen Prayut Chan-o-cha proposed connecting Bangkok to two popular resort cities, Pattaya and Hua Hin, by high-speed rail. The Transport Ministry's Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning had earlier conducted studies on both routes. They assumed that, for the Bangkok-Pattaya line, trains would run through Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Pattaya, terminating in Rayong, a distance of 194 km. Construction costs were estimated at 152 billion baht with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 13%. Construction would take about 54 months. The route to Hua Hin would be 209 km in length with an investment cost of about 98 billion baht and EIRR of 8.1%. The office concluded that these routes would be of little interest to private investors due to the high investment required coupled with a low rate of return. Four HSR lines were included in fiscal year 2017 plans.\n\n\n== Proposed high-speed routes ==\n\n\n=== Northeastern HSR: Bangkok\u2013Nakhon Ratchasima\u2013Nong Khai (Sino-Thai railway project) ===\n\nIn November 2014, Thailand and China signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to construct the Thai portion of the transnational railway running from Kunming, China to the Gulf of Thailand. In November 2015, both parties agreed to a division of labour. Under the framework, a joint venture would be set up to run the project. China would conduct feasibility studies, design the system, construct tunnels and bridges, and lay track. Thailand would conduct social and environmental impact studies, expropriate land for construction, handle general civil engineering and power supply, and supply construction materials.\nOnce built, China would operate and maintain the system for the first three years of operation. Between the third and the seventh years, both countries would share responsibility. Later Thailand would take on responsibility with China as adviser. China would train Thai personnel to operate and maintain the system.\nDual standard-gauge tracks would be laid throughout the project. In Thailand, two routes would diverge at a junction in Kaeng Khoi District in Saraburi Province. One to connect Bangkok to Kaeng Khoi. The other route to connect Kaeng Khoi with Map Ta Phut of Rayong Province. From Kaeng Khoi tracks would lead north to Nakhon Ratchasima and on to Nong Khai Province. Construction would be divided into four sections: Bangkok-Kaeng Khoi, Map Ta Phut-Kaeng Khoi, Kaeng Khoi-Nakhon Ratchasima, Nakhon Ratchasima-Nong Khai.\nConstruction of Thailand's 873-kilometre-long portion of the railway system started in December 2017 The railway will connect to the 417 km Boten\u2013Vientiane railway and a 520 km line from the Lao border to Kunming. In July 2021, authorities said: \"works which will have to be postponed are the [... tracks] between Nawa Nakhon and Ban Pho, between Phra Kaeo and Saraburi\"; furthermore another postponement, \"presumably until [... 2022 is] the section between Don Muang and Nawa Nakhon\". The Phase 1 line is due to open in 2026.\n\n\n=== Eastern HSR: Bangkok\u2013U-Tapao Airport ===\n\nA HSR line to the eastern seaboard was first proposed in 1996 but there was no progress for over a decade. In 2009, the government requested the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and Planning (OTP) to create a plan for new HSR network in Thailand that included an eastern HSR line to Rayong. The route was finalised before the 2011 election with the promise to begin construction the next year if the government was re-elected, but they lost the election. After the 2011 election, the new government reviewed all HSR plans and the SRT stated that the line would be tendered in early-2014. After the May 2014 coup there were further delays while the military government reviewed all HSR lines, initially deferring all projects. In early-2016, the government agreed to proceed with the eastern HSR route and suggested that it could be extended to Don Mueang International Airport beyond the terminus at Bang Sue Grand Station thus providing a link with three airports. Extending the line would provide a link between Don Mueang Airport, Suvarnabhumi Airport, and U-Tapao International Airport in Ban Chang District.\nDuring 2017, OTP and the Ministry of Transport in consultation with the SRT agreed that by extending the line to terminate at Don Mueang it would effectively include the long delayed extension of the Airport Rail Link (Bangkok) from Makkasan Station to Don Mueang Airport as part of the project. The Eastern Economic Corridor Office (EEC Office) in October 2017 finalised previous OTP plans to build the 10 station Eastern HSR line linking Don Mueang airport, Bang Sue, Makkasan, Suvarnabhumi Airport, Chonburi, Si Racha, Pattaya, U-Tapao Airport, and Rayong. In early-2018, the section to Rayong was excluded due to environmental and safety concerns and it was decided that the line would terminate at U-Tapao Airport.The SRT stated that the first tenders for the Eastern HSR line are expected to be tendered by May 2018 with a four-month auction period before the contract is awarded. The cost of the project was estimated to be over 200 billion baht, of which the Thai Government would fund 123 billion baht and the private sector estimated to contribute 90 billion baht.Two rival consortia vied for the airport link contract. The Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group-led consortium consisting of Italian-Thai Development, China Railway Construction Corporation Ltd, CH. Karnchang, and Bangkok Expressway and Metro, won the project with a 224 billion baht bid in December 2018. Their winning bid is valid until 8 November 2019. Until 16 October 2019, the consortium had refused to sign the contract, citing land expropriation and eviction problems and the consortium's request that the government share the risk in the project. Negotiations were further complicated by the resignation of the entire board of the State Railway. On 16 October 2019, news reports announced that the CP consortium intends to sign the rail deal on 25 October. Tanit Sorat, Vice-Chairman of the Employers' Confederation of Thai Trade and Industry, said that the contract signing delays are, \"...unlikely to affect the project because the government will carry out the project smoothly.\" The project was eventually approved in October 2019 as a public private partnership between the Thai government and Charoen Pokphand/China Railway Construction Corporation. The assets will revert to state ownership after 50 years.\n\n\n=== Northern HSR: Bangkok\u2013Phitsanulok\u2013Chiang Mai (Japanese-Thai project) ===\nJapan would provide Shinkansen technology for a high-speed rail link between Bangkok and the northern city of Chiang Mai. Phase 1 would connect Bangkok to Phitsanulok. It is estimated to cost 280 billion baht. Seven stations are planned for this segment: Bang Sue, Don Mueang, Ayutthaya, Lopburi, Nakhon Sawan, Phichit, and Phitsanulok. To reduce costs, Thai authorities have proposed reducing the number of stations, but the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has rejected this suggestion on the grounds that it defeats the original purpose of the project. This portion of the route was scheduled to be submitted to the Thai cabinet for financial approval in August 2018.After an initial cooperation agreement was signed in 2015, the Thai government formally requested the technical and financial assistance of the Japanese government in late-2016 for the building of the Northern HSR line to Chiang Mai. The Japanese completed a feasibility study which estimated that the project will cost 420 billion baht to build.A feasibility study by JICA in mid-2018 reported that the train as planned would run at a loss. JICA's study projects only 10,000 passengers per day on the route, as opposed to the 30,000 per day forecasted in the original planning proposals. To be profitable from ticket sales would require 50,000 fares per day.The Thai government announced in September 2019 that it may cancel Bangkok-Chiang Mai high-speed rail project after private investors declined to invest. The cost of the 670 kilometre line is estimated to be 400 billion baht. Japan has turned down the project as a bad investment due to low passenger projections.\n\n\n=== Southern HSR: Bangkok\u2013Hua Hin ===\nThis line would link Bangkok with Hua Hin.

    "Metropolitan-Vickers": "Metropolitan-Vickers, Metrovick, or Metrovicks, was a British heavy electrical engineering company of the early-to-mid 20th century formerly known as British Westinghouse. Highly diversified, they were particularly well known for their industrial electrical equipment such as generators, steam turbines, switchgear, transformers, electronics and railway traction equipment. Metrovick holds a place in history as the builders of the first commercial transistor computer, the Metrovick 950, and the first British axial-flow jet engine, the Metropolitan-Vickers F.2. Their factory in Trafford Park, Manchester, was for most of the 20th century one of the biggest and most important heavy engineering facilities in Britain and the world.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMetrovick started as a way to separate the existing British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company factories from United States control, which had proven to be a hindrance to gaining government contracts during the First World War. In 1917 a holding company was formed to try to find financing to buy the company's properties.In May 1917, control of the holding company was obtained jointly by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company, of Birmingham, chaired by Dudley Docker, and Vickers Limited, of Barrow-in-Furness. On 15 March 1919, Docker agreed terms with Vickers, for Vickers to purchase all the shares of the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company for almost \u00a313 million. On 8 September 1919, Vickers changed the name of the British Westinghouse Electrical and Manufacturing Company to Metropolitan Vickers Electrical Company.The immediate post-war era was marked by low investment and continued labour unrest. Fortunes changed in 1926 with the formation of the Central Electricity Board which standardized electrical supply and led to a massive expansion of electrical distribution, installations, and appliance purchases. Sales shot up, and 1927 marked the company's best year to date.\nOn 15 November 1922 the BBC was registered and the BBC's Manchester station, 2ZY, was officially opened on 375 metres transmitting from the Metropolitan Vickers Electricity works in Old Trafford.\n\n\n=== BTH merger and transition to AEI ===\n\nIn 1928 Metrovick merged with the rival British Thomson-Houston (BTH), a company of similar size and basically the same product lineup. Combined, they would be one of the few companies able to compete with Marconi or English Electric on an equal footing. In fact the merger was marked by poor communication and intense rivalry, and the two companies generally worked at cross purposes.\nThe next year the combined company was purchased by the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) holding group, who also owned Edison Swan (Ediswan); and Ferguson, Pailin & Co, manufacturers of electrical switchgear in Openshaw, Manchester. The rivalry between Metrovick and BTH continued, and AEI was never able to exert effective control over the two competing subsidiary companies.\nProblems worsened in 1929 with the start of the great depression, but Metrovick's overseas sales were able to pick up some of the slack, notably a major railway electrification project in Brazil. By 1933 world trade was growing again, but growth was nearly upset when six Metrovick engineers were arrested and found guilty of espionage and \"wrecking\" in Moscow after a number of turbines built by the company in and for the Soviet Union proved to be faulty. The British government intervened; the engineers were released and trade with Russia was resumed after a brief embargo.\n\nDuring the 1930s Metropolitan Vickers produced two dozen very large diameter (3m/10 ft) three-phase AC traction motors for the Hungarian railway's V40 and V60 electric locomotives. The 1640 kW rated power machinery, designed by K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Kand\u00f3, was paid for by British government economic aid.\nIn 1935 the company built a 105 MW steam turbogenerator, the largest in Europe at that time, for the Battersea Power Station.In 1936 Metrovick started work with the Air Ministry on automatic pilot systems, eventually branching out to gunlaying systems and building radars the next year. In 1938 they reached an agreement with the Ministry to build a turboprop design developed at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) under the direction of Hayne Constant. It is somewhat ironic that BTH, their erstwhile partners, were at the same time working with Frank Whittle on his pioneering jet designs.\n\n\n=== Wartime aircraft production ===\n\nIn mid-1938, MV's were given a contract to build Avro Manchester twin-engined heavy bombers under licence from A.V. Roe. As this type of work was very different from their traditional heavy engineering activities, a new factory was built on the western side of Mosley Road and this was completed in stages through 1940.  There were significant problems producing this aircraft, not least being the unreliability of the Rolls-Royce Vulture engine and that the first 13 Manchesters were destroyed in a Luftwaffe bombing raid on Trafford Park on 23 December. Despite this the firm went on to complete 43 examples. With the design of the much improved four-engined derivative, the Avro Lancaster, MV switched production to that famous type, supplied with Rolls-Royce Merlin engines from the Ford Trafford Park shadow factory. Three hangars were erected on the southside of Manchester's Ringway Airport for assembly and testing of their Lancasters, before a policy switch was made to assembling them in a hangar at Avro's Woodford airfield. By the end of the war, MV's had built 1,080 Lancasters. These were followed by 79 Avro Lincoln derivatives before remaining orders were cancelled and MV's aircraft production ceased in December 1945.\nIn 1940 the turboprop effort was re-engineered as a pure jet engine after the successful run of Whittle's designs. The new design became the Metrovick F.2 and eventually flew in 1943 on a Gloster Meteor. Considered to be too complex to bother with, Metrovick then re-engineered the design once again to produce roughly double the power, while at the same time starting work on a much larger design, the Metrovick F.9 Sapphire. Although the F.9 proved to be a winner, the Ministry of Supply nevertheless forced the company to sell the jet division to Armstrong Siddeley in 1947 to reduce the number of companies in the business.\nIn addition to building aircraft, other wartime work included the manufacture of both Dowty and Messier undercarriages, automatic pilot units, searchlights and radar equipment. They also produced electric vans and lorries.\n\n\n=== Metrovicks postwar ===\n\nThe post-war era led to massive demand for electrical systems, leading to additional rivalries between Metrovick and BTH as each attempted to one-up the other in delivering ever-larger turbogenerator contracts. Metrovick also expanded their appliance division during this time, becoming a well known supplier of refrigerators and stoves.\nThe design and manufacture of sophisticated scientific instruments, such as electron microscopes, and mass spectrometers, became an important area of scientific research for the company.\nIn 1947, a Metrovick G.1 Gatric gas turbine was fitted to the Motor Gun Boat MGB 2009, making it the world's first gas turbine powered naval vessel. A subsequent marine gas turbine engine was the G.2 of 4,500 shp fitted to the Royal Navy Bold-class fast patrol boats Bold Pioneer and Bold Pathfinder, which were built in 1953.The Bluebird K7 jet-propelled 3-point hydroplane in which Donald Campbell broke the 200 mph water speed barrier was powered with a Metropolitan-Vickers Beryl jet engine producing 3,500 lbf (16 kN) of thrust. The K7 was unveiled in late 1954. Campbell succeeded on Ullswater on 23 July 1955, where he set a record of 202.15 mph (325.33 km/h), beating the previous record by some 24 mph (39 km/h) held by Stanley Sayres.\nAnother major area of expansion was in the diesel locomotive market, where they combined their own generators and traction motors, with third-party diesel engines to develop in 1950 the WAGR X class 2-Do-2 locomotive and in 1958 the type 2 Co-Bo, later re-classified under the TOPS system as the British Rail Class 28. This diesel-electric locomotive was unusual on two counts; its Co-Bo wheel arrangement and its Crossley 2-Stroke diesel engine (evolved from a World War II marine engine). Intended as part the British Railways Modernisation Plan, the twenty-strong fleet saw service between Scotland and England before being deemed unsuccessful and withdrawn towards the end of the 1960s. Metrovick also produced the CIE 001 Class (originally 'A' Class) from 1955, the first production mainline diesels in Ireland.\nMetropolitan Vickers also produced electrical equipment for the British Rail Class 76 (EM1), and British Rail Class 77 (EM2), 1.5 kV DC locomotives, built at Gorton Works for the electrification of the Woodhead Line in the early 1950s. Larger but broadly similar locomotives were also supplied to the NSWGR as their 46 class. The company also designed the British Rail Class 82, 25 kV AC locomotives built by Beyer Peacock in Manchester using Metrovick electrical equipment. The company also supplied electrical equipment for the British Rail Class 303 \"Blue Train\" electric multiple units.\nIn the 1950s, the company built a large power transformer works at Wythenshawe, Manchester. The factory opened in 1957, and was closed by GEC in 1971, after which it was sold to the American compressor manufacturer Ingersoll Rand.\nIn 1961, the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was invited to the company's factory at Trafford Park as part of his tour of Manchester.The rivalry between Metrovick and BTH was eventually ended in an unconvincing fashion when the AEI management eventually decided to rid themselves of both brands and be known as AEI universally, a change they made on 1 January 1960. This move was almost universally resented within both companies. Worse, the new brand name was utterly unknown to their customers, leading to a noticeable fall-off in sales and AEI's stock price.\n\n\n=== General Electric Company (GEC) takeover ===\nWhen AEI attempted to remove the doubled-up management structures, they found this task to be even more difficult.  By the mid-1960s the company was struggling under the weight of two complete management hierarchies, and they appeared to be unable to control the company any more.  This allowed AEI to be purchased by General Electric Company in 1967, which was later restructured into many other companies, including Marconi plc in 1999, later Marconi Corporation plc, and others.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCategory:Metropolitan-Vickers locomotives\nBowesfield Works\nMetro-Vickers Affair\nMetrovick electric vehicles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nScott, J.D.

    "Hayford Peirce": "Hayford Peirce (January 7, 1942 \u2013 November 19, 2020) was an American writer of science fiction, mysteries, and spy thrillers. He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and received his BA from Harvard College.  He wrote numerous short stories for the science-fiction magazines Analog, Galaxy, and Omni, as well as mystery shorts for Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine and Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. Most of his stories are light-hearted and satiric in tone, with elements of black humor and occasional surprising grimness.The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction says that \"he established a name for lightly written tales whose backgrounds were unusually well conceived.\"\n\n\n== Biography ==\nPeirce was raised in a family of wealthy timber-land owners who were both cultivated and eccentric.  His father, also named Hayford, a recognized authority on Byzantine art, wrote several books on the subject in French. His mother, Polly, was a would-be playwright and summer playhouse owner. His uncle, Waldo Peirce, was a painter and bohemian character.  Peirce attended, with no great distinction, Exeter, Stanford, and Harvard.  At age 22 he married a Tahitian girl and moved to Tahiti, where he lived for the next 23 years.  At various times he was a part owner, and sometimes accountant, for a mother-of-pearl button factory, a garden center, a one-hour laundry, and an import business.Peirce began writing in 1974, with the sale of \"Unlimited Warfare\" a science-fiction short story to Analog magazine. The story is typical of the fairly short, somewhat sardonic, black-humored stories that he wrote for a number of years.  It takes an unlikely premise\u2014England wages an undeclared war upon France by destroying its vineyards, while France retaliates and ultimately wins the war by destroying the world's tea supply\u2014and treats it with an apparently deadpan yet whimsical manner.  The writing is clear and direct, modeled on that of his favorite author, Evelyn Waugh, with occasional jaunty overtones of P.G. Wodehouse and Raymond Chandler.In 2017, The Motley Fool published a financial article describing how Peirce became a \"dividend millionaire\" by investing in high-dividend stocks over a 22-year period.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOn November 19, 2020, Peirce was found in critical condition at his home in Tucson, Arizona, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound; his wife, Wanda Zhang Peirce, was found dead at the scene in \"a possible murder suicide\", according to police. Peirce was hospitalized, and subsequently died. His wife is the former owner of Wanda Z's Chinese, a restaurant in Oro Valley.\n\n\n== Writing career ==\nHe wrote a number of science-fiction and mystery novels, some of which were published by Tor, and the others by Wildside Press. They have been translated into several languages. Typical of them are Napoleon Disentimed and Blood on the Hibiscus.  His one spy thriller, written in London in 1968 at the height of the fictional spy mania, was The Bel Air Blitz.\nMany of Peirce's short stories concern on-going protagonists.  In the science fiction field there have been collections of his Chap Foey Rider, Capitalist to the Stars stories, of his Jonathan White, Stockbroker in Orbit stories, and of his Sam Fearon, Time Scanner stories.  In the mystery field, he has had two collections about protagonists living in Tahiti, Commissaire Tama, a chief of police, and Joe Caneili, a private eye.\nPeirce also collaborated with David M.

    "Compressed air foam system": "A compressed air foam system (CAFS) is used in firefighting to deliver fire retardant foam for the purpose of extinguishing a fire or protecting unburned areas.\nTypical components include a water source, a centrifugal pump, foam concentrate tanks, a direct-injection foam proportioning system on the discharge side of the pump, a mixing chamber or device, a rotary air compressor, and control systems to ensure the correct mixes of concentrate, water, and air. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nA compressed air foam system is defined as a standard water pumping system that has an entry point where compressed air can be added to a foam solution to generate foam. The air compressor also provides energy, which, gallon for gallon, propels compressed air foam farther than aspirated or standard water nozzles. \nIt is proven that CAFS attacks all three sides of the fire triangle simultaneously. The foam blankets the fuel, thereby reducing the fuel\u2019s capacity to seek out a source of oxygen. The CAFS solution adheres to ceilings and walls, more readily aiding in rapid reduction in heat. Also, the opaque surfaces of the foam, as it adheres to walls and ceilings, shield the fuel source from radiant energy. (Brooks, 2005; Brooks, 2006) - Later disproven in NIST Study, see below.\nCAFS may also refer to any pressurized water style extinguisher that is charged with foam and pressurized with compressed air.\nIt has later been proven, that CAFS is no more effective at extinguishing fires than regular water and may actually be detrimental to interior attacks. It also had the habit of burning firefighters during offensive interior operations due to introducing air (part of the fire tetrahedron) and generating more steam when attempting to combat initial fires. \n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea that water is not a perfect tool for fire extinguishment has been long noted, as by W. E. Clark (1991), \"The process of extinguishing fire by water is cumbersome and generally costly \u2026 the cost of installing water mains large enough for required flow, the installation and maintenance of fire hydrants, and the acquisition and maintenance of fire department pumpers, fire hose, and nozzles, make water a fairly expensive extinguishing agent \u2026 the use of water is hardly the ideal way to extinguish fire \u2026 there must be a better method waiting to be discovered.\" (p. 75)\nLiebson (1996) adds, \"Water is an inefficient extinguishing agent. It requires the use of large quantities at costs both financial and physical. These costs are imposed on the firefighter and the community.\" (p. 5)\nThe use of foam additives to water for extinguishment dates back to an English patent in 1877 for a method to produce chemical foam (Liebson, 1991, p. xi). The Royal Navy experimented with agents foamed by means of compressed air in the 1930s (Darley, 1994) and the United States Navy was using compressed air foam systems (CAFS) in the 1940s for flammable liquid fires. By the 1960s do-it-yourself car washes were using CAFS with low pressure and small-diameter hoses and nozzles, which flowed about 4 US gallons (15 L) per minute of solution and 4 cubic feet (0.11 m3) per minute of compressed air, with a nozzle reach of about 40 feet (12 m)   (Rochna and Schlobohm, 1992).\nIn the mid 1970s Mark Cummins, while working for the Texas Forest Service, developed a water expansion system known as the Texas Snow Job. Mr. Cummins invented the CAFS and was issued the US Patent 4318443 in 1982. This pioneering Class A CAFS used dish-washing detergents or a pine soap derivative, which was readily available as waste from local paper manufacturing industries, as a foaming agent mixed as 8 to 9 parts agent to 91 to 92 parts water, flowing up to 30 US gal (110 L) per minute. The duration was limited by the use of compressed air cylinders rather than compressors (The US and foreign patent issued to Mark Cummins also included all types of air compressors and inert gas generators). By the mid-1980s, research by the United States Bureau of Land Management in co-operation with Mark Cummins, led to modern design features of rotary air compressors, centrifugal pumps, and direct-injection foam-proportioning systems (Fornell, 1991; IFSTA, 1966). CAFS received national attention in 1988 during the Yellowstone Park wildfires when the four-story Old Faithful Inn was successfully protected by blanketing it with compressed air foam (Darley, 1994).\nIn the spring of 1994, a compressed air foam demonstration vehicle manufactured by W.S. Darley & Co., was driven from coast to coast in North America by Troy Carothers. The purpose was to spread the word about CAFS and display this relatively new technology to United States and Canadian firefighting services. Many years earlier Darley Co. teamed up with Cummins on the WEPS (water expansion pumping system) demonstration vehicle. The 1994 Darley demo vehicle was operated by Troy Carothers who was involved with the initial design and assembly of the Darley AutoCAFS product. Carothers is now the Darley AutoCAFS Manager and oversees all aspects of CAFS development for Darley Co. This demonstration vehicle concept has continued annually since 1994.\n\n\n== Foam types ==\nCAFS is able to deliver a range of useful foam consistencies, labeled from type 1 (very dry) to type 5 (wet), which are controlled by the air-to-solution ratio, and, to a lesser extent, by the concentrate-to-water percentage. Type 1 and 2 foams have long drain times, meaning the bubbles do not burst and give up their water quickly, and long duration. Wet foams, such as type 4 and 5, drain more quickly in the presence of heat. \nA major advantage of using CAFS is having the unique ability to produce a wide range of foam qualities or foam types to provide the most appropriate foam response to individual fire situations. This gives the fire officer the advantage of custom tailoring the best foam type for the tactical use and fire problem at hand..\nAfter testing a dry type 2 foam in several situations, Johnny Murdock notes, \"The emerging consensus is that the dryer foams (type II; maybe type I) should be used to suppress vapors, protect unburned structures, build wildland fire lines involving unburned fuels; \u2026 and that structural fire suppression requires a wetter foam (type IV or type V); and that both structural and wildland overhaul require type V foam.\"\nFor structural firefighting with compressed air foam, Dominic Colletti recommends utilizing a 0.5 cubic feet (0.014 m3) per minute to 1 US gal (3.8 L) per minute \"air to foam solution\" ratio, with a 0.5% class A foam proportioning rate. This would produce flow rates from a typical 1-3/4\" inch hose of 120 US gal (450 L) per minute of foam solution and 60 cu ft (1.7 m3) per minute of compressed air. This air to foam solution ratio produces a wet, quick draining finished foam that will quickly knockdown flame and reduce fire compartment temperature. This ratio also allows for a higher relative foam solution (liquid) flow rate to help maintain the highest levels of firefighter safety possible. (The Compressed Air Foam Systems Handbook, Colletti 2005.) \nWhile Colletti's claims for flows are not agreed upon by many industry experts, as exhibited at the CAFS symposium held in Rosenberg, Texas in February 2007. A panel there agreed that flows of 1 US gal (3.8 L) per minute foam solution in tandem with 1 cu ft (0.028 m3) per minute air produce the most effective blanket. It was further agreed that the maximum combination of air flow mixed with foam solution flow out of a 1-3/4\" line under normal pump pressures of 100\u2013125 PSI could not physically exceed a total of 140\u2013150. In other words, the simultaneous flow of 70 cu ft (2.0 m3) per minute of air and 70 US gal (260 L) per minute of water is approaching the maximum limit or carrying capacity of that diameter hose (1.75 inches). (Texas CAFS Symposium February, 2007)\n\n\n== Water can conversion ==\nAir pressurized water (APW) fire extinguishers are commonly converted into makeshift CAFS extinguishers by drilling two 1/8-1/16 inch holes in the pickup tube above the water line. The unit is then filled with 1.5 US gallons (5.7 L) of water and class A foam, AFFF, FFFP or commercial detergent is added to the water in a 1% ratio for class A fires and a 3%-6% ratio for class B fires. Typically, the tip of the smooth-bore application nozzle is then cut off to allow the foam to properly expand. Keeping the nozzle will result in wetter foam but longer range. Cutting the nozzle will result in an expanded, dry foam but will lack the range of the standard water nozzle. CAFS extinguishers can also be fitted with air aspirators, commonly used on AFFF and FFFP foam extinguishers, which will result in a more expanded foam but will lack the heat resistance of non-aspirated foam, which does not break the bubbles.\n\n\n== Problems ==\nOn 17 December 2005 two firefighters from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, died inside a burning building when one of the hoses inside the building burst and they were left without extinguishing agent. In the following reconstruction of the tragedy, experts were surprised to find out that CAFS filled hoses are more likely to burst under heat because the foam is unable to cool the hoses sufficiently.Some fire district engines have experienced that CAFS filled hoses have a higher incidence of clogging and decrease in pressure.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nTechnical Report 98: Compressed Air Foam Systems in Limited Staffing Conditions \u2014 United States Fire Administration, Department of Homeland Security, United States Government\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) - Forschungsstelle f\u00fcr Brandschutztechnik: Research reports No. 140, No. 150  \u2014 [see also the presentation: https://www.ffb.kit.edu/download/DLS2003.pdf]\nAustralian Bushfire CRC - Using CAF for Grassland Fires (ACT RFS)",

More accurately described as a plateau than a true mountain range, they form the eastern boundary of the Cockpit Country. This is also the mountain that people used to go and pray.  The Dry Harbour Mountains starts from Discovery Bay, St. Ann and covers most settlements all the way to the eastern end of the Cockpit Country. It is a mountain which abounds in limestone and bauxite. The soil type is latosol which is of red iron and aluminium oxide.\nThe Dry Harbour Mountains is some 2,200 feet above sea level and many areas are very cool. The area is covered in rich verdant pastures and numerous trees. In many areas the wet limestone forest is a riotous profuse of trees.  Many prominent districts are part of this plateau region of Jamaica.

    "Intellectual courage": "Intellectual courage falls under the family of philosophical intellectual virtues, which stems from an individual's own doxastic logic.Broadly differentiated from physical courage, intellectual courage refers to the cognitive risks strongly tied with an individual's personality traits and willpower, so as to say an individual's quality of mind. Branches include (but not exclusive to): Intellectual humility, Intellectual responsibility, Intellectual honesty, Intellectual perseverance, Intellectual empathy, Intellectual integrity and Intellectual fair-mindedness.Existing under numerous different definitions, intellectual courage is prevalent in everyone, and is often dependent on the context and/or situation it falls under. As such, famous classical philosophers such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, have studied and observed the importance of this virtue to a great extent, so as to understand and grasp the impacts of intellectual courage on the human mind.Over the years and generations of observation and debate, intellectual courage has developed different interpretations, largely influenced by the writings of philosophers, changes in culture and shifts in societal norms.The opposite of achieving intellectual courage is referred to as intellectual arrogance.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIt is believed that intellectual courage itself, by nature does not often undergo any changes. In fact, it is the understanding by those who study and learn of it, together with the influence of ever-changing cultures, that defines the gaps between the different interpretations.Although very much related to its parent term, courage, intellectual courage ventures in deeper towards ensuring that an action any person may take, is aligned with the unwavering rational beliefs that that said person holds. On a daily basis, many emotions such as fear and desire easily influence decisions. The degree to which a person is able to control or give in to such emotions, determines the strength of one's intellectual courage.\nA concise interpretation of intellectual courage is as quoted below, Intellectual courage may be defined as having a consciousness of the need to face and fairly address ideas, beliefs or viewpoints toward which one has strong negative emotions and to which one has not given a serious hearing. Intellectual courage is connected to the recognition that ideas that society considers dangerous or absurd are sometimes rationally justified (in whole or in part). Conclusions and beliefs inculcated in people are sometimes false or misleading. To determine for oneself what makes sense, one must not passively and uncritically accept what one has learned. Intellectual courage comes into play here because there is some truth in some ideas considered dangerous and absurd, and distortion or falsity in some ideas held strongly by social groups to which we belong. People need courage to be fair-minded thinkers in these circumstances. The penalties for nonconformity can be severe.\nAs follows, there are many more interpretations of intellectual courage.First, a more common interpretation is to conceptualise intellectual courage as a component in the family of courage, together with social courage and physical courage.On the other hand, the execution of cognitive thoughts mostly require the combined involvement of not only the intellectual courage as discussed above, but also the extension of moral courage, and philosophical courage, to eventually turn into cognitive actions.It has also been said that intellectual courage serves as a \"character strength\", along with other personality aspects such as self-generated curiosity and open-mindedness.The development is said to be a highly iterative process, stemmed from the collective and ongoing influence of daily happenings and exposure, such as one's social surroundings and environment. As such, these traits are very implicitly formed, and explains the varying degrees of intellectual courage present in each and every individual.\n\n\n== Manifestation ==\nVirtues have been a topic at hand for philosophers from all over the globe, dating back to as far as the Middle Ages.Although the birth of intellectual virtues specifically, come shortly after, the foundational layer of interpretations can be traced all the way to ancient Roman, Greek and Latin philosophical theories and traditions, with even religions such as Buddhism having their own take and perspective on specific virtues, and what classifies as a virtue. History has proven time and time again that courage does not always take form in its physical and common connotation, but also in its cognitive form, being an attribute that one can possess, as a \"courageous thinker\".Ryan, A. claims that intellectual courage is also widely used and present in political situations. This occurs when one demonstrates the notion of sticking with one's proclamation, despite being exposed to unreasonable and counter intuitive influence that is usually filled with non-aligning agendas sprouting from other political parties. The demonstration of intellectual courage in this sense is highly sought after as a leader and is often followed by new found heights of respect from people.A more casual day to day situation in which an individual's intellectual courage would arise in, is when contemplation between more than two pathways are present, and the usage of knowledge and reasoning is crucial. Many aspects and foreseeable situations must then be carefully assessed to confidently single out the best possible route. This can then be backed up and weighed upon factors such as the chosen option being one of either the most ethical, the most logical, the most reasonable, or the most beneficial to the individual.Intellectual courage is highly compared and dependent on a person's self-reliance.\n\n\n== Teachings of Intellectual Courage ==\nAt present, there is still a withstanding lack of awareness in regards to the vitalness of intellectual courage, to complement the journey of an individual's growth. Many philosophical writers have identified the rising need for intellectual virtues such as intellectual courage, to be taught in education systems as part of expanding the knowledge in mind.Intellectual courage serves as one of the most important personal traits that encourages life-long learning, a mindset that is promoted in most educational institutions.Paul, R. criticises most of the present schooling systems starting from elementary school all the way up until college and tertiary education, as institutions that educate students for years without endowing any form of intellectual virtues upon students at the end when they leave. An example of this would be that students can easily become high achievers in school by memorising concepts and taking notes religiously, yet do not truly understand the underlying reasonings behind each concept, and thus would not understand the usefulness and applications outside the education system.He also believes that the inclusion of this criteria and the possible implementation of teaching intellectual values in the future will henceforth change the parameters of conventional determinants of success and failure in the learning space.Nordby, S., who holds a philosophy PhD from the University of Oklahoma, also speaks up about the importance of integrating intellectual courage into the minds of thinkers. She states, \"when done with parity, it can keep disciplines from becoming insular and reduce the number of echo chambers in academia\".Intellectual courage is part of the mix towards a \"disciplined mind\" including the other traits: Intellectual integrity, Intellectual humility, Intellectual sense of justice, Intellectual perseverance, Intellectual fair-mindedness, Intellectual confidence in reason, Intellectual empathy and Intellectual autonomy.With the collective presence of these traits, not only will the individual ultimately achieve higher critical skills, but also higher quality of thought and higher order of thinking.The opposite of achieving intellectual courage is often referred to as intellectual arrogance, which induces weak critical thinking.A common scenario for intellectual arrogance to arise, is during the process of taking in what Paul, R. describes as \"superficially absorbed content\" which inevitably stems from \"shallow coverage\" education.This inhibits the parameters of which an individual would think, because not only does it hinder open-mindedness towards new and unconventional problems, but it also hinders the willingness to take risks in new ventures, which as a result, opts the individual to stay within the boundaries of norms and safety nets instead, allowing for very little room for growth.\n\n\n== History in Greek Philosophy ==\nMany great philosophers of all times such as Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, have all touched up upon intellectual courage through discussion of the larger picture, intellectual virtues.Aristotle is a well known figure in Greek philosophy who has extensively written on virtues such as intellectual courage in his books, Eudemian Ethics and Nicomachean Ethics. As Ryan, A. writes, Aristotle defines courage as \"the virtue that occupies a mean between cowardice and recklessness\".Although initially insinuating the physical and literal conception of courage, Aristotle does not exclude the discussion of the terminology in the less straightforward sense.\nAristotle makes a connection for morality and intellectual virtues in being collectively exhaustive, in order to achieve the fulfilment of reading a situation to the best of abilities and thus coming to a sound and righteous conclusion. The act of displaying intellectual courage in this sense, would be to stand one's ground in the situation where in a conflict of interest arises. This will in turn, result in an expense or an opportunity cost, inducing a vital decision making road block (a drawback is present), in choosing the most righteous and moral conclusion.\n\nPlato, a philosopher who is famously known for his work on the Republic, has also extensively written and discussed the virtues of courage, including intellectual courage in his early written works. Devereux, D. claims that Plato has even gone as far as to \"single out courage for special treatment\". Plato compares a shortfall of intellectual courage as a prevalence of simply a \"weakness of will\".Socrates too, is a classical Greek philosopher, known for manifesting the Socratic irony and the Socratic method. Prior to Socrates' written views on intellectual courage, Schmid, W. states that there were predominantly two conventional interpretations of courage in Ancient Greece.The first conception was that derived from a military point of view, with the \"greatest literacy representatives\" being ancient heroes such as Achilles, Diomedes and Hector.The second conception came into realisation as the Greek society's perception and stage on warfare shifted, leading up to courage being defined as \"the willingness of the citizen-soldier to stand and fight in the battle line\".Being defined entirely in forms of the physical courage during early times, the introduction towards intellectual courage in the mind came much later, where it was used to describe the cognitive thoughts of the warriors.\n\n\n== Role in Mathematical Creativity ==\nThis section is purely to define intellectual courage in the perspective of mathematicians, and aims to demonstrate the underlying relationship between one's intellectual courage in contrast to their respective mathematical creativity.In reference to Hadar, N. and Kleiner, I.'s 20 year long research, it has been shown that academic privilege is in fact, not the only factor that contributes to the minds of mathematically talented students. This is seen from delving deeper into not just the end results that mathematicians establish, but the actual process and the emotional investment that is put into each practice.While personal traits and characteristics such as curiosity and the amount of passion and drive one possesses have widely been discussed among the community to be additional contributing factors, intellectual courage, proved to play a crucial and notable role in the success of mathematicians as well. Although a drawback from this study would be the complexity of obtaining and quantifying the emotional and intangible efforts put into the events that eventually lead up to the assertion of new findings, Hadar and Kleiner have ensured that the methods of data collection they have sought after and utilised, will provide a sound and accurate result and representation of the study.The act of intellectual courage in this perspective entails 4 main key drivers: persistence, self-confidence, insight and motivation.With all these drivers co-existing, intellectual courage will come into play at the time when an individual experiences a situation that is coupled with the presence of risk and the uncertainty of a finish line. In other words, it is simply to take the risk of putting in an ample amount of time and resource into something that may lead to nothing.Being aware that there are two possible outcomes for the investment of effort put into said experience, and accepting that their efforts may go unrewarded, is what mathematicians describe as taking a leap with intellectual courage.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Monongah, West Virginia": "Monongah is a town in Marion County, West Virginia, United States, situated where Booths Creek flows into the West Fork River. The population was 1,044 at the 2010 census. Monongah was chartered in 1891, based on Chapter 47 of West Virginia code. Its name is derived from the nearby Monongahela River.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Adena and Hopewell peoples dwelt in what is now northern West Virginia 1,500\u20132,000+ years ago. By the time of the early European traders and settlers, the native population is thought to have been nil, decimated by the Beaver Wars.Monongah was known as Briar Town and was part of the Grant Magisterial District in 1886.It was later known as Camdensburg, named after Johnson N. Camden, United States Senator from West Virginia (1881\u20131887). The Protestant Episcopal Church at Camdensburg described Camdensburg in 1889 as \"a new mining and coking town which promises to be a place of some importance in a few years.\"Monongah was chartered in 1891 under Chapter 47 of West Virginia code, Of Cities, Towns, and Villages, Incorporation of Without Special Charter; Amending Charter Where Population Less Than Two Thousand.\n\n\n=== Monongah mining disaster ===\n\nMonongah suffered the loss of all 358 miners underground and an engineer on the surface when Fairmont Coal Company Mines No 6 and No 8 exploded at 10:30 am on December 6, 1907. The dead consisted of 171 Italians, 85 Americans, 52 Hungarians, 31 Russians, 15 Austrians, and 5 Turks. Three more people died in the aftermath, yielding a total of 361 victims. This mining accident left approximately 250 widows and 1,000 fatherless children.Mayor W.H. Moore, along with D.F. Morris, William Gaskins, and John Boydoh served on the Monongah Relief Committee, formed soon after to help manage the aid effort. Mayor Moore headed the Monongah Mines Relief Committee after Monongah and Fairmont decided to merge their committees into a joint effort.Memorials were erected in the center of town to recognize the centennial of the mining disaster on December 7, 2007. One memorial, titled Monongah Heroine, consists of a statue of a mother holding a baby with a young child beside her. It is dedicated to the widows and mothers of the miners who died. The inspiration for the statue is reported to have come from Catarina Davia, a woman widowed by the disaster. Feeling betrayed by the coal company for lack of compensation after her husband's death she vowed to make the 1.3 mile trek from her home to the mine to steal a satchel of coal every day until she died. She didn't only do this once every day but she did it twice. Her house was still standing until an accidental fire burned the house down on September 10, 2010. A second memorial, consisting of an engraved metal bell and plaque, was placed by the Italians to recognize the many victims from Molise in southern Italy.Father Everett Francis Briggs, a Roman Catholic missionary of the  Maryknoll order, oversaw the memorial project and died just a few days after its completion. On February 21, 2002, the West Virginia Legislature (House Concurrent Resolution no. 40) resolved \"to name the bridge which traverses the West Fork River in Marion County, located .12 miles west of county route 27/2, the Father Everett Francis Briggs Bridge\", in honor of Briggs' dedication to the forgotten victims of the 1907 tragedy and the mine widows.\n\n\n== Commerce, industry and media ==\nFairmont Coal Company, of Fairmont, West Virginia, bought 36 mines in June 1901, including six mines of the Monongah Company.The town's local cement block factory went out of business in 2002 and was torn down in 2003.The broadcast tower for the Fairmont AM radio station, WMMN, was constructed in the middle 1930s atop Tower Hill in Monongah.The town is featured in the post-apocalyptic video game Fallout 76.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMonongah High School was merged with the public high school populations of Mannington, Barrackville, and Fairview, West Virginia in 1979 to form North Marion High School, located in Farmington, West Virginia. North Marion was constructed to replace Farmington High School, which closed in 1975.\nThe Saints Peter and Paul School was a K-8 parochial school operated in Monongah by the Sisters Auxiliaries of the Apostolate Society, a Roman Catholic society of apostolic life founded in Wheeling, West Virginia on December 15, 1937 and terminated August 26, 2013.

These include East Monongah, Brookdale, Traction Park, Thoburn, Tower Hill and West Monongah. Prior to being incorporated and named \"Monongah,\" the town was called \"Briartown.\" It is often considered to be the unofficial capital of small coal mining towns.\nNot only does the West Fork (of the Monongahela River) run through the middle of Monongah but Booths Creek (named for Continental Army James Booth, who was killed by Indians in 1778) joins the West Fork in Monongah.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 1,044 people, 457 households, and 301 families living in the town.

Green, who had been limited to 113 first-team minutes all season, denied the report and the club press officer said he would play with HSV II \"a couple times when he is not in the first-team squad\" to get more game action and match fitness, but that he was still training with the first team.\n\n\n==== Return to Bayern ====\nOn August 20, 2015, Green was demoted to FC Bayern Munich II. He made his first appearance of the season the next day, playing right back against SV Schalding-Heining. On October 23, he scored a hat-trick against FC Augsburg II.

During the second game of their U.S. tour, Green scored a hat-trick in the first 35 minutes, helping Munich to a 4\u20131 win over Inter Milan. Following an international break in which Green scored two goals in two successive matches, Ancelotti hinted that the player could be receiving a \"chance to play in the next few games\". That chance came on October 26, 2016, when Green scored his first competitive goal for Bayern, coming against FC Augsburg in a 3\u20131 victory in the second round of the DFB-Pokal, making him the first American to score for the club.

Instead he joined the German U19 team for a friendly against France.\n\n\n=== U.S. men's team ===\nGreen trained with the United States ahead of their match against Ukraine on March 5, 2014, and filed for a one-time switch to play for the country on March 18. \nPrior to his senior international appearance, Green played internationally for Germany and the United States at various youth levels due to having dual citizenship.\nExplaining his decision to play for the United States, Green said, \"I was born in Florida and my father still lives there, so I have deep roots in the U.S. I'm very proud to be representing the United States.\" On March 24, FIFA approved Green's change of nationality, making him eligible to play in games for the United States. Two days later, he received his first call up for the senior national team for a friendly in April against Mexico, and made his debut in the second half of the 2\u20132 draw at the University of Phoenix Stadium.Green was selected as a part of the United States men's national team on May 12, 2014, to train for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.

    "The Book of the City of Ladies": "The Book of the City of Ladies or Le Livre de la Cit\u00e9 des Dames  (finished by 1405), is perhaps Christine de Pizan's most famous literary work, and it is her second work of lengthy prose. Pizan uses the vernacular French language to compose the book, but she often uses Latin-style syntax and conventions within her French prose. The book serves as her formal response to Jean de Meun's popular Roman de la Rose. Pizan combats Meun's statements about women by creating an allegorical city of ladies. She defends women by collecting a wide array of famous women throughout history. These women are \"housed\" in the City of Ladies, which is actually the book. As Pizan builds her city, she uses each famous woman as a building block for not only the walls and houses of the city, but also as building blocks for her thesis. Each woman added to the city adds to Pizan's argument towards women as valued participants in society. She also advocates in favour of education for women.Christine de Pizan also finished by 1405 The Treasure of the City of Ladies (Le tresor de la cit\u00e9 des dames de degr\u00e9 en degr\u00e9, also known The Book of the Three Virtues), a manual of education, dedicated to Princess Margaret of Burgundy. This aims to educate women of all estates, the latter telling women who have husbands: \"If she wants to act prudently and have the praise of both the world and her husband, she will be cheerful to him all the time\". Her Book and Treasure are her two best-known works, along with the Ditie de Jehanne D'Arc.\n\n\n== Summary ==\n\n\n=== Part I ===\nPart I opens with Christine reading from Matheolus's Lamentations, a work from the thirteenth century that addresses marriage wherein the author writes that women make men's lives miserable. Upon reading these words, Christine becomes upset and feels ashamed to be a woman: \"This thought inspired such a great sense of disgust and sadness in me that I began to despise myself and the whole of my sex as an aberration in nature\". The three Virtues then appear to Christine, and each lady tells Christine what her role will be in helping her build the City of Ladies. Lady Reason, a virtue developed by Christine for the purpose of her book, is the first to join Christine and helps her build the external walls of the city. She answers Christine's questions about why some men slander women, helping Christine to prepare the ground on which the city will be built. She tells Christine to \"take the spade of [her] intelligence and dig deep to make a trench all around [the city] \u2026 [and Reason will] help to carry away the hods of earth on [her] shoulders.\"  These \"hods of earth\" are the past beliefs Christine has held. Christine, in the beginning of the text, believed that women must truly be bad because she \"could scarcely find a moral work by any author which didn't devote some chapter or paragraph to attacking the female sex. [Therefore she] had to accept [these authors] unfavourable opinion[s] of women since it was unlikely that so many learned men, who seemed to be endowed with such great intelligence and insight into all things, could possibly have lied on so many different occasions.\"  Christine is not using reason to discover the merits of women. She believes all that she reads instead of putting her mind to listing all the great deeds women have accomplished. To help Christine see reason, Lady Reason comes and teaches Christine. She helps Christine dispel her own self-consciousness and the negative thoughts of past writers. By creating Lady Reason, Christine not only teaches her own allegorical self, but also her readers. She gives not only herself reason, but also gives readers, and women, reason to believe that women are not evil or useless creatures but instead have a significant place within society.\n\n\n==== Women discussed ====\nThe following 36 women are discussed in Part I of the Book of the City of Ladies.\n\n\n=== Part II ===\nIn Part II, Lady Rectitude says she will help Christine \"construct the houses and buildings inside the walls of the City of Ladies\" and fill it with inhabitants who are \"valiant ladies of great renown\". As they build, Lady Rectitude informs Christine with examples and \"stories of pagan, Hebrew, and Christian ladies\"  who possessed the gift of prophecy, chastity, or devotion to their families and others. Christine and Lady Rectitude also discuss the institution of marriage, addressing Christine's questions regarding men's claims about the ill qualities women bring to marriage. Lady Rectitude corrects these misconceptions with examples of women who loved their husbands and acted virtuously, noting that those women who are evil toward their husbands are \"like creatures who go totally against their nature\". Lady Rectitude also refutes allegations that women are unchaste, inconstant, unfaithful, and mean by nature through her stories. This part closes with Christine addressing women and asking them to pray for her as she continues her work with Lady Justice to complete the city.\n\n\n==== Women discussed ====\nThe following 92 women are discussed in Part II of the Book of the City of Ladies.\n\n\n=== Part III ===\nIn Part III, Lady Justice joins with Christine to \"add the finishing touches\" to the city, including bringing a queen to rule the city. Lady Justice tells Christine of female saints who were praised for their martyrdom. At the close of this part, Christine makes another address to all women announcing the completion of the City of Ladies. She beseeches them to defend and protect the city and to follow their queen (the Virgin Mary). She also warns the women against the lies of slanderers, saying, \"Drive back these treacherous liars who use nothing but tricks and honeyed words to steal from you that which you should keep safe above all else: your chastity and your glorious good name\".\n\n\n==== Women discussed ====\nThe following 37 women are discussed in Part III of the Book of the City of Ladies.\n\n\n== Boccaccio's influence ==\nChristine's main source for information was Giovanni Boccaccio's De mulieribus claris (On Famous Women), possibly in the French version, Des Cleres et Nobles Femmes. This text was a biographical treatise on ancient famous women. Christine also cited from Boccaccio's Decameron in the latter stages of The City of Ladies. The tales of Ghismonda and Lisabetta, for example, are quoted as coming from Boccaccio's Decameron.\nBoccaccio's influence can be seen in Christine's stance on female education. In the tale of Rhea Ilia, Boccaccio advocates for young women's right to choose a secular or religious life. He states that it is harmful to place young girls into convents while they are \u201cignorant, or young, or under coercion.\u201d  Boccaccio states that girls should be \u201cwell brought up from childhood in the parental home, taught honesty and praiseworthy behavior, and then, when they are grown and with their entire mind know what of their own free will\u201d choose the life of monasticism. Boccaccio believes that young girls need to be taught about life and virtues before they are consecrated to God.\nWhile he does not say women should have a formal education, he is still advocating for women to have a say in their lives and the right to be well informed about their possible futures. Therefore, Boccaccio's belief in educating young girls about secular and religious life could have acted as a stepping stone for Christine's belief in female education. Boccaccio's outlook was however, according to Margaret King and Albert Rabil, \"sexist in that he praised the traditional values of chastity, silence, and obedience in women, and furthermore depicting women in the public sphere as suffering as in form of punishment for transcending boundaries.\"\nBoccaccio's text is mainly used for Parts I and II of the book, while Part III is more reliant upon Jean de Vignay's Miroir historical (1333). This text is the French translation of the historical portions of Speculum Maius, an encyclopedia by Vincent of Beauvais that was begun after 1240.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe Book of the City of Ladies is an allegorical society in which the word \"lady\" is defined as a woman of noble spirit, instead of noble birth. The book, and therefore the city, contains women of past eras, ranging from pagans to ancient Jews to medieval Christian saints. The book includes discussion between Christine de Pizan and the three female Virtues which are sent to aid Christine build the city. These Virtues \u2013 Reason, Rectitude, and Justice \u2013 help Christine build the foundations and houses of the city, as well as pick the women who will reside in the city of ladies. Each woman chosen by the Virtues to live in the city acts as a positive example for other women to follow. These women are also examples of the positive influences women have had on society.\nChristine asks the virtues if women should be taught as men are and why some men think women should not be educated. Other questions that are explored are: the criminality of rape, the natural affinity in women to learn, and their talent for government.\n\n\n== See also ==\nThe Legend of Good Women (Chaucer)\nDe Mulieribus Claris (Boccaccio)\n\n\n== Sources ==\nOriginal sourcesDe Pizan, Christine.

    "John Henry Brooke": "Hon. John Henry Brooke MLA (15 May 1826 \u2013 8 January 1902), was a colonial Victorian politician.\n\n\n== Personal information ==\nBrooke was born at Boston, Lincolnshire on 15 May 1826 the son of John Brooke, a journalist and Mary Ann. He was apprenticed to a printer; became editor and manager of the Lincolnshire Times.  He arrived Melbourne in 1852\u20131853 where he became a reporter at the Melbourne Morning Herald subsequently a contractor for supplies to Legislative Council Club; superintendent of works Vic. Exhibition 1854; suggested and managed refreshment rooms at stations of Hobson's Bay Railway Company.\n\n\n== Career ==\nHe was elected to Legislative Assembly of Victoria for the electoral district of Geelong in November 1856 and held it until August 1859, then in the electoral district of Geelong West from October 1859 to August 1864. He was Commissioner of Crown Lands in Victoria under the Heales administration from November 1860 to November 1861, and remembered in connection with the land system of that colony. In 1857, as a member of the Assembly, he was prominent in opposition to the Haines Land Bill, which proposed giving annual licences to the squatters. On his own accession to office he, in conjunction with his colleagues Mr. J. M. Grant and Mr. Ireland, the Attorney-General, brought into operation the famous licences to occupy the waste lands of the Crown, which formed the basis of popular settlement for cultivation purposes on the public lands of Victoria. The scheme was formulated by a mere Gazette notice, the issue of which was formally censured by the Legislative Council. As the result of a dissolution of the Assembly Mr. Brooke's policy was approved by the country, and formed the subject of express eulogy in the Governor's opening speech to the new Parliament in August 1861. The occupation licences were approved by the new Assembly and again condemned by the Council, who denounced the introduction of the new departure by a mere departmental regulation as a breach of the principles of responsible government. The Governor regretted the disapprobation of the Council, but when they entreated that the legality of the licences might be tested in the Supreme Court, replied that his advisers were \"satisfied of their legality.\" He again nominated for the seat in 1864 though withdrew.He left for Japan in 1867 where he became editor and proprietor of the Japan Daily Herald, one of the first foreign newspapers in Japan.\n\n\n== Family ==\nHe married Harriet Williamson in 1849, and there were three sons and three daughters to the marriage.

Through his daughter Gertrude, his grandson was Alfred Brooke-Smith. His granddaughter Gertrude Georgina Cook, through his daughter Mabel, married diplomat Sir Herbert Phillips.\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Rope team": "The term rope team (German: Seilschaft), roped team or roped party, originally came from mountain sports, especially climbing, where it describes a group of people joined by a mountain or climbing rope and thus secured against falling. \n\n\n== Mountaineering and climbing ==\n\nIn mountain sports, especially climbing, a rope team is a group of mountaineers or climbers who are linked together by a safety rope. In a more general sense, a group of mountaineers, who are travelling together, may also be known as a rope team.\nThe common safety rope helps to protect individual members of the group from falling. That said, it may also heighten the risk for the group as a whole because, in unfavourable conditions, the fall of a single member may pull the entire party down as well.\nIn glacier crossings and on easier terrain, long stretches of the route may be negotiated purely by members of the climbing team being roped together without an anchor point being used. For this so-called \"walking on a rope\" everyone in the party attaches themselves to the safety rope at equal intervals. For parties of fewer than five people a certain amount of rope remains free at the front and back. The spare  rope may be used in the event of a crevasse accident, e.g. to make a Swiss pulley in order to rescue a fallen climber. For larger groups of about four people or more, recovering a fallen man is most easily done using a team pull. When \"walking on a rope\", the fall of one person - for example, into a crevasse - must be broken by the rest of the rope team members. So there is a danger that such a fall can endanger the entire team. On steep firn or ice-covered mountainsides, where possible and appropriate, the rope must be secured to an anchor point or the rope team members must negotiate it individually in order to prevent the risk of one climber falling and pulling the rest down with him.\nWhen climbing or in steep terrain where there is a high risk of falling, the rope is also secured to fixed points in the rock or ice. At the same time a \"sliding rope\" (gleitendes Seil) may be used or the rope may be fixed to a top anchor (Standplatz). A distinction is made between groups of two, three and four persons:\n\nTwo-man team: Consisting of a climber and a safety climber (or lead climber and following climber); mostly used in climbing halls, climbing gardens and Alpine climbing.\nThree-man team: Comprises a lead climber and two following climbers on a common single rope (branch using rope wedge) or two independent half rope sections; used in multi-rope length routes (e.g. in alpine climbing) and partly also on shorter routes in highlands areas (e.g. the Elbe Sandstone Mountains).\nFour-man team: Consisting of a lead climber and three followers; seldom used in alpine climbing.During glacier walks and simple high mountain tours, rope teams of more than four people are not uncommon.\nThere is a tendency for the rope team to move more slowly the more members it has. The reason for this is the increasing amount of time needed in a larger team for the coordination and to ensure the safety and protection of team members. Where the level of skill varies the rope team has to move at the pace of the slowest person.\n\n\n== See also ==\nClimbing\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Iana (goddess)": "Iana is the name of an ancient Roman goddess associated with arches and the moon, usually identified as either a form of Diana or the female counterpart of Janus.\nVarro (1st century BC) uses the name in his agricultural treatise, in a passage of dialogue in which the interlocutors explain that some farming tasks should be done when the moon is waxing, while the waning phase facilitates others, such as harvesting, shearing sheep, and clearing woodlands. It seems to be a name used by country people. Orosius (5th century AD) has a form Ianium (in some readings) equivalent to Dianium, referring to either a shrine or the Temple of Diana on the Aventine Hill. Diana is one of the Roman goddesses most often identified with the moon, but Usener thought Iana might be better identified with Juno Lucina.The Church Father Tertullian, however, calls Iana a diva arquis,  \"goddess of arches\" (Latin arcus or arquus, \"arch; rainbow\"). The arch as a passageway or portal suggests Iana as the female counterpart of Janus, whose role as a \"doorkeeper\" includes functions pertaining to time and the heavens. Varro's contemporary Nigidius Figulus identified Janus with Apollo and Iana with Diana.W.H. Roscher includes Iana among the indigitamenta, the list of deities maintained by Roman priests to assure that the correct divinity was invoked for rituals.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCardea\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Thomas Mtobi Mapikela": "Thomas Mtobi Mapikela (1869\u20131945) was one of the founding fathers of the South African Native National Congress which was formed 1912 and, in 1923, became the African National Congress. He was a carpenter by profession, but soon played a significant role in politics at the height of his career.  He is renowned for his contribution towards the attainment of democracy in South Africa.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nThomas Mtobi Mapikela was born on 12 November 1869 in a place called Hleuhoeng in Lesotho, which is approximately 10 kilometres south of Ficksburg. He was a descendant of the Hlubi by birth.  His family later moved to the Cape Colony where Mapikela received his primary education in Queenstown. He did his tertiary education at the Grahamstown Kaffir Institution (or the Natives\u2019 College) where he qualified as a cabinet maker.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn 1892, at the age of 23, Mapikela moved to Bloemfontein and settled in a township called Waaihoek where he worked as a carpenter and a builder. It was during this time that he became active in politics. The Waaihoek Township was situated close to where the Bloemfontein power station and cooling towers stand today. There also stands the founding home of the African National Congress \u2013 the Wesleyan School Church.\nIn Waaihoek, Mapikela owned two houses which were demolished during the forced removal of black people from the area. Black people from Waaihoek were then moved to Batho Location. He was not permitted to own two houses and then subsequently built himself a double-storey house. He was the only person in the whole of Batho Township who was permitted to own a double-storey house. Batho Township was laid out in 1918 and the building of the new houses commenced soon thereafter.In 1903, Mapikela set up his own independent building contracting enterprise. He was engaged in making furniture of many descriptions for schools around Bloemfontein. In a speech on 25 November 1940, Mapikela said: \n\n   I am the man who made all the furniture for Grey College and the University of the Orange Free State and the Europeans, some Europeans, asked why a native should be allowed to take the bread out of the mouth of their children. Not that I do not understand my trade... a member of Parliament said that he would not allow a native to do the work, which should be done by Europeans. We are dismissed. You are running the whole show... but please treat us better.\nMapikela was mainly involved in the erection of timber roof trusses, and the installation or manufacturing of specialised timber items.\n\n\n== Political career ==\nAfter the annexation of the Free State Republic by Britain in 1900, black political parties emerged. Mapikela was one of the members of the delegation which went to Britain to protest the Act of the Union of South Africa. In May 1903, he became a member of the Bloemfontein Native Vigilance Committee (BNCV) which superseded the Native Committee of the Bloemfontein district. \nIn 1904, he was instrumental in the forming of the Orange River Colony Vigilance Association and in 1906 became its office bearer.\nThe establishment and the formation of the Native Vigilance Association and the Orange River Colony Native Association (later named the Orange River Native Congress \u2013 ORNC), paved the way for Mapikela's political prominence. These political parties mainly fought for the enfranchisement of black people, including granting full political rights to blacks and safeguarding the political, social and religious welfare of African people. In June 1906, Mapikela was elected the secretary general of the ORNC. \nIn 1909, the anti-union delegation, led by William Schreiner, included Mapikela, John Tengo Jabavu, Abdullah Abdurrahman, Walter Rubusana, and Matt Fredericks. These men travelled to London to protest the British government with their racist provisions of the draft of the South African Act. Their voyage was however unsuccessful as clauses of the SA Act were included in the Union of South Africa.\nAs the president of the Free State Native Congress, Mapikela played a prominent role in the establishment of the South African Native National Congress (SANNC) in 1912, which was later in 1923, named the African National Congress. He was its official speaker for 28 years from its formation until 1940. Due to his multilingualism, this put him in a better position to continue as speaker of the organization.\nIn 1913, he was part of the delegation which travelled to Britain, protesting against the 1913 Land Act which afforded black people only 8% of the land in South Africa. In 1919, Mapikela was involved in the drafting of the SANNC's constitution which was a policy statement of the organisation for many years after. \nIn the 1930s, Mapikela served on the executive committees of both the ANC and the All African Convention \u2013 held in 1935 to oppose the second Hertzog (J. B. M. Hertzog) Bills and the removal of Africans in the Cape from the Common Voters roll. At the establishment of the Native Representative Council in 1937, Mapikela stood for Council and was subsequently elected as an executive member. In Council debates, he was famous for his staunch determination and stubborn character when he believed in a concept.\n\n\n== Mapikela House and its significance ==\nThe 12-roomed Mapikela House is situated on stand number 22093 in Batho Location in Bloemfontein. It is situated at the corner of Community and Makgothi Streets. This house became the meeting place for the ANC as well as the community.  On the rising of the step leading to the front door of the house, partially hidden by a second step, is the inscription \u2018Ulundi-Kaya\u2019 which literally means the \u2018horizon house\u2019. For a while, it was believed that Mapikela House was the founding venue of the ANC. However, research has concluded that this was not so. As the house in Batho was only built several years after the founding of the ANC, it is decidedly not the founding venue of the ANC. The house was built between 1923 and 1926.As the head blockman, Mapikela would hold meetings at his house to discuss community problems such as water supply, installation of electricity and the possible promotion of black education. As a carpenter, Mapikela did a lot of work for the Bloemfontein community at large. Due to the lack of mortuaries in Mangaung, Mapikela manufactured coffins in his house to assist mainly poor communities.Mapikela also housed prominent visitors from outside Bloemfontein in his house and therefore it became a lodging house. This house accommodated travellers from all over the country who visited Bloemfontein for personal, political and non-political reasons and who used trains as a mode of transport. Some of these travellers slept in this house due to the fact that during that time the hotels had restrictions in terms of accommodating black people. Travellers who did not want to sleep in dilapidated, unsafe waiting rooms at the stations, opted for the Mapikela House. Unfortunately, no restaurants in the city would serve black people and therefore Mapikela opened his house to black people for catering and dining services.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\nMapikela, as one of the founding members of the oldest liberation movement in Africa, continues to serve as a symbol of change, resilience and fighting against injustices towards black people in South Africa. His legacy is also recognised as a community developer.\nHis house is in the process of being declared a heritage site, and his grave at the Heroes Acre at Phahameng Cemetery has been declared in 2016\n\n\n== See also ==\nAfrican National Congress\nList of heritage sites in Free State\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.sahistory.org.za/dated-event/thomas-mtobi-mapikela-businessman-politician-and-speaker-african-national-congress-anc-w\nhttp://pzacad.pitzer.edu/NAM/newafrre/writers/mapikela/mapikelaS.htm\nhttp://pzacad.pitzer.edu/NAM/newafrre/writers/mapikela/mapikelaQ.htm",

    "Legend Airlines": "Legend Airlines was an airline headquartered at Dallas Love Field in Dallas, Texas, United States. Legend operated nonstop flights from its Love Field hub to Washington D.C., Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York City, the first carrier to fly from Love Field to destinations beyond the Wright Amendment five-state region after the opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in 1974. Legend's jet airliners were limited to 56 passenger seats by the Wright Amendment, so the aircraft were outfitted in a spacious all-business class layout, aiming at the lucrative business travel market.\nLegend's initial flights were substantially delayed by lobbying to persuade Congress to modify the Wright Amendment, court battles instigated by American Airlines and the city of Fort Worth, and by difficulties obtaining operational approval from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Flights began in April 2000, but were suspended indefinitely in December 2000 due to mounting losses, with the airline filing for bankruptcy. Efforts to secure additional financing and restart flights came to naught; the airline surrendered its air operating certificate and was liquidated in mid-2001.\nThe airline's private Love Field terminal\u2014which was independently owned and leased to the carrier\u2014was condemned under eminent domain and the gates razed after the 2006 Wright Amendment repeal imposed a 20-gate cap at the airport. These events triggered a series of lawsuits that were not fully settled until 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nBy the early 1960s, Love Field was reaching the limits of its capacity, and efforts to share Greater Southwest International Airport (GSW) in Fort Worth had proven unsuccessful. The situation was inefficient, and in 1964, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) ordered Dallas and Fort Worth to establish a new joint regional airport. The cities and airlines ultimately agreed, signing a 1968 bond ordinance obligating all existing carriers to move to the new regional airport and prohibiting the operation of competing municipal airports. The effort culminated in the demolition of GSW, the 1974 opening of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), the closure of Love Field to certified air carriers, and a corresponding effort to redevelop Love for general aviation.Southwest Airlines was founded after the 1968 bond ordinance; it was not a party to the agreement and felt that its business model would be affected by the long drive to the new airport. Dallas and Fort Worth sued Southwest but were unsuccessful in dislodging the airline from Love Field. After the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, Southwest announced plans to begin interstate service in 1979, angering powerful DFW backers. Acting on their behalf, Jim Wright, member of the U.S. House of Representatives serving Fort Worth, sponsored and helped pass an amendment to the International Air Transportation Act of 1979 in Congress that restricted passenger service out of Love Field in the following ways: \n\nService using larger mainline airliners could be provided from Love Field only to airports within Texas or to four neighboring U.S. states: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\nAirlines could not offer connecting flights, through service on another airline, or through ticketing beyond the five-state region.\nFlights to other states were allowed only on aircraft with 56 seats or fewer, in an attempt to prohibit mainline passenger service outside of the five-state region.By the mid-1990s, Southwest Airlines' business within the five-state region had burgeoned, but no carrier had seriously attempted to exploit the 56-seat exemption. Factions in Dallas had begun to view the Wright Amendment as anti-competitive and harmful to local business interests, but its restrictions were backed by Fort Worth and American Airlines to protect DFW Airport, and by local property owners who wanted to reduce jet noise and street traffic around Love Field. Attempts to modify the restrictions had become mired in lawsuits and controversy.\n\n\n=== Founding and early history ===\nLegend Airlines was the brainchild of T. Allan McArtor, former Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Administrator, Federal Express executive and a U.S. Air Force pilot who had been a member of the Air Force precision flying team, the Thunderbirds.  McArtor served as airline's President and CEO.In 1996, Dallas aviation company and Legend partner Dalfort Aviation announced that Legend would fly from Love Field using jets with 56 seats\u2014the maximum number allowed for long-haul flights under Wright. Dalfort would refurbish older McDonnell Douglas DC-9s or Boeing 727s\u2014aircraft that normally carried 90 or more passengers\u2014with an all-first class configuration and the excess space used for cargo. McArtor and Dalfort CEO Bruce Leadbetter claimed that buying new regional jets with 56 or fewer seats was too expensive and would not provide Dalfort with much-needed overhaul business. However, the United States Department of Transportation general counsel ruled in September 1996 that the 56-seat restriction applied to the \"designed capacity\" of an airliner rather than to the number of seats actually installed, prompting Legend to seek a change in the law; Texas Rep. Joe Barton was soon calling for the U.S. House to address of the 56-seat requirement.By July 1997, McArtor had enlisted the help of Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, who proposed to change the Wright restrictions to allow Legend to start service using the refurbished aircraft. On 7 October 1997, despite fierce opposition from the Texas congressional delegation, Shelby's efforts culminated in the passage of a United States Senate funding bill that included his amendment to allow nationwide flights using aircraft reconfigured with 56 seats and to add three new states to the Wright region. On 9 October 1997, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved the transportation funding bill containing the Shelby Amendment, with President Bill Clinton expected to promptly sign it into law.Within a month, Fort Worth was suing Legend and the city of Dallas, arguing for upholding the 1968 DFW bond agreement; Dallas and Legend argued that it could no longer be enforced. American Airlines joined Fort Worth in suing Dallas to stop the Shelby Amendment from taking effect, and McArtor accused American of having quietly orchestrated the entire campaign to block Legend. By February 1998, Southwest Airlines joined the Dallas lawsuit at the behest of Legend.McArtor argued that Fort Worth was also violating the bond agreement by allowing Mesa Airlines and FedEx Express to operate from Meacham Field and the recently-constructed Fort Worth Alliance Airport respectively. In October 1998, Legend sued Fort Worth, accusing the city of a \"double standard\" in its simultaneous support for Alliance and opposition to expansion at Love. However, State District Judge Bob McCoy dismissed the suit later that month on the grounds that Legend was not a party to the 1968 DFW bond agreement and thus lacked standing to sue.\n\n\n=== Service begins ===\nOn 5 April 2000, after further legal battles against Fort Worth and American Airlines and delays in gaining operating approval from the FAA, Legend began the first long-haul service from Love Field since 1974 with a flight to Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD). Legend Airlines soon operated nonstop service to IAD, Las Vegas McCarran International Airport (LAS) and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City was then added as a fourth destination.Despite continuing to argue in court that long-haul service from Love Field should be blocked, American Airlines, in a competitive move, reconfigured several of its Fokker 100 jets with 56 seats in a similar business class-like configuration and operated nonstop service from Love Field starting on 1 May 2000 to Chicago O'Hare Airport (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX) and LaGuardia (LGA).On 29 June 2000, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a federal appeals court decision allowing long-haul flights from Love, effectively ending the last attempt by Fort Worth, the D/FW Airport Board, and American Airlines to stop Legend in the courts.\n\n\n=== Demise ===\nLegend spent more than most new airlines prior to starting flights; figures range from $21 million to $29 million. Its aircraft had languished on the ground for 3 years. Although its flights to New York and Washington averaged almost two-thirds capacity, the airline lost $25 million during its first six months of operation, being afflicted by high start-up costs, high fuel costs, and intense competition from other airlines.Legend suspended flights indefinitely on 3 December 2000 after failing to secure additional financing, and announced that it would be filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In early 2001, Legend laid off all of its Dallas employees, surrendered its FAA operating certificate, and announced that it would enter Chapter 7 liquidation. In May, McArtor left Legend to head the North American unit of Airbus, and the airline's physical assets were auctioned in June 2001, including an estimated $1 million in DC-9 spares, but not the aircraft themselves, which were leased. By late 2002, two of the airline's former DC-9s were being operated by Southeast Airlines, one had been purchased by the Columbus Blue Jackets hockey team, and the other four had been mothballed in Kingman, Arizona awaiting new buyers.In 2016, journalist Robert Wilonsky described the airline's downfall as the result of a conspiracy by American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, the D/FW Airport Board, and the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth to \"break Legend before it ever got off the ground.\"Despite its failure to establish a viable aviation business, industry observers credited Legend Airlines with engineering the first substantive change to the controversial Wright Amendment and with introducing competition to Southwest Airlines at Love Field; when Legend ceased operation, American, Continental Express, and Delta Connection affiliate Atlantic Southeast Airlines had all begun operating from the airport to compete with the startup carrier. Legend's activities prompted other aviation interests to seriously consider using regional jets on long-haul flights from Love Field and to more openly back changes to the Wright Amendment, ideas that seemed infeasible beforehand. The Wright Amendment region was subsequently expanded again in 2005, and the law was partially repealed in 2006 and fully repealed in 2014.\n\n\n== In-flight services ==\nAiming for the lucrative full-fare business travel market, Legend Airlines provided a high level of service, with all seats in a business class configuration. Two wide seats were installed on each side of the generous center aisle (known as a 2-2 arrangement), and legroom was ample due to the removal of several entire rows of seats from its McDonnell Douglas DC-9 airliners, which usually carried 100 or more passengers in a 2-3 arrangement. Fresh flowers adorned aircraft interiors and the executive terminal at Love Field; the latter was set up so passengers could exit their aircraft and board a taxi in less than a minute. Legend was the first airline to offer live in-flight television on seat-back monitors; the DirecTV service was soon offered by JetBlue as well, but Legend offered it for free rather than charging travelers $5 to use it. Seats were also equipped with an AT&T Airfones and laptop computer charging ports. The lavish meals, described as \"celebrity-chef crafted\", were commissioned from several Dallas-area chefs and were served on real china with silverware, fresh fruit, and individual pats of real butter, rather than the plastic trays, plastic utensils, and packaged condiments and fruit generally offered by other carriers. Meals came with a ribbon-tied box of chocolate truffles and wines selected to complement the food. All of these amenities were offered for fares comparable to rival airlines' coach-class tickets.\n\n\n== Executive terminal ==\nLegend operated a separate executive passenger terminal at 7777 Lemmon Avenue and Lovers Lane and did not use the primary passenger terminal at Love Field. The Legend terminal cost $20 million to construct and reflected the airline's upscale image, with leather seats, fresh flowers, and gates designed to resemble private executive clubs.The complex was built by and leased from a private investment group loosely affiliated with Legend and Dalfort Aviation but not directly controlled by either company. Upon Legend's collapse, the owners immediately sought new tenants, subleasing one gate to Atlantic Southeast Airlines and entering into talks with American and Continental Express, who were then sharing the only two gates in the main terminal that were not controlled by Southwest Airlines. Despite the owner's efforts, the gates were vacant by the summer of 2002, although some office space had been leased to local businesses and parking garage space was being leased to nearby car dealerships to store inventory.In late 2005, the owners were publicly backing an effort to repeal the Wright Amendment, hoping to boost the lease value of the still-vacant gates; however, Dallas mayor Laura Miller was openly campaigning for the structure to be torn down. In October 2006, President George W. Bush signed a law partially repealing the Wright Amendment and imposing a 20-gate cap at Love Field, and the Dallas City Council approved using eminent domain to seize and raze the terminal. This effectively ended negotiations to sell the facility to Pinnacle Airlines, and the gates were subsequently condemned by the federal government and torn down, with the owners receiving nothing in return.The owners attempted to challenge the Wright Amendment repeal on antitrust grounds but the suit was thrown out by the federal courts in late 2007. However, the owners filed another suit in 2008 accusing the federal government of having condemned the structure without just compensation, and in April 2016, Federal Claims Judge Margaret M. Sweeney sided with owners Love Terminal Partners and Virginia Aerospace, ordering the government to pay them $133 million plus interest for having destroyed the property's economic value.\n\n\n== Fleet ==\n7 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 - seven (7) aircraft in fleet, all obtained secondhand from other airlines and configured with 56 seats\n\n\n== Destinations ==\nLegend Airlines served the following destinations during its existence:\nDallas, Texas: Love Field (DAL) - airline headquarters and hub\nLas Vegas, Nevada: McCarran International Airport (LAS)\nLos Angeles, California: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)\nNew York City, New York: LaGuardia Airport (LGA)\nWashington, D.C.: Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of defunct airlines of the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLegend Airlines on Planespotters.net\nLegend Airlines on the Wayback Machine",

    "Straub\u2013Huillet": "Jean-Marie Straub (French: [st\u0281ob]; born 8 January 1933) and Dani\u00e8le Huillet (pronounced [\u0265ij\u025b]; 1 May 1936 \u2013 9 October 2006) were a duo of French filmmakers who made two dozen films between 1963 and 2006. Their films are noted for their rigorous, intellectually stimulating style and radical, communist politics. Though both were French, they worked mostly in Germany and Italy. From the Clouds to the Resistance (1979) and Sicilia! (1999) are among the duo's best regarded works.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nStraub, who was born in Metz, met Paris-born Huillet as a student in 1954. Straub was involved in the Parisian cinephile community at the time. He was friends with Francois Truffaut and contributed to his publication Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, although Truffaut refused to publish Straub's more inflammatory writings. He worked as an assistant to the film director Jacques Rivette on the 1956 film A Fool's Mate. He also worked in Paris as an assistant to Abel Gance, Jean Renoir, Robert Bresson and Alexandre Astruc. The pair later emigrated to Germany so that Straub could avoid military service in Algeria. Straub spent his first few years researching Bach. Huillet had initially planned to make ethnographic films but eventually assisted Straub on his projects. In 1963, they made Machorka-Muff, an 18-minute short based on a Heinrich B\u00f6ll story and their first collaboration. Their next film, the 55-minute Not Reconciled, was also a B\u00f6ll adaptation.\nThey did not make a full-length feature until 1968's Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach, after which they made films at a fairly even rate, completing a feature every 2\u20133 years. The production of the Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach was very tedious. The struggle for funding lasted for ten years, until 1967. In 1968, they also made a short film starring Rainer Werner Fassbinder and his theatre troupe called The Bridegroom, the Actress and the Pimp. In the mid 1970s, they began producing films in Italy. Increasingly, they began splitting their time between Germany and Italy, as well as frequently collaborating with French and British producers.Straub and Huillet lived together for most of their lives. They had no children. Huillet died of cancer in Cholet on 9 October 2006, aged 70.\n\n\n== Style and content ==\nAll of the films of Straub and Huillet are based on other works: novels, operas, plays, and less conventional source materials, such as political writings. Their sources include writings by Marguerite Duras, Franz Kafka, Elio Vittorini and Bertolt Brecht; two operas by Arnold Schoenberg; letters written by Friedrich Engels, Wassily Kandinsky, and J.S. Bach; and other films, including Rossellini's Europa '51. Many of their films, such as Klassenverh\u00e4ltnisse, stress the relationship between the original text and the film.\nSince their first films Machorka-Muff (1962) and Not reconciled (1964) were made in Germany, Huillet and Straub were at the time included in the New German Film, which was loudly announced in the 1962 Oberhausen Manifesto. Frieda Grafe and Enno Patalas wrote about Machorka-Muff: \u201cOne should read B\u00f6ll's book because it has changed through Straub's film. It seems more naked and more serious because now with the last camera movement of the film it always points away from itself to Germany.\" If the choice of subjects - German post-war themes such as the continuity of fascist-nationalist thought patterns, broken biographies, rearmament - and a certain brittleness in the acting made the first two films typical productions of the time at first glance, the alienating, low-modulation language of the actors, alongside the non-chronological editing technique in Not Reconciled and the unconventional handling of the literary templates by Heinrich B\u00f6ll, also instilled among colleagues on incomprehension and rejection. At the Oberhausen Short Film Festival in 1963 and the Berlin International Film Festival in 1965, the first two films were rejected by the selection juries and only shown in special events. The third film, Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1967), was made possible by an unprecedented \"crowd funding\", which was supported by Alexander Kluge, Heinrich B\u00f6ll, Enno Patalas and the influential magazine Filmkritik. With this film, which had little in common with other German films of its time, Huillet and Straub entered new stylistic and dramaturgical territory. The sensual center of the film, lacking in conventional film plot, is the music of Johann Sebastian Bach, which is presented here live in front of the camera and partly in original locations - an uncompromising and elaborate appreciation of music in films that Huillet and Straub in the later films Moses and Aron (1974) and From Today to Tomorrow (1996), both based on operas by Arnold Schoenberg.\nThe style of all Straub and Huillet's films is that they always play with political commitment in different ways (\"toute r\u00e9volution est un coup de d\u00e9s\" - based on Mallarm\u00e9's poem about the nature of chance), even in an opera film based on biblical motifs, such as Moses and Aron, whom they dedicated to Holger Meins.\nAesthetically, they were particularly oriented towards the dramaturgical ideas of Bertolt Brecht, for example by saying that the actor should not play his role in an illusionistic way, but that he should identify his activity as what it is: quoting. You have therefore very often worked with amateur actors who put their natural dialects in place of perfectly standardized dialogues. Nevertheless, their films are characterized by an unbelievable aesthetic rigor and formal rigor: every shot is precisely constructed, no cut is a concession to conventions. But Straub sees himself as a traditionalist and has often expressed his affinity for classic filmmakers such as Kenji Mizoguchi and John Ford.\n\n\n=== Collaboration ===\nDue to his more extroverted nature, Jean-Marie Straub served as the public face of the couple: this has contributed to the widespread assumption that Huillet's role in their filmmaking process was secondary. In reality, the two split their work equally, with Straub responsible for mise en sc\u00e8ne, Huillet controlling much of the production design and editing process, and the two being equally responsible for the pre-production, texts and rehearsals. This method can be seen in Pedro Costa's documentary Where Does Your Hidden Smile Lie?, filmed during the editing of Sicilia!.What is special about the work of Huillet and Straub is the often decades-long continuity that they have with many of their employees. They realized most of their work with two cameramen: William Lubtchansky (9 films) and Renato Berta (20 films to date), with whom Jean-Marie Straub still works today. The sound engineer Louis Hochet was responsible for the sound recordings for 15 of her films between 1967 and 1998, including the films Chronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1967), [4] Moses and Aron (1974) and Von heute, which are determined by live recorded music auf Morgen (1996), each of which broke new ground in integrating music into a film. An equally formative connection existed with the Tuscan town of Buti, which was used primarily as a location for the films based on Cesare Pavese's dialogues with Leuko, as well as with the Teatro Francesco di Bartolo located there, whose ensemble has participated in a total of ten films.\nHuillet and Straub often paid tribute to friends and colleagues, such as the filmmakers Peter Nestler, Frans van de Staak, Holger Meins and Jean-Luc Godard or their long-time cameraman Renato Berta. For their part, Straub and Huillet were more often the subject of films by others. Those who have made films about his and her work include Harun Farocki (Jean-Marie Straub and Dani\u00e8le Huillet working on a film based on Franz Kafka's novel Amerika, 1983), Pedro Costa (Where Does Your Hidden Smile Lie?, 2001) and Peter Nestler (Defense of Time, 2007).\n\n\n=== Reception ===\nTheir film has received positive responses from leading film critics: in Germany, for example, those of Enno Patalas, Frieda Grafe, Alexander Kluge, Helmut F\u00e4rber and Ulrich Gregor, later by Harun Farocki and Hartmut Bitmosky and others. In France, the Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, whose authors Michel Delahaye and Serge Daney, later the film critics Bernard Eisenschitz, Fran\u00e7ois Albera and Beno\u00eet Turquety; in Italy the Filmcritica and especially its author Adriano Apr\u00e1, who also directed the Pesaro film festival for a long time and played the title role in Straub and Huillet's film Othon (1969). The couple's films also found a fan base in the US early on, thanks in large part to the support of arthouse cinema operator Dan Talbot, film critics Jonathan Rosenbaum and J. Hoberman and curator Richard Roud, who was the long program director of the London and New York film festivals.  Filmmakers Pedro Costa, Deborah Stratman, Thom Andersen, and Ted Fendt have cited them as an influence.\nDespite some positive criticism, their films were and are often met with incomprehension. Especially in the first decades of Straub-Huillet's filmmaking, the accusation of amateurism was often raised against them from this side. A criticism based on the concept of continuity and the narrative conventions of classical cinema as a set of values finds numerous breaks in the Straub-Huillet cinema. Another point of criticism is the alleged lack of emotion in their films. Lecture as well as gestures and facial expressions of the actors are expressionless, anti-dramatic and deliberately boring.\nThe last joint-film by Straub and Huillet, Quei loro incontri, was part of the competition at the 63rd Venice Film Festival in 2006. At the festival, Straub and Huillet were awarded a special prize \"for the invention of cinematic language in their entirety.\" They received late recognition of the film industry by Jury President Catherine Deneuve. But at the award ceremony there was a scandal: Straub and Huillet were not present, instead the actress Giovanna Daddi read a statement written by Straub. It said that as long as there was American imperialist capitalism, there could never be enough terrorists in the world. The statement caused protests at the festival and in the Italian press. The jury discussed withdrawing the award. Defenders of the Straub-Huillet's cinema point out that Straub's private, polemical statements should not influence the appreciation of the cinematic work.After Dani\u00e8le Huillet's death in 2006, their work became less controversial. Their work received new international recognition in New York, Paris, Madrid, Berlin, London, Lisbon and Tokyo. The retrospectives were preceded by the successful efforts of BELVA-Film (Jean-Marie Straub, Barbara Ulrich) to restore and digitize their entire work.\nFrom January 2019 through September 2020, the streaming service MUBI held the first digital Straub-Huillet retrospective, showcasing new restorations of fifteen of their films, including Straub's final feature film Kommunisten.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nMachorka-Muff (1963)\nNicht vers\u00f6hnt oder Es hilft nur Gewalt wo Gewalt herrscht (1965)\nChronik der Anna Magdalena Bach (1968)\nDer Br\u00e4utigam, die Kom\u00f6diantin und der Zuh\u00e4lter (1968)\nLes Yeux ne veulent pas en tout temps se fermer, ou Peut-\u00eatre qu'un jour Rome se permettra de choisir \u00e0 son tour (1970)\nGeschichtsunterricht (1972)\nEinleitung zu Arnold Schoenbergs Begleitmusik zu einer Lichtspielscene (1973)\nMoses und Aron (1975)\nFortini/Cani (1976)\nToute r\u00e9volution est un coup de d\u00e9s (1977)\nDalla nube alla resistenza (1979)\nEn rach\u00e2chant (1982)\nTrop tot/trop tard (1982)\nKlassenverh\u00e4ltnisse (also released as Class Relations) (1984)\nDer Tod des Empedokles (1987)\nSchwarze S\u00fcnde (1989)\nPaul C\u00e9zanne im Gespr\u00e4ch mit Joachim Gasquet (1989)\nDie Antigone des Sophokles nach der H\u00f6lderlinschen \u00dcbertragung f\u00fcr die B\u00fchne bearbeitet von Brecht 1948 (Suhrkamp Verlag) (1992)\nLothringen!

    "East Poland, Maine": "Poland is a town in Androscoggin County, Maine, United States. The population was 5,906 at the 2020 census. Set among rolling hills and numerous lakes, the town is home to Range Ponds State Park, which includes hiking trails and a pristine freshwater beach. Poland is also a historic resort area. It is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan statistical area, which itself is part of the Greater Portland-Lewiston Combined Statistical Area.\n\n\n== History ==\nLand was granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1765 to officers and soldiers who served with Sir William Phips in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1736 grant made to them called Bakerstown (now Salisbury, New Hampshire) which was ruled invalid in 1741 at the separation of New Hampshire from Massachusetts. The new plantation was also called Bakerstown (after Captain Thomas Baker), and included present-day Poland, Minot, Mechanic Falls and the greater part of Auburn.Settled in 1767 by Nathaniel Bailey and Daniel Lane, Bakerstown Plantation would be incorporated as Poland on February 17, 1795. Poland is - very unusually - named after a 16th-century song, Poland.At the beginning, Poland was an agricultural town, with 600 acres (2.4 km2) of the best land farmed by the Shakers who settled at Poland Hill, north of the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village in New Gloucester. Called the North Family of Shakers, the village was founded by members who moved from Gorham in 1819. The village lasted until 1887.Industry was attracted to Poland's water power sites. In 1859, when the population was 2,660, it had four sawmills, a gristmill, a tannery and a carriage factory. The St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad passed through the northeastern corner of the town, spurring development and bringing tourists drawn to its scenic ponds and gentle hills. By 1893, when Mechanic Falls was set off as a separate town, Poland had evolved into a Gilded Age resort town.In 1797, The Wentworth Ricker Inn in South Poland opened at the homestead Jabez Ricker, acquired from a 1794 land swap with the Alfred Shaker Village in Alfred. But when the railroad replaced stage travel, patronage declined and the inn closed. Then a grandson, Hiram Ricker, began proclaiming that the mineral spring on his family's property had cured his dyspepsia. People began arriving to sample the spring's curative waters, which flow 8 gallons a minute. Reopened in 1861, the inn was enlarged and renamed The Mansion House. But even that property could not handle the crowds of tourists, so in 1875 the family expanded the property, build an extravagant house that was dubbed \"Ricker's folly\" due to skepticism that such a large property would be successful.On July 4, 1876, the Poland Spring House opened atop Ricker's Hill, an elevation of 800 feet (244 m) above sea level with magnificent views to the White Mountains. The hotel would be augmented over the years by architects John Calvin Stevens, Albert Winslow Cobb and Harry Wilkerson. It became a self-contained and exclusive spa, with guards at gatehouses instructed to turn away sightseers. With luxurious accommodations for 450 guests, the hotel attracted the rich and famous. Patrons included Gen. Benjamin Butler, Sen. James G. Blaine, Joan Crawford, Jimmy Durante, Jack Paar and Robert Goulet. But following World War II, the era of grand hotels waned. When the Rickers sold the Poland Spring House, its new owners allowed the sprawling facilities to deteriorate. Apollo Industries purchased the hotel in 1963 and converted it to the largest Women's Job Corps facility in the United States. The Job Corps dormitory was vacated in 1969, and was destroyed by a spectacular fire on July 3, 1975.Today, the famous water is bottled and sold as Poland Spring water by Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, a subsidiary of Nestl\u00e9.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 1978 P-3 Orion crash ===\n\nPoland was the site of one of the last major accidents involving aircraft from Maine's Cold War air bases. A United States Navy patrol bomber from Naval Air Station Brunswick Patrol Squadron 8 (VP-8) disintegrated over Poland on September 22, 1978. An over-pressurized fuel tank caused the port wing of the Lockheed P-3 Orion to separate at the outboard engine. The detached wing sheared off part of the tail; and aerodynamic forces caused the remaining engines and starboard wing to detach from the fuselage. Debris rained down over a wide area near the Tripp Corner intersection on Route 11 shortly after noon. No homes were hit, but an explosive fuel-air fire following impact broke some windows. There were no survivors from the plane's eight-man crew.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 47.19 square miles (122.22 km2), of which 42.23 square miles (109.38 km2) is land and 4.96 square miles (12.85 km2) is water. Poland is drained by the Little Androscoggin River.\nThe town is crossed by state routes 11, 26 and 122. It is bordered by the towns of Mechanic Falls to the north, Minot to the northeast, Auburn to the east, New Gloucester to the southeast, Casco and Raymond to the southwest, and Otisfield and Oxford to the northwest.\n\n\n=== Tripp Pond ===\nTripp Pond is on the west side of Maine State Route 11, which provides shoulder parking for public access to the east shore of the pond. There is a ramp for trailered boats at the south end of the pond. Summer water temperatures are too high for trout, but the pond provides good habitat for white perch and largemouth bass. The north end of the pond overflows through a series of shallow ponds to the Little Androscoggin River near Welchville in the town of Oxford, Maine 5 miles (8.0 km) to the north.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nThis climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters.  According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Poland has a humid continental climate, Dfb on climate maps.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 5,376 people, 2,140 households, and 1,581 families living in the town. The population density was 127.3 inhabitants per square mile (49.2/km2). There were 2,679 housing units at an average density of 63.4 per square mile (24.5/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.4% White, 0.4% African American, 0.3% Native American, 0.4% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.3% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.6% of the population.\nThere were 2,140 households, of which 31.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.6% were married couples living together, 8.9% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.4% had a male householder with no wife present, and 26.1% were non-families. 18.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 2.81.\nThe median age in the town was 43.4 years. 22.2% of residents were under the age of 18; 5.8% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 24.7% were from 25 to 44; 35% were from 45 to 64; and 12.2% were 65 years of age or older.

    "Tygart": "The Tygart Valley River \u2014 also known as the Tygart River \u2014 is a principal tributary of the Monongahela River, approximately 135 miles (217 km) long, in east-central West Virginia in the United States.  Via the Monongahela and Ohio rivers, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 1,329 square miles (3,440 km2) in the Allegheny Mountains and the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau.\n\n\n== Course ==\nThe Tygart Valley River rises in the Allegheny Mountains in Pocahontas County and flows generally north-northwestwardly through Randolph, Barbour, Taylor and Marion counties, past the towns of Huttonsville, Mill Creek, Beverly, Elkins, Junior, Belington, Philippi, Arden, and Grafton, to Fairmont, where it joins the West Fork River to form the Monongahela River. (The Tygart is thus the \"East Fork\" of the Monongahela.) Downstream of Elkins, the Tygart passes through a gap between Rich Mountain and Laurel Mountain, which are considered to be part of the westernmost ridge of the Allegheny Mountains and the boundary between the Alleghenies and the Allegheny Plateau.Along its course the river collects Leading Creek at Elkins; the Middle Fork River and the Buckhannon River (its largest tributary) in Barbour County; and Sandy Creek and Three Fork Creek in Taylor County.  Just upstream of Grafton, the river was impounded by a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam in 1938 to form Tygart Lake.  Valley Falls State Park is along the river between Grafton and Fairmont.\n\n\n== Discharge ==\nAt its mouth, the river has an estimated mean annual flow volume of 2,855 cubic feet per second (80.8 m3/s). At the United States Geological Survey's stream gauge in Philippi, the annual mean flow of the river between 1940 and 2005 was 1,922 ft\u00b3/s (54 m\u00b3/s).  The river's highest flow during the period was estimated at 61,000 ft\u00b3/s (1,727 m\u00b3/s) on November 5, 1985.  The lowest recorded flow was 4.9 ft\u00b3/s (0.1 m\u00b3/s) on several days in October 1953.At an upstream gauge near the community of Dailey in Randolph County, the annual mean flow of the river between 1915 and 2005 was 358 ft\u00b3/s (10 m\u00b3/s). The highest recorded flow during the period was 19,900 ft\u00b3/s (564 m\u00b3/s) on May 17, 1996. Readings of zero were recorded for several months during autumn of the years 1930 and 1953.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Tygart Valley was first settled by Europeans in 1753 when David Tygart (for whom the valley and river are named) and Robert Files (or Foyle) located (separately) with their families in the vicinity of present-day Beverly. Although there had been no recent history of conflicts between whites and Indians in that immediate area, that summer a party of Indians traveling the Shawnee Trail discovered the Files cabin and killed seven members of the family. One son escaped and alerted the Tygart family, allowing all to escape. No other white settlement was attempted in present Randolph County until 1772. (It has been thought that Tygart was again among those settling then, but this is not certain).The brothers John and Samuel Pringle, who had taken up residence along the Buckhannon tributary of the Tygart (in present Upshur County) in 1761, acted as their contemporary Daniel Boone was doing in Kentucky and guided numerous immigrant settlers into the main valley of the Tygart which at that time abounded in game and fertile bottomlands. Settlers of the 1770s and '80s included the Connelly, Hadden, Jackson, Nelson, Riffle, Stalnaker, Warwick, Westfall, Whiteman and Wilson families. (One settler, John Jackson [1715\u20131801] from County Londonderry, Ireland, was great-grandfather to Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson.)\nSeveral minor actions occurred in the Valley during the American Civil War, including the Battle of Philippi, the Battle of Laurel Hill and the Battle of Cheat Mountain, all in 1861.\n\n\n== Variant names and spellings ==\nThe United States Board on Geographic Names settled on \"Tygart River\" as the stream's name in 1902, and changed it to \"Tygart Valley River\" in 1950.

    "Floating battery": "A floating battery is a kind of armed watercraft, often improvised or experimental, which carries heavy armament but has few other qualities as a warship.\n\n\n== History ==\nUse of timber rafts loaded with cannon by Danish defenders of Copanhagen against bomb ketches of a combined British-Dutch-Swedish fleet is attested by Nathaniel Uring in 1700.  An early appearance was in 1782 at the Great Siege of Gibraltar, and its invention and usage is attributed to Spanish Lieutenant General Antonio Barcel\u00f3.\nA purpose-built floating battery was Fl\u00e5debatteri No. 1, designed by Chief Engineer Henrik Gerner in 1787; it was 47 m (154 ft) long, 13 m (43 ft) wide and armed with 24 guns, and was used during the 1801 Battle of Copenhagen under the command of Peter Willemoes. The British made limited use of floating batteries during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the two-vessel  Musquito and  Firm-class floating batteries, and some individual vessels such as HMS Redoubt.\nThe most notable floating batteries were built or designed in the 19th century, and are related to the development of the first steam warship and the ironclad warship.\nDemologos, the first steam-propelled warship, was a floating battery designed for the protection of New York Harbor in the War of 1812.\nIn the 1850s, the British and French navies deployed iron-armoured floating batteries as a supplement to the wooden steam battlefleet in the Crimean War. The role of the battery was to assist unarmoured mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications.  The French used their batteries in 1855 against the defenses at Kinburn on the Black Sea, where they were effective against Russian shore defences.  The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against Kronstadt, and may have been influential in causing the Russians to sue for peace. However, Kronstadt was widely regarded as the most heavily fortified naval arsenal in the world throughout most of the 19th-century, continually upgrading its combined defences to meet new changes in technology.  Even as the British armoured-batteries were readied against Kronstadt in early 1856, the Russians had already constructed newer networks of outlying forts, mortar batteries of their own, and submarine mines against which the British had no system for removing under fire.\nTraditional floating battery called kotta mara was used by the Banjar and Dayak against the Dutch during the Banjar war (1859-1906). The battery is made by adding walls (sloped and unsloped) to a raft made by large logs. Some of them shaped like a castle and had bastions with 4 cannons on each bastion. The kotta mara could resist the Dutch 30-pounder cannons until 24.5 m range, the range which the cannon could effectively penetrate it.Floating batteries were popularly implemented by both the Union and the Confederacy during the American Civil War.  The first was the Confederate Floating Battery of Charleston Harbor, which took an active part in the bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861. Experimental ironclad vessels that proved too cumbersome or were underpowered were often converted into floating batteries and posted for river and coastal waterway control.  Here too, Civil War batteries and even ironclads such as the famed monitors, were acutely vulnerable to mines protected in turn by forts.  As a result, the combined defences of Charleston, South Carolina, for example, were never overwhelmed by the Union Navy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nUnited States floating battery Demologos\nArsenal ship\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSieche, Erwin (1984). \"Question 50/81\".

    "Gulshan": "Gulshan Kumar Dua (5 May 1956 \u2013 12 August 1997), was an Indian businessman and film and music producer who was the founder of the Super Cassettes Industries Limited (T-Series) music label in the Bollywood industry. He founded T-Series in the 1980s and established it as a leading record label in the 1990s.\nIn 1997, he was murdered by the Mumbai underworld syndicate D-Company. After his death, T-Series has since been run by his younger brother Krishan Kumar and son Bhushan Kumar. His daughters Tulsi Kumar and Khushali Kumar are also playback singers.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nGulshan Kumar Dua was the son of Chandrabhan Kumar Dua, a fruit juice vendor who worked the streets of the Daryaganj neighbourhood in the heart of Delhi. Dua started working with his father from an early age. He was a devoted worshiper of Shri Shiv Ji and Devi Parvati, as he was a follower of the Shaiva tradition of Hinduism.\nDua changed career paths when his family acquired a shop selling records and inexpensive audio cassettes, which foreshadowed the onset of a vast music empire.\n\n\n== Music business and film career ==\nGulshan Kumar started his own audio cassette operation known as \"Super Cassettes Industries,\" which turned in to a profitable business. He began a music production company in Noida. As his business started growing, he moved to Mumbai.His first movie in Bollywood was Lal Dupatta Malmal Ka in 1989. Next was the big hit Aashiqui in 1990 which is remembered for its music by Nadeem\u2013Shravan. His other movies included Bahaar Aane Tak, Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin, Ayee Milan Ki Raat, Meera Ka Mohan, Jeena Marna Tere Sang and Bewafa Sanam.\n\n\n=== T-Series music label ===\n\nDuring the life of Gulshan Kumar, T-Series emerged as one of the top music labels in India. It continues to be a major label.Today T-Series controls more than 60% share of the Indian music market. In international market, T-Series enjoys a turnover in excess of $4.2 million, and exports to 24 countries across six continents. In India, it has the largest distribution network of over 2500 dealers.\n\n\n=== Film Acted ===\n\n\n== Assassination and death ==\nGulshan Kumar Dua died in a shooting outside the Jeeteshwar Mahadev Mandir, a Hindu mandir dedicated to Lord Shiva of which he attended daily in Jeet Nagar, Andheri West suburb of Mumbai, on 12 August 1997. He was shot 16 times. \nOn the day of the assassination, his bodyguard, provided by the Uttar Pradesh government, was sick. Although he had received two threatening calls, on 5 and 8 August 1997, Kumar refused to pay the extortion money. The hired killers, including Rauf and Abdul Rashid, conducted reconnaissance for a month, but did not proceed because of the armed bodyguard. At 10.40 am, while returning from the temple, he was confronted by one of the assassins who said:  \"Bahut puja kar li, ab upar ja ke karna (you have done enough puja, now do it up there).\"  Initially, Kumar survived and sought shelter in nearby huts, but residents shut their doors. His driver Suraj was shot in both legs as he tried to shelter Kumar.A Mumbai underworld organisation called D-Company is considered to have been responsible for this assassination. The police also accused film composer Nadeem Saifi of the music duo Nadeem-Shravan of having paid for the murder due to a personal dispute and fled the country after the murder. However, on 9 January 2001, Abdul Rauf Merchant (known as \"Raja\") confessed to being the murderer. On 29 April 2002, Sessions Judge M. L. Tahilyani sentenced Rauf to life imprisonment, stating that he was not imposing the death penalty because the prosecution had failed to prove that Rauf was a contract killer. The police alleged that Saifi paid Abu Salem, a known associate of Dawood Ibrahim, to assassinate Dua and assigned Rauf to the job, but it just so happened that Ibrahim and Abu Salem were already planning on murdering Dua as he had refused to pay protection money to D-Company as part of an extortion attempt. As per his family's wishes, Gulshan Kumar Dua was cremated in a shamshan (cremation ground) in Delhi.After the police's allegations against him, Nadeem Saifi had fled to the United Kingdom. In 2001, the case was taken to the London High Court, which rejected the Indian government's request for extradition on the ground that there was no prima facie case against Saifi. In August 2001, the prosecution's main witness, Mohammed Ali Hussain Shaikh, who had earlier claimed Saifi participated in the murder, eventually claimed that he didn't know Saifi and had never seen him. Abu Salem also denied Nadeem's involvement on Indian national television. Saifi was also exonerated by four courts, including the House of Lords in the United Kingdom and the sessions court in Mumbai. Saifi eventually acquired British citizenship, and later moved to Dubai, where he runs a successful perfumery business.Abdul Rauf alias Daud Merchant was convicted in 2002 for the murder of Gulshan Kumar. He fled India after he was granted furlough by the Bombay high court in 2009. He was extradited from Bangladesh in 2016. He is currently in the high-security Arthur Road jail in Mumbai.In late 1980s and early '90s, Bollywood was impacted by the Mumbai mafia dominance and extortions. The influence of organised crime in the film industry was such there were regular reports of film stars attending events hosted by mafia bosses and allegedly enjoying their patronage. It is believed that Gulshan Kumar had refused to pay extortion to gangster Dawood Ibrahim.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2017, T-Series announced plans to produce a biographical film about Kumar titled Mogul \u2013 The Gulshan Kumar Story.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMusic of Bollywood\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGulshan Kumar at IMDb\nThe Gulshan Kumar Murder Homepage at Rediff.com",

He also had two even more aggressive and politically charged, but less prolific and recognized by-projects, the bands Die vom Himmel fielen and Utell A Lie, his only ever English-speaking project. During this time he established an independent record label called \"B.A. Records\" to put out his music and also to produce other bands like Tomte.\nIn 1994, while still playing with ...But Alive, he released his first and only solo album \"Hippiekacke\", which did not really satisfy him.After breaking up all three groups he played in the ska-band Rantanplan and still plays in the rock-band Kettcar. To publish Kettcar's records he merged \"B.A.\" with Tomte-singer Thees Uhlmann's \"Hotel van Cleef\" to form record label Grand Hotel van Cleef which he is co-owner and managing director of to this day. The label has evolved into one of the most influential, most popular independent labels in Germany with many more bands having signed on since.\nIn 2004 Wiebusch and Uhlmann were approached to take part in a movie project, \"Keine Lieder \u00fcber Liebe\", which entailed the formation of a band with actor J\u00fcrgen Vogel as singer. Wiebusch and Uhlmann agreed and wrote ten songs (based on the fictional biography of Vogel's character) for this band, Hansen, played guitar and sang background during the album's recordings and a tour during which filming took place and acted in the movie.

    "The Typhoon": "A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180\u00b0 and 100\u00b0E in the Northern Hemisphere.  This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin, and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth, accounting for almost one-third of the world's annual tropical cyclones. For organizational purposes, the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions: the eastern (North America to 140\u00b0W), central (140\u00b0W to 180\u00b0), and western (180\u00b0 to 100\u00b0E). The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) for tropical cyclone forecasts is in Japan, with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii (the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), the Philippines and Hong Kong. While the RSMC names each system, the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year.Within most of the northwestern Pacific, there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year. Like any tropical cyclone, there are few main requirements for typhoon formation and development: (1) sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, (2) atmospheric instability, (3) high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, (4) enough Coriolis effect to develop a low pressure center, (5) a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and (6) a low vertical wind shear. While the majority of storms form between June and November, a few storms may occur between December and May (although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time). On average, the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally. Like other basins, they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest, with some systems recurving near and east of Japan. The Philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls, with China and Japan being less often impacted. However, some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck China. Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region, with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives. Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins. However, Vietnam recognises its typhoon season from the beginning of June through to the end of November, with an average of four to six typhoons hitting the country annually.\n\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\n\n=== Etymology and usage ===\nThe term typhoon is the regional name in the northwest Pacific for a severe (or mature) tropical cyclone, whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic. Elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone, severe tropical cyclone, or severe cyclonic storm.The French typhon is attested with the meaning of whirlwind or storm since 1504. The Oxford English Dictionary cites Hindustani \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n and Chinese tai fung giving rise to several early forms in English. The earliest forms in English\u2014\"touffon\", later \"tufan\", \"tuffon\", and others\u2014derive from Hindustani \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n, with citations as early as 1588.  From 1699 appears \"tuffoon\", later \"tiffoon\", derived from Chinese with spelling influenced by the older Hindustani-derived forms.  The modern spelling \"typhoon\" dates to 1820, preceded by \"tay-fun\" in 1771 and \"ty-foong\", all derived from the Chinese tai fung.\nThe Hindustani source word \u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n (\"violent storm\"; Perso-Arabic: \u0637\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646, Devanagari: \u0924\u0942\u092b\u093c\u093e\u0928) comes from the Persian t\u016bf\u0101n (\u062a\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646/\u0637\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646) meaning \"storm\" which comes from the verb t\u016bf\u012bdan (\u062a\u0648\u0641\u06cc\u062f\u0646/\u0637\u0648\u0641\u06cc\u062f\u0646), \"to roar, to blow furiously\". The word \u0637\u0648\u0641\u0627\u0646 (\u1e6d\u016bf\u0101n) is also derived from Arabic as coming from \u1e6d\u0101fa, to turn round.The Chinese source is the word tai fung or taifeng (simplified Chinese: \u53f0\u98ce; traditional Chinese: \u98b1\u98a8; pinyin: t\u00e1if\u0113ng).  The modern Japanese word, \u53f0\u98a8 (\u305f\u3044\u3075\u3046, taifuu); as well as the modern Korean word \ud0dc\ud48d (taepung) are also derived from Chinese.  The first character is normally used to mean \"pedestal\" or \"stand\", but is actually a simplification of the older Chinese character \u98b1, which means \"typhoon\"; thus the word originally meant \"typhoon wind\". In Vietnamese, \"\u5927 \u98a8\" (\u0111\u1ea1i phong) translates literally to \"strong winds\", but the phrase \"b\u00e3o nhi\u1ec7t \u0111\u1edbi\" (\u66b4\u71b1\u5e36 'Ferocious tropical storm') is used instead. \nThe Ancient Greek \u03a4\u03c5\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd (Typh\u00f4n, \"Typhon\") is related and has secondarily contaminated the word. The Persian term may originally have been influenced by the Greek word.\n\n\n=== Intensity classifications ===\n\nA tropical depression is the lowest category that the Japan Meteorological Agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots (38 mph; 61 km/h). A tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained wind speeds exceed 34 knots (39 mph; 63 km/h). Tropical storms also receive official names from RSMC Tokyo. Should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots (55 mph; 89 km/h) then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm. Once the system's maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots (74 mph; 119 km/h), the JMA will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoon\u2014the highest category on its scale.Since 2009 the Hong Kong Observatory has divided typhoons into three different classifications: typhoon, severe typhoon and super typhoon. A typhoon has wind speed of 64\u201379 knots (73\u201391 mph; 118\u2013149 km/h), a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots (92 mph; 150 km/h), and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots (120 mph; 190 km/h). The United States' Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130 knots (67 m/s; 150 mph; 241 km/h)\u2014the equivalent of a strong Category 4 storm in the Saffir-Simpson scale\u2014as super typhoons. However, the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the JTWC uses are based on a 1-minute averaging period, akin to the U.S.' National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center. As a result, the JTWC's wind reports are higher than JMA's measurements, as the latter is based on a 10-minute averaging interval.\n\n\n== Genesis ==\n\nThere are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis: sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures, atmospheric instability, high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere, enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center, a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance, and low vertical wind shear. While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation, they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form. Normally, an ocean temperature of 26.5 \u00b0C (79.7 \u00b0F) spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres (160 ft) is considered the minimum to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone. These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. A minimum distance of 500 km (300 mi) from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis.\nWhether it be a depression in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) or monsoon trough, a broad surface front, or an outflow boundary, a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis. About 85 to 90 percent of Pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough. Even with perfect upper-level conditions and the required atmospheric instability, the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low. Vertical wind shear of less than 10 m/s (20 kn, 33 ft/s) between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development. Typically with Pacific typhoons, there are two outflow jets: one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the Westerlies, and a second towards the equator.In general, westerly wind increases associated with the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins. As the oscillation propagates from west to east, it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere's summer season. On average, twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific Ocean, near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south, along the same meridian, or line of longitude. There is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin, however. When one basin is active, the other is normally quiet, and vice versa. The main reason for this appears to be the phase of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, or MJO, which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time.\n\n\n== Frequency ==\nNearly one-third of the world's tropical cyclones form within the western Pacific. This makes this basin the most active on Earth. Pacific typhoons have formed year round, with peak months from August to October. The peak months correspond to that of the Atlantic hurricane seasons. Along with a high storm frequency, this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record. One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013. Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific Ocean, and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian Ocean. The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist. \nAcross the Philippines themselves, activity reaches a minimum in February, before increasing steadily through June, and spiking from July through October, with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago. Activity falls off significantly in November, although Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest Philippine typhoon on record, was a November typhoon. The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern Visayas. A ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receive less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequency.\n\n\n== Paths ==\n\nMost tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies. Most typhoons form in a region in the northwest Pacific known as typhoon alley, where the planet's most powerful tropical cyclones most frequently develop. When the subtropical ridge shifts due to El Ni\u00f1o, so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks. Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September\u2013November tropical cyclone impacts during El Ni\u00f1o and neutral years. During El Ni\u00f1o years, the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130\u00b0E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Ni\u00f1a years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the subtropical ridge position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea. Typhoon paths follow three general directions.\nStraight track (or straight runner). A general westward path affects the Philippines, southern China, Taiwan, and Vietnam.\nA parabolic recurving track. Storms recurving affect eastern Philippines, eastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East.\nNorthward track. From point of origin, the storm follows a northerly direction, only affecting small islands.A rare few storms, like Hurricane John, were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the Eastern/Central Pacific and moved into the western Pacific.\n\n\n== Basin monitoring ==\nWithin the Western Pacific, RSMC Tokyo-Typhoon Center, part of the Japan Meteorological Agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the Western Pacific since 1989, and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000. However each National Meteorological and Hydrological Service within the western Pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country, such as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center for United States agencies, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for interests in the island archipelago nation, and the Hong Kong Observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals.\n\n\n=== Name sources and name list ===\nThe list of names consists of entries from 14 southeast and east Asian nations and regions and the United States who have territories directly affected by typhoons. The submitted names are arranged into a list, the names on the list will be used from up to down, from left to right. When all names on the list are used, it will start again from the left-top corner. When a typhoon causes damage in a region, the affected region can request for retiring the name in the next session of the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee. A new name will be decided by the region whose name was retired. Unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world, typhoons are not named after people. Instead, they generally refer to animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names. However, Philippines (PAGASA) retains its own naming list, which consists of both human names and other things. Storms that cross the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name, but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon.\n\n\n== Records ==\nThe most active Western Pacific typhoon season was in 1964, when 39 storms of tropical storm strength formed. Only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began. The least activity seen in the northwest Pacific Ocean was during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season, when only 14 tropical storms and seven typhoons formed. In the Philippines, the most active season, since 1945, for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country. There was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the Philippines in 1958. The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957. Within Guangdong in southern China, during the past thousand years, the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670s.The highest reliably-estimated maximum sustained winds on record for a typhoon was that of Typhoon Haiyan at 314 km/h (195 mph) shortly before its landfall in the central Philippines on November 8, 2013. The most intense storm based on minimum pressure was Typhoon Tip in the northwestern Pacific Ocean in 1979, which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals (26 inHg) and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165 knots (85 m/s, 190 mph, 310 km/h). The deadliest typhoon of the 20th century was Typhoon Nina, which killed nearly 100,000 in China in 1975 due to a flood that caused 12 reservoirs to fail. After Typhoon Morakot landed in Taiwan at midnight on August 8, 2009, almost the entire southern region of Taiwan (Chiayi County/Chiayi City, Tainan County/Tainan City (now merged as Tainan), Kaohsiung County/Kaohsiung City (now merged as Kaohsiung), and Pingtung County) and parts of Taitung County and Nantou County were flooded by record-breaking heavy rain. The rainfall in Pingtung County reached 2,327 millimeters (91.6 in), breaking all rainfall records of any single place in Taiwan induced by a single typhoon, and making the cyclone the wettest known typhoon.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Pacific typhoon seasons\n2022 Pacific typhoon season\nEffects of tropical cyclones\nChina tropical cyclone rainfall climatologyFor storms that have affected countries in this basin:\n\nTropical cyclones in Malaysia\nTropical cyclones in Vietnam\nTyphoons in the Korean peninsula\nTyphoons in the Philippines\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChina Meteorological Agency\nDigital Typhoon\nHong Kong Observatory\nJapan Meteorological Agency\nMultilingual Tropical Cyclone Information\nJoint Typhoon Warning Center\nKorea Meteorological Administration\nMalaysian Meteorological Department\nNational Weather Service Guam\nPhilippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\nTaiwan Central Weather Bureau\nTCWC Jakarta (in Indonesian)\nThai Meteorological Department (in Thai)\nTyphoon2000\nVietnam's National Hydro-Meteorological Service",
    "Heman L. Ticknor House": "The Heman L. Ticknor House is a historic house in Anoka, Minnesota, United States.  It was originally built in 1867 in Gothic Revival style, then remodeled multiple times in the early 20th century to accrue substantial Queen Anne and Neoclassical elements.  The Ticknor House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for its local significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, and exploration/settlement.  It was nominated for its association with three generations of an influential local family and its representation of their evolving architectural tastes.In 1996 the home began to operate as Ticknor Hill Bed and Breakfast.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nThe first generation of Ticknors was among the original settler-colonists of Anoka who arrived and built the river town in the mid-19th century. The family opened a dry goods store in 1855 before converting it into a cigar-manufacturing business in 1860. Building upon this success, Heman Ticknor expanded the businesses to include a drug store, which he opened in 1864.In 1867, Ticknor built a new home for himself and his new wife, Ann Greenwald (n\u00e9e Sweeney). The floor plan of the structure, built in the Gothic Revival style, was in the shape of a \"T\", with the front entrance overlooking the confluence of the Rum and Mississippi Rivers. Its Gothic elements included gables, elaborate bargeboards, and arched windows in the front fa\u00e7ade. The couple installed three fireplaces, one built with locally manufactured brick.\n\n\n== Later history ==\nShortly before Heman Ticknor's death in 1897, his daughter Zale and son-in-law John Niles took up residence in the house. Later they added their own unique architectural updates. John practiced law as an attorney while Zale worked within Anoka's prominent women's organization, the Philolectian Society, to establish a city library.The couple's plans included dividing the existing structure into three sections. The front section, which faced west, switched places with the rear section, while the center portion remained intact. These subtle but significant changes gave the house a fashionable new Third Avenue South address\u2014highly desirable in 1901. Historians believe that changing the address was a major driver behind the remodel work. Other architectural changes included the addition of a tower section with Queen Anne and Neoclassical elements. A full front porch was added, along with Corinthian columns, a bay window, and a porte-coch\u00e8re.In 1913 the house passed to the next generation: Natalie Niles, daughter of John and Zale, who married Arthur Lee Smith. The couple raised their son, Ticknor Niles Smith, in the house. In 1938, after Ticknor went away to college, the Smiths added one and a half stories to the back of the house. The couple further modified the interior, dividing it into three sections for apartments.In 1977 Ticknor Smith sold the residence out of the family, at which point further renovations and extensive interior remodeling transformed the house into a duplex. In that same year, the house was nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. It achieved that recognition in 1980.By 1996, the famed house had assumed a new role as a bed and breakfast. Once again it underwent substantial remodeling, this time by its latest owners, Lynne and Terry Rickert, who created four separate rooms to accommodate guests. Exterior renovations did not result in any major changes to the structure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Anoka County, Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from MNopedia, which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.",

Indymac, however, had always been a private corporation with no relationship to the government.\nIt was heavily involved in Alt-A mortgages and reverse mortgages which in part resulted in its dramatic rise and has been suggested as the cause for its demise, as a large number of these questionable loans failed during the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007\u20132009.The FDIC put the assets up for auction and the bulk of the business was sold to IMB HoldCo LLC who turned this into OneWest Bank.  The FDIC kept some of the assets and liabilities that it could not sell in a holding entity known as IndyMac Federal Bank, which would be slowly wound down.\n\n\n== History ==\nIndyMac Bank was founded as Countrywide Mortgage Investment in 1985 by David S. Loeb and Angelo Mozilo as a means of collateralizing Countrywide Financial loans too big to be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In 1997, Countrywide spun off IndyMac as an independent company run by Mike Perry, who remained its CEO until the downfall of the bank in July 2008.\n\n\n=== Growth and acquisitions ===\nIn July 2000, IndyMac Mortgage Holdings, Inc. acquired SGV Bancorp, the parent of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of San Gabriel Valley. IndyMac changed its name to IndyMac Bank and became the ninth largest bank headquartered in California. IndyMac Bank, operating as a combined thrift and mortgage bank, provided lending for the purchase, development, and improvement of single-family housing. IndyMac Bank also issued secondary mortgages secured by such housing, and other forms of consumer credit.\nIndyMac Bancorp, a holding company headquartered in Pasadena, California, eventually acquired:\n\nFinancial Freedom, an originator and servicer of reverse mortgage loans, on July 16, 2004;\nNew York Mortgage Company, an East Coast mortgage bank, on April 2, 2007;\nBarrington Capital Corporation, a West Coast mortgage bank, in September 2007.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\nThe primary causes of IndyMac's failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion of mortgages.\nIndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the California and Florida markets, and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\nIndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate-mortgages (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market.  IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.\n\n\n=== Turning point ===\nMay 12, 2008, in a small note in the \"Capital\" section of what would become its last 10-Q released before receivership, IndyMac revealed\u2014but did not admit\u2014that it was no longer a well-capitalized institution and that it was headed for insolvency.\nIndyMac reported that during April 2008, Moody's and Standard & Poor's downgraded the ratings on a significant number of Mortgage-backed security (MBS) bonds including $160 million of those issued by Indymac and which the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. Indymac concluded that these downgrades would have negatively impacted the Company's risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect at March 31, 2008, Indymac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. Indymac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below \u201cwell capitalized\u201d (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d (8-10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds. Indymac further warned that if its level of deposit liquidity was reduced in this way, the bank anticipated that it would reduce its assets and, most likely, curtail its lending activities. This statement was comparable to those adopted by other Southern California banks that were experiencing liquidity problems, such as Pomona First Federal (PFF) and Vineyard Bank.Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits and ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits. With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31, Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30.\nIndyMac had suffered its third-consecutive quarterly loss. The bank reported that nonperforming loans totaled $1.85 billion as of March 31, increasing 40.56% from just the previous quarter. In the 10-Q filing, the company stated it expected \u201cto have an even higher level of non-performing loans in the future due to the continued market disruption\u201d.IndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer.According to IndyMac's 10-Q, the bank's risk-based capital ratio had dropped to 10.26% as of March 31, from 10.81% the previous quarter. This ratio, which factors in asset quality and loan-loss reserve coverage, needs to be at least 10% for an institution to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines. IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million it claimed it had as of March 31, 2008 was actually a fiction.\n\n\n=== Collapse ===\nWhen home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits. This \u201crun\u201d on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS. The letter outlined the Senator's concerns with IndyMac. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated.On June 26, 2008, Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, released several letters he had sent to regulators, which warned  that \u201cthe possible collapse of big mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc. poses significant financial risks to its borrowers and depositors, and regulators may not be ready to intervene to protect them\u201d. Some worried depositors began to withdraw money.On July 7, 2008, IndyMac announced on the company blog that it:\n\nHad failed to raise capital since its May 12, 2008, quarterly earnings report;\nHad been notified by bank and thrift regulators that IndyMac Bank was no longer deemed \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d;IndyMac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions, halted new loan submissions, and cut 3,800 jobs.\nOn July 8, 2008, IndyMac announced the sale of its Retail Lending Group to Prospect Mortgage Company, LLC. That day, the bank's shares closed at $0.44 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange, a loss of over 99% from its high of $50 in 2006. Additionally, analyst Paul J. Miller Jr. cut his price target on IndyMac to $0 from $1, rating the company's share price \u201cUnderperform\u201d. On July 9, Standard & Poor's cut IndyMac's counterparty credit risk rating to \u201cCCC\u201d, just a few steps above default, from \u201cB\u201d, the fifth highest junk level, and said it may cut them again. The following day, the bank's shares reached a 52-week closing low of $0.31.On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into conservatorship. A bridge bank, IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on Monday July 14, 2008. Until then, depositors would have to access their insured deposits through ATMs, their existing checks, and their existing debit cards. Telephone and Internet account access would also be restored on Monday, when the bank reopened. The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to US$100,000, and has declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount, guaranteeing 50% of any amounts in excess of $100,000. Yet, even with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings, an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million. In response, Congress increased the FDIC insurance limit to $250,000 for any bank that failed since January 1, 2008, as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, including retroactive payments to depositors for any amount up to the new limit not already covered by dividend distributions or the old $100,000 limit.\nWith $32 billion in assets, IndyMac Bank is one of the largest bank failures in American history, after the 1984 failure of Continental Illinois National Bank, with $40 billion of assets, and the 1988 failure of American Savings and Loan Association of Stockton, California. due to large losses in mortgage-backed securities.IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 31, 2008.\n\n\n=== US Senator accused of causing run ===\nIndyMac's dire condition and the failure of regulators resulted in something of a bank run after Senator Charles Schumer warned the public of them. IndyMac depositors, fearing the worst, withdrew about 7.5% of deposits from IndyMac. Shifting focus from the financial condition of the bank to Senator Schumer, regulators and others in the financial sector quickly criticized Schumer for publicly releasing his letters, which they attempted to discredit and claimed further destabilized the bank.\nLeading the criticism was John M. Reich, director of the OTS, who said that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) \u201cdo not comment on open and operating institutions\u201d. Mr. Reich spoke widely of  \u201cdissemination of incomplete or erroneous information\u201d and \u201crumors and innuendo\u201d and the \u201cstrict policy of privacy\u201d at OTS and FDIC.Mr. Reich would later be forced to remove OTS western regional director Darrel W. Dochow, for improperly allowing 5 banks to make backdated capital adjustments. On February 12, 2009, Reich would resign and step down February 27, 2009, amidst a Treasury Department investigation and audit of OTS failures and misconduct. On March 26, 2009, Scott Polakoff\u2014former OTS senior deputy director and chief operating officer, hired by Reich, who became acting director upon Reich's departure\u2014was removed and placed on leave, pending an expanded Treasury Department investigation and audit. A February 26, 2009 report by the Office of Inspector General for the Treasury Department would later conclude that IndyMac was already a doomed institution and that Prompt Corrective Action should have been taken in May 2008. The IG dismissed the idea that Mr. Schumer's letters led to the downfall of the bank.\n\n\n=== Backdating scandal ===\nIndyMac backdated an $18 million contribution from its parent company in order to preserve the bank's appearance as a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution. Mr. Dochow allowed IndyMac Bank to receive $18 million from its parent company and book the money as if it had arrived by the end of the March 31 quarter when, in fact, it had arrived on May 9, only three days before IndyMac filed the 10-Q for that March 31 quarter. Had Mr. Dochow not allowed this irregular, retroactive contribution to capital, Indymac would have been forced to report that its capital had already slipped below the minimum level that regulators require for classifying banks as well capitalized, thus putting $6.8 billion in brokered deposits\u2014or 37 percent of Indymac's total deposits\u2014at risk, as noted in the previous section. It also would have prevented IndyMac from luring new customers by offering deposit rates which exceeded the limitations prescribed in FDIC regulations. In the final two months before IndyMac was placed into receivership, it was allowed to bring in at least $90 million in new uninsured deposits.The irregularity allowed by Mr. Dochow let IndyMac hide from publicity the fact that the threat to IndyMac's brokered deposits was not just a possible outcome but was a situation which had already begun\u2014months before the disclosure of Senator Schumer's concerns about OTS and IndyMac. Investigators reported that similar officially approved backdating occurred at four other institutions.\nMr. Dochow played a central role in the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s, overriding a recommendation by federal bank examiners in San Francisco to seize Lincoln Savings, the giant savings and loan owned by Charles Keating. Lincoln became one of the biggest institutions to collapse. Mr. Keating served four and a half years in prison before his fraud and racketeering convictions were overturned. He later pleaded guilty to more limited charges, and was sentenced to the time already served.\nWilliam K. Black, a senior bank regulator during the savings and loan crisis and the author of The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One, said Mr. Dochow's lenience highlighted the longstanding unwillingness of the Office of Thrift Supervision to take charge.\n\u201cThe O.T.S. did nothing effective to regulate any of the specialized large nonprime lenders,\u201d Mr. Black said. \u201cSo what you got was what the F.B.I. accurately described as early as 2004 as an epidemic of mortgage fraud\u201d.\n\n\n=== Treasury Department Inspector General's investigation ===\nOn February 26, 2009, the Treasury Department's inspector general concluded that federal regulators failed to catch warning signs that presaged the IndyMac Bank's collapse. The U.S. government watchdog said the Pasadena, Calif., savings and loan pursued an overly aggressive growth strategy that included failing to verify borrowers' income and relying on expensive deposits to fund its operations. The Office of Thrift Supervision, IndyMac's regulator, recognized the red flags but did nothing to stop them, the Treasury inspector general said.\n\u201cWe found that OTS identified numerous problems and risks, including the quantity and poor quality of nontraditional mortgage products,\u201d the report said. Yet the \u201cOTS did not take aggressive action to stop those practices from continuing to proliferate,\u201d according to the report.\nThe report also rejected much of the blame targeted at Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) Mr. Schumer came under fire last year (June 2008) for making public a letter he sent to regulators questioning IndyMac's ability to stay afloat as a business.\nThe Treasury inspector general found that the letter was a \u201ccontributing factor\u201d in the timing of IndyMac's collapse, but that \u201cthe underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated\u201d.\n\u201cAlso, the thrift was already on a course for probable failure by the time Mr. Schumer's letter was made public,\u201d the report said.On March 27, 2009, A spokesman said the U.S. Treasury Inspector General is reviewing actions by the Office of Thrift Supervision on backdating banks\u2019 capital injections after the regulator's acting director was removed and placed on leave. Inspector General Eric Thorson gave findings \u201cregarding certain actions by management\u201d at OTS to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, replaced Acting Director Scott Polakoff pending an investigation, according to separate statements. John Bowman, the deputy director and chief counsel, was named the agency's acting director, OTS said. The OTS permitted five banks, including failed lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc., to revise capital reports for the first quarter to show higher levels after the period ended. The action allowed lenders, such as IndyMac, to avoid further regulatory restriction.\n\n\n=== Other investigations ===\nOn June 30, 2008, the Center for Responsible Lending, a Washington think tank, released a report compiling information from various lawsuits filed by customers and former employees of IndyMac Bank, and alleged that managers and supervisors were being pressured to approve loans or risk being fired. Before its collapse, IndyMac denied the allegations in the report.On July 16, 2008, an unnamed US government official said that the FBI was investigating IndyMac for possible fraud. While it is not clear if the investigation began before the bank was taken over by the FDIC, the investigation appears to have been focused on the company itself, and not individuals within the company.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2008 United States bank failures\nSubprime mortgage crisis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFDIC Failed Bank Information",
    "Zab\u0142ocki": "See also Zablocki, Zablocki v. Redhail.\nZab\u0142ocki (feminine: Zab\u0142ocka, plural: Zab\u0142occy) is the name of a Polish aristocratic family of ancient lineage (Jastrz\u0119biec) and Coat of arms \u0141ada, who assumed the name of Zab\u0142ocki after acquisition of Zab\u0142ocie Pu\u0142tuskie in Wielkopolska in the year 1500.

His properties in Rybno included a manufacture of soap which he intended to export abroad via the port in Gda\u0144sk.  Transported by river, the barge had to pass Prussian border.  In order to avoid high tariffs, Zab\u0142ocki decided to smuggle the soap by placing waterproofed crates underwater, dragged at a distance behind the barge.  He successfully passed the customs, but alas, the waterproofing on not a single crate held, leading to a total loss of cargo.",

    "Fraud-on-the-market theory": "The fraud-on-the-market theory is the idea that stock prices are a function of all material information about the company and its business. It applies to securities markets, where it can be assumed that all material information is available to investors. The theory states that under these conditions, there is a causal link between any misstatement and any stock purchaser, because the misstatements defraud the entire market and thus affect the price of the stock. Therefore, a material misstatement's effect on an individual purchaser is no less significant than the effect on the entire market.\nAccording to this theory, \"When an investor buys or sells stock at the market price, his or her reliance may be presumed, assuming that he or she pleads that: (1) the information allegedly misrepresented was publicly known, (2) it was material, (3) the stock was traded in an efficient market, and (4) the plaintiff traded in the stock in the relevant period.\"Fraud on the market theory applies to civil enforcement of SEC Rule 10b-5 which \"prohibits any act or omission resulting in fraud or deceit in connection with the purchase or sale of any security\".

    "Oconomowoc High School": "Oconomowoc High School is a public high school located in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, United States. It is part of the Oconomowoc Area School District. As of the 2019\u201320 school year, it had 1,669 students.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first Oconomowoc High School was built in 1923.\nOconomowoc's mascot is Rocky, a raccoon. The mascot was formerly named Cooney, which was changed due to the negative connotation of that word. As of 2018, the name was still being used in connection with Oconomowoc athletics.\n\n\n== Service area ==\nWithin Waukesha County it serves: Oconomowoc, Oconomowoc Lake, the county's portion of Lac La Belle, most of Summit, and most of Okauchee Lake.Within Jefferson County it serves Ixonia and that county's section of Lac La Belle.Within Dodge County it serves Ashippun.\n\n\n== Interscholastic sports ==\n\n\n=== Wisconsin Little Ten All-Sport Champions ===\nThe Wisconsin Little Ten Conference has been appointing All-Sport Champions since the 2004\u20132005 school year. Oconomowoc High School has won six times, including five consecutive wins from 2011 through 2016.\n\n\n=== Classic 8 Conference ===\nBeginning with the 2017\u20132018 school year, Oconomowoc High School joined the Wisconsin Classic 8 conference, as part of a major athletics realignment that affected most of Southeastern Wisconsin. As a result of the realignment, the Wisconsin Little Ten Conference was disbanded.\n\n\n=== Football ===\nOn September 27, 2013, Oconomowoc football was recognized statewide and garnered national interest, as the Raccoons (5-0) faced the Wisconsin Lutheran Vikings (3-2) in Oconomowoc's homecoming game. History was made when Oconomowoc beat Wisconsin Lutheran 84\u201382 in regulation. The teams combined for 166 total points, surpassing the previous state record of 133 points. Oconomowoc quarterback Canton Larson scored 8 touchdowns, including a 493-yard performance, combined through the air and on the ground. The game showcased the best the Wisconsin Little Ten Conference had to offer, with 25 combined All-Conference players. In its 2013 campaign, the Oconomowoc football program led a memorable season, winning the conference for the first time since 2002, while going undefeated during the regular season. They lost in a state quarterfinal match-up against Mukwonago, finishing the year with a record of 11\u20131.Much of Oconomowoc's football dominance came under legendary coach Ed Rux. In his 33-year tenure beginning in 1967, Rux led Oconomowoc to 216 victories. He oversaw ten conference titles, including a trip to the Division 1 state finals in 1987. He was inducted into the Wisconsin Football Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 1999, the year of his retirement. In 2014, the OHS football stadium was renovated and renamed; it is now known as the Ed Rux Stadium.\n\n\n=== Baseball ===\nThe Raccoons have been a successful baseball program since the 1900s. The baseball program has won conference 25 times, including 14 trips to the state tournament. William Martin led Oconomowoc to their first state championship in 1959. They defeated Tomahawk 10\u20130, Monona Grove 7\u20133, and Fond du Lac 2\u20131 to win the title. Pat Neary took over varsity baseball in 1984 and picked up where Martin left off. The Raccoons were conference champions in 1984, 1985, and 1986. They were state runners-up in 1991 and 1996. Neary coached Oconomowoc baseball for 41 years (2 as freshman, 12 as junior varsity and 27 as varsity). He held a varsity record of 339\u2013230.

    "Little Muppet Monsters": "Little Muppet Monsters is a Saturday morning television series featuring the Muppets that aired three episodes on CBS in 1985. The first season of Muppet Babies did so well in the ratings, that CBS decided to expand the series from a half-hour to an hour, pairing Muppet Babies with Little Muppet Monsters. They called the hour-long package Muppets, Babies and Monsters.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe show was anchored by three young Muppet monsters: Tug (performed by Richard Hunt), Molly (performed by Camille Bonora), and Boo (performed by David Rudman). The three have started their own basement show following an incident where Scooter has them put in the basement after Molly and Boo played water polo in the living room. They are joined by Nicky Napoleon (performed by James Kroupa) and his Emperor Penguins as their music act.\n\n\n== Production ==\nStoryboard director Scott Shaw discussed the show in MuppetZine issue #3 (Winter 1993). \"The concept of this second half-hour was neither simple nor particularly well-developed,\" he said. \"A trio of new (live-action) Muppet Monster Kids, working from the basement of the adult Muppets' home, create their own television station which broadcasts only to the TV sets in the house upstairs. Their 'shows' were such regular segments as \"Pigs in Space: The Animated Series\", \"Kermit the Frog, Private Eye\", \"Muppet Sport Shorts\" with Animal, \"Gonzo's Freaky Facts and Oddball Achievements,\" and \"Fozzie's Comedy Corner\", among others.\nAlthough thirteen episodes were produced (most  of which were incomplete at the time of cancellation), only three of them ever aired. According to Muppet performer Kathryn Mullen, and the Henson Company archives, Marvel Productions failed to deliver the full season's animated segments in time for airing. CBS responded by rerunning episodes of Muppet Babies to fill the second half hour until Marvel finished the series' animated segments. Due to high ratings from the Muppet Babies reruns, the network decided not to pick up the remaining episodes of Little Muppet Monsters. The three completed episodes never appeared on television after their initial air dates. Plans to officially re-release the three episodes have not been made.\nDespite its quick cancellation, the theme song to Little Muppet Monsters lived on; the instrumental version of the song became the closing theme for Muppet Babies and remained so until the show ended in 1991.\nIn 1991, segments of the animated \"Pigs in Space\" and \"Kermit the Frog, Private Eye\" from the second episode of Little Muppet Monsters titled \"Space Cowboys\" were re-shown in the final episode of Muppet Babies titled \"Eight Flags Over the Nursery\".\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n=== Muppet performers ===\n\nRichard Hunt as Tug Monster, Scooter, and Janice\nCamille Bonora as Molly Monster\nDavid Rudman as Boo Monster\nJim Henson as Kermit the Frog and Dr. Teeth\nFrank Oz as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Animal\nJerry Nelson as Floyd Pepper\nDave Goelz as Gonzo and  Zoot\nPam Arciero as Penguin\nCheryl Blalock as Cow, Raggmopp\nMichael Earl Davis as Penguin\nJim Kroupa as Nicky Napoleon\nNoel MacNeal as Rat, Cow, Magic Book\nKathryn Mullen as Penguin, Rat\nMartin P.

    "Teresa Hooley": "Teresa Mary Hooley (1888\u20131973) was an English poet, known in later life as Mrs. F. H. Butler. She is known mostly for her war poem A War Film, about World War I.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nShe was born in Risley, Derbyshire, and (accordingly to a letter from her sold at auction recently) she lived at Goldenbrook Farm in Risley at some point during her life. Teresa Mary Hooley's early life was spent at Risley Lodge, the home of her father Terah Hooley (died 1927), a successful lace manufacturer who built Springfield Mill at Sandiacre, and her mother Mary (died 1928), his second wife. She made her name before the Great War, writing poems in the Daily Mirror alongside Edith Sitwell \u2013 not an admirer of her work. During the war, she presumably had an interest in Spiritualism, since her poem \"Christ of the Night\" appeared in the Occult Review in December 1915, on p. 342. Her work was published in a number of collections in the 1920s and 1930s but has largely fallen out of fashion. One of her poems, \"The Owl\" (Sova) was published in a 1939 Czech language compilation of animal poetry. She had two full brothers who survived childhood. Of these the younger, Basil Terah Hooley, born in 1893, was decorated in the Great War but died in the 1918 flu pandemic. Her much older half-brother was the financier Ernest Terah Hooley of Risley Hall with whom she maintained a civil if frosty relationship. Hooley married Frank H. Butler in May 1920 at Risley Church. They had a son but the marriage did not survive. In later life some found her a formidable presence.\n\n\n== A War Film ==\nHooley's poem A War Film describes the experience of seeing documentary footage of World War I, and refers to the Retreat from Mons, after one of the great battles of the Great War.\nAlthough this is Hooley's most well known poem little is known about it, and its date has been debated in online fora. It has been assumed the poem was inspired by watching documentary footage about World War I. The earliest documentary was The Battle of the Somme (1916), but it is unlikely that a contemporary writer would confuse the Battle of the Somme and the Retreat from Mons. It is therefore reasonable to conjecture that the 1926 film, Mons, was the most probable source. The fact that the poem can be found in Songs of all Seasons (published 1927) could be seen to bear this hypothesis out.\n\n\n== Works ==\nGloom and Gleam (1913, A.C.

    "Lancia Trevi": "The Lancia Trevi (Type 828), initially marketed as the Lancia Beta Trevi, is a saloon car that was produced between 1980 and 1984. It has transversely mounted in-line four-cylinder engines driving the front wheels. Its engines have twin overhead camshafts and electronic ignition. The clutch is a single dry plate with diaphragm and a five-speed gearbox was standard. The suspension consists of MacPherson struts all round with coil springs and anti-roll bar. The wheels are fitted with 185/65 14 inch tyres (Pirelli P6). Steering is rack and pinion. The manufacturer's estimated fuel consumption is 29.4 mpg (9,6l/100 km) at 75 mph for the 1600 manual and 28 mpg (10,1l/100 km) at 75 mph for the 2000 manual. The 2000 fitted with an automatic transmission had an official fuel consumption of 25.4 mpg (11,1l/100 km) at 75 mph.The Lancia Beta Trevi was presented at the Turin Auto Show in May 1980. It was presented to the UK market at the Birmingham Motor Show of November 1980. Much of the car was derived from the Lancia Beta. The most powerful version of the Trevi was introduced in 1982 - this Volumex (VX) version had a supercharger. The name stems from the Italian \"Tre Volumi\" (three-box).\n\n\n== History ==\nDeveloped from the Lancia Beta, the Trevi (or Beta Trevi as it was called until 1983) was introduced in 1980. The chief engineer for the Beta was Sergio Camuffo who was also responsible for the original Beta and the Gamma and numerous other models. The Beta, which was fitted with the same interior as the Trevi, was sold for two years alongside the Trevi (and sold as the Beta Berlina) Sales literature from Lancia emphasised that the car was both luxurious and sporting in nature. Lancia's intention was that the restyled Beta would help to re-establish Lancia's credibility after the debacle of the rusting Betas: \"Lancia's position took an unreasonably big knock as a result of the revelation that they were buying back cars with corroded sub-frame mounting points...a new Lancia today - thanks to the over-compensation that was necessary to make their point - promises to be as rust resistant as any of its rivals\" wrote UK's Autocar in 1981. The review continued to say the Trevi was \"a conventional three-box saloon...it is a Beta under its skin but most of the body panels and the interior are completely new.\" The sales literature explained that the designers set out to create a classic three-box notchback saloon. The appearance of the car drew this comment from Autocar: \"The Trevi is, to most eyes, a rather curious looking car, an odd combination of curves and angles, that produces an incipient spoiler from the slight upturn at the rear of the roof panel\". The introduction of a saloon body-style was part of a general conservative trend in which existing fastback cars or unusually-styled cars were given more conventional appearances. The VW Golf body was given a boot in 1979 to become the VW Jetta, the Citro\u00ebn Visa gained a grille as did the Fiat Ritmo, and the fastback Simca 1307 was restyled with a boot and sold as a Solara, and the Saab 900 was sold in booted form as the 900 CD \"The residents of Staid Lane\" wrote Tumminelli, \"preferred conformity...as a courtesy to Reagan, Thatcher and Kohl, the old-fashioned saloon, standard bearer of the bourgeoisie, must be reanimated\".\n\nThe Trevi was available initially with two engines, a 1600 and 2000, both fitted with Weber or Solex carburetors. In the UK automatic transmission was optional only on the larger engined cars. In 1981 Bosch electronic ignition was made available on the 2000IE models. This allowed the engine to produce 122 CV at 6400 rpm (compared to 115 CV at 5500 rpm). The Trevi Volumex was the last version of the car, introduced in 1982 at the Turin motor show  and designed to improve performance without affecting fuel economy. Fitted with a twin scroll Roots-type supercharger (and carburettors, rather than the expected fuel injection), this increased output to 135 CV (99 kW). This development meant the Trevi was the first car fitted with a mechanically driven supercharger in nearly five decades if not considering the 131 Volumetrico since it was a limited production run. It had revised front seats, a matt-black chin spoiler and plusher trim, with the seats upholstered in Zegna materials. As for the 2000IE, the Volumex also received a much-praised power steering from ZF as standard. Lancia UK did not import this version of the car to Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The carburetted 2000 was discontinued during 1983, and production of the Trevi overall was discontinued in 1984. In total 36,784 examples of the Trevi were produced.One interesting special model was a single \"Trevi Bimotore\" built by ex-Abarth engineer Giorgio Pianta in 1984. This car allowed Pirelli to carry out tire testing for the upcoming street version of the Lancia Delta S4. To provide all-wheel drive and equivalent power, this unique car was equipped with a second engine in the rear, necessitating large air intakes on the rear doors. The engines were lightly tuned Volumex units (using smaller pulleys to increase boost pressure), providing 150 CV each for a total of 300 CV (221 kW).\n\n\n== Critical appraisal ==\n\nThe Lancia Trevi was not met with a warm reception, drawing criticism from the UK press with only a few exceptions. The British magazine, CAR, wrote: \"Ungainly new Trevi notchback worth a giggle, and the new Swiss cheese Beta dashboard is eye-popping\" (this was the same dashboard as in the Trevi). The dashboard was a cause of some controversy. Mario Bellini, the interior's designer, describes the design thus: \"A complex architecture of interiors in a small, very restricted space. A challenge tackled by the architect from a structural, and not purely aesthetic, angle \". Contemporary automotive journals described the dashboard as ugly, gimmicky and overstyled, resembling Swiss cheese, or having the appearance of something from the US television drama Star Trek. A review of the Volumex model commented that the \"\u00b4Star Wars' fascia remains a disaster\". A 2014 review of the Volumex model in Klassik Autobild described the dashboard as \"hardly a masterwork\" but also as \"audacious\".\n\n\n=== Trevi 2000 ===\nThe UK's weekly Autocar reviewed the Lancia Trevi 2000 in August 1981. The article was the cover story for that issue. The front cover featured the Bellini-styled interior under the headline \"Cutting a new dash...Lancia's Trevi tested.\"\nThe car's strong points were described as generally very good handling, good steering in urban areas, generous equipment and a powerful engine. The weak points were the car's poor packaging, confusing dashboard, poor ergonomics, poorly designed seats, tendency to lift-off oversteer and high fuel consumption. The Autocar verdict was that the Lancia Trevi had \"the performance and economy to appeal to Lancia enthusiasts.\"\nThe article opened with an explanation that the Trevi was designed as a means to restore confidence lost during the Lancia Beta rust debacle where sales fell from 11,000 a year in 1977 to 7,000 in 1980. The car was reviewed under several headings: Performance, Economy, Noise, Road Behaviour, Brakes, Behind the Wheel and Living With the Car.\nUnder Performance, the car was criticised for torque steer. Though it had a \"ponderous, clunky gearchange\" the gearbox was spaced to require frequent use to find the balance between maximum power and maximum torque. 72% of the car's weight was over the front wheels. 115 bhp was deemed only adequate to pull what the author viewed as too much weight for a car of its size (1,184 kilos).\nUnder Testing, the car returned an average of 23 mpg (Imp.) though cautious driving meant 30 mpg was achievable. Autocar viewed the test figures as an improvement over the 24 mpg achieved by the Lancia Beta or the 20.3 mpg of the Lancia HPE of 1977. Fuel filling was \"easy and clean.\" The Trevi's suspension was tuned around the Pirelli P6 radial ply tyre of size 185/65HR 14 inches. Autocar's view was that the result of this was that the Trevi was thus \"among the ranks of the best handling saloons.\" Steering was \"pleasantly light around town\" but was too light for rapid, cross-country driving. The car's natural tendency was for understeer and predictable behaviour. However, the car was also capable of lift-off oversteer if the throttle was closed suddenly while cornering. Braking during the lift-off oversteer would  cause the car to \"viciously tighten its line, not something to be tried on a wet surface.\"\nThe 250 mm (9.8 in) brakes were described as not being outstandingly large, \"soft\" and \"lacking immediate bite.\" However, the brakes performed well during fade tests. The handbrake could hold the car on a 1 in 4 slope but not a 1 in 3.\nUnder the heading of Noise, the twin-cam engine was described as sounding \"unobtrusive.\" Wind noise was low and tyre and suspension noise was \"generally low\". Autocar addressed the matter of the interior design by calling it \"unusual\" and gave a full description of the dashboard which was called \"confusing\" for the driver and \"boring\" for the passenger\". The seats were described as \"disappointing, especially when the car's potentially high lateral g forces in cornering a taken into account\". The seats did not provide enough sideways bolstering. Legroom in the rear was \"limited\" as was rear headroom. The lack of interior storage for oddments was described as a \"glaring omission\".\nAutocar viewed the Lancia Trevi 2000 as competing with the following cars: the Alfa Romeo Alfetta 2.0, the Citro\u00ebn CX Athena, the Fiat Mirafiori Sport, the Renault 20 TX and the Saab 900 GLS saloon. Of these the Trevi had the highest top speed (113 mph max speed), fourth fastest 0-60 mph time (11.1 seconds) and third best average consumption of 25.2 mpg.\nReferring to the Volumex model Autocar magazine reported that despite the fitting of a Roots-style positive displacement supercharger \"fuel economy is not penalised; an overall consumption of around 28 mpg has been quoted by Lancia\".The view of the UK's Car magazine in November 1981 was that the Trevi's main strength was handling with strong grip and \"truly excellent balance that pleases and rewards a keen driver\". The magazine cross-compared the Trevi 2000 with Citro\u00ebn's CX Reflex and the Saab 900 GLs. The Lancia Trevi won the test, being \"the fastest and best handling of the trio\". The car's principle demerits were its \"bland\" \"inappropriately conservative styling\" and the dashboard which was \"diabolical to use.\" The front seats were considered as lacking in lumbar support. CAR's opinion was favourable concerning the performance which it described as being due to the evenly-spread close ratios which had \"a fairly low first and a top which allows the engine to go past peak power at maximum speed.\" This gave the Lancia \"a distinct edge in terms of lower overall gearing.\" This helped because the Lancia had more torque and a lower weight than the cars to which it was being compared. Also relative to the test cars, the Lancia had a gearchange \"as slick as silk with well-judged spring loading into the third/fourth plane, and appeared to need no more than a quick dip of the clutch to snatch changes\". The Lancia came second to the Citro\u00ebn in fuel consumption. The Lancia's test consumption was 24 mpg to the Citro\u00ebn CX 2.0 litre's 27.9 mpg. Under the heading of comfort, the Lancia's springing and damping were praised for their gentle firmness though it was bested by the Saab 900 GLs. The driver's seat received commendation for its general comfort, being softer than the Saab and allowing more freedom to change position than the Citro\u00ebn CX. The seats was felt to lack lumbar support. Under accommodation the Trevi's rear passenger room was viewed as being sufficient, on a par with the Saab. Only comparatively did the luggage volume lose points, due to the other two tested cars being \"exceptional\". Under the heading of driver appeal the Trevi was \"badly let down by the gimmicky and over-styled fascia design\". Visibility was held to be \"good\" due to the car's squared-off extremities. The main beam was good but the dipped beam described as \"miserable\" and \"falling short of the point of safety if the car is being driven fast.\" Due to the chassis layout, steering characteristics and the choice of tyre, CAR's view was that the handling was very consistent with high levels of grip and a readiness to hold the required line of driving during cornering. Lifting off the throttle during cornering caused slight over-steer by \"a few degrees.\"\nDrive and Trail carried out a full test of the Lancia Trevi 2000. The car was viewed as a competitor to the Ford Cortina 2000 Ghia and Vauxhall Cavalier. The quoted price was 7,421 GBP. \"Beneath the Trevi's conventional slab-fronted bonnet sits an extrovert twin-cam motor that's coupled to a close ratio five-speed gearbox... Mastering our car's fiery Latin temperament was a test of our tester's patience. It started out well enough on the auto choke, but the engine stuttered and spluttered along until the coolant's temperature needle was well into its normal running zone. The snag is that on a cold morning this can take up to three miles (5 km) to achieve. Worse still were the antics that follow the restarting of the test car's semi-warm engine. Each time the throttle was re-applied the engine's power disappeared like a rocket into a black hole - only to reappear just as suddenly to blast the Trevi away. It's annoying, it's embarrassing and it happens to other Trevis we have heard about.\" Balancing this, the author went on to write: \"Once the Trevi has passed through these warm up tantrums, it's a reformed character. The engine's response is usually crisp and clean, the exceptions being the mild fuel starvation when the Trevi is cornered enthusiastically and minor plug fouling after prolonged low-speed crawling. The latter is generally cured by a generous dose of a heavy right foot on the accelerator\".On the general performance Drive and Trail continued: \"It's a performance saloon that goes like a real sport: acceleration is as sparkling as an Alfa Romeo's or BMW's. If you enjoy rapid gear changing and keeping the tachometer's needle swinging around its red sector you'll find the Trevi a quick and rewarding car [...] one of the most appealing features of the engine is its wide spread of useable power and its tolerance of inappropriate gear selection.\" The writer commented that the selection of gear ratios might be well suited to ascending the mountain passes in the Trevi's homeland but that the ratios were inappropriate for steady motorway cruising. It was suggested a higher top gear might have been a better solution.\nThe clutch was criticized for being too heavy and the gear change affected by over-spring towards the third and fourth positions. Power steering was standard on the two-litre model in the UK. The design was praised for its unobtrusiveness, correct ratio and the accuracy of its action. The caveat was that \"as usual though there is little feedback from the front tyres as the nose of the car nudges wide of the line on fast corners\". About the tyres the comment was that \"Lancia's engineers have honed the Trevi's handling so finely that only one make of tyre is approved, Pirelli's P6. It's a low profile tyre that gives a very high standard of grip in all weathers, and contributes to the well-balanced 'feel' of the car during rapid cornering.\" In the summary the steering was viewed as being much better than the regular Beta's.\nAbout the driving position Drive and Trail commented: \"Accepting that the Trevi is an accomplished, exciting car, it's all the more annoying that the driving position is so poor.\" The seats had a good view out but lacked lateral support and spinal support. The test reported an average fuel consumption of 25 mpg\u2011imp (11 L/100 km; 21 mpg\u2011US) (3 mpg worse than the class norm) and realistic range of 250 miles (400 km). The fuel tank held 11.4 imp gal (52 L; 13.7 US gal). The dashboard, designed by Italian architect Mario Bellini, was derogatorily compared to Gruy\u00e8re cheese and \"drew not one word of praise during our fortnight's testing.\" In 1982 What Car? copied the criticism: \"[the] interior is also bizarre, featuring a curious and ineffective Gruy\u00e8re cheese fascia\". The packaging was criticised for being poor with less space for rear passengers than in the Beta, a lack of oddments space in the cabin and a glove box that was too small. The ventilation came in for criticism: \"During our wintry test we were frequently fiddling with the controls in a vain attempt to get a comfortable atmosphere.\"\nThe overall summary of the author was that the Trevi was a \"dynamic machine that makes fast driving on secondary roads a pleasure.\"\nWhat Car? published a comparison test of the Lancia Trevi in March 1982. The Trevi 2000 was tested against the Citro\u00ebn CX Reflex 2 litre and the Saab 900 GL 2.0 litre. The Trevi came last. The case against it was that the Trevi \"has less to recommend it [than the CX and 900]. It is a reasonably good performer and moderately enjoyable to drive\" but the few positive aspects of its design were outweighed by various demerits. The Trevi \"fails to arouse enthusiasm the way a good Italian car should, and its ungainly rear end and cramped accommodation were further drawbacks.\"In a discussion about the Lancia HPE to which the Trevi was related, LJK Setright of the UK's CAR magazine reported that the Trevi \"...surprised me by its ability to maintain high speeds on rural roads....\".\n\n\n=== Trevi Volumex ===\n\nMotor magazine conducted a short test of the Trevi Volumex model in 1982. While other manufacturers were pursuing turbocharging as a means to boost power, Lancia used mechanical forced induction, in order to give the impression of driving a larger engined car rather than a tuned one. The result was a car that \"doesn\u00b4t feel quick...in short the Lancia's straight line performance has plenty of soul but little sparkle\". Apart from the changes in performance, Motor reported that the car exhibited \"the usual Trevi traits, good, bad and indifferent. The gearchange falls into the latter category - reasonably positive but somewhat clonky - though the intermediate ratios are nicely spaced. The well-balanced handling and fine grip remain first class and the ride is surprisingly supple\".The Trevi Volumex was also tested in continental Europe, with similar conclusions to those reached by British testers. A Belgian test praised the steering, while wondering where the performance went. Instead of the promised 9.6 second 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) time, it took them 11.2 seconds. Other performance figures were very little improved over or even worse than those of a 2000IE tested earlier, in part due to longer gearing (which still failed to provide a higher top speed). Fuel consumption was as promised, until one tried to access some of the performance promised by the supercharger, when it became very high indeed. Interior fittings and finish received high grades, except for the \"bizarre\" dash. The conclusion (stated repeatedly) was that a fuel injected Trevi Turbo would have made a much better car, and that the considerably cheaper 2000IE was just as fast and had lower fuel consumption than the Volumex.\n\n\n=== Trevi 1600 ===\nBy April 1983 CAR had this to say about the Trevi - which was by then only available as a 1.6 saloon. \"For: Comfortable, roomy, cocoon-like body. Against: Lacks hatchback; 2.0 litre (now finished) was a better thing. Sum-up: Nice car once; left behind by lack of development. Lack of supporting range makes it an orphan. Hurts resale.\" At this time the entire Lancia range was relegated to the category of \"Adequate\" in CAR Magazine's listings section.\n\n\n== Engines ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Alan C. Parker": "Sir Alan William Parker  (14 February 1944 \u2013 31 July 2020) was an English filmmaker. His early career, beginning in his late teens, was spent as a copywriter and director of television advertisements. After about ten years of filming adverts, many of which won awards for creativity, he began screenwriting and directing films.\nParker was known for using a wide range of filmmaking styles and working in differing genres. He directed musicals, including Bugsy Malone (1976), Fame (1980), Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall (1982), The Commitments (1991) and Evita (1996); true-story dramas, including Midnight Express (1978), Mississippi Burning (1988), Come See the Paradise (1990) and Angela's Ashes (1999); family dramas, including Shoot the Moon (1982), and horrors and thrillers including Angel Heart (1987) and The Life of David Gale (2003).His films won nineteen BAFTA awards, ten Golden Globes and six Academy Awards. His film Birdy was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the Top Ten Films of 1984, and won the Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury prize at the 1985 Cannes Film Festival. Parker was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the British film industry and knighted in 2002. He was active in both British cinema and American cinema, along with being a founding member of the Directors Guild of Great Britain and lecturing at various film schools.\nIn 2000 he received the Royal Photographic Society Lumi\u00e8re Award for major achievement in cinematography, video or animation.  In 2013 he received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest honour the British Film Academy can give a filmmaker. Parker donated his personal archive to the British Film Institute's National Archive in 2015.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nParker was born into a working-class family in Islington, North London, the son of Elsie Ellen, a dressmaker, and William Leslie Parker, a house painter. He grew up on a council estate of Islington, which always made it easy for him to remain \"almost defiantly working-class in attitudes\" said the British novelist and screenwriter Ray Connolly. Parker said that although he had his share of fun growing up, he always felt he was studying for his secondary school exams, while his friends were out having a good time. He had an \"ordinary background\" with no aspirations to become a film director, nor did anyone in his family have any desire to be involved in the film industry. The closest he ever came, he said, to anything related to films was learning photography, a hobby inspired by his uncles: \"That early introduction to photography is something I remember.\"Parker attended Dame Alice Owen's School, concentrating on science in his last year. He left school when he was eighteen to work in the advertising field, hoping that the advertising industry might be a good way to meet girls.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== 1962\u20131975: Early work and breakthrough ===\nHis first job was office boy in the post room of an advertising agency. But more than anything, he said, he wanted to write, and would write essays and ads when he got home after work. His colleagues also encouraged him to write, which soon led him to a position as a copywriter in the company. Parker took jobs with different agencies over the next few years, having by then become proficient as a copywriter. One such agency was Collett Dickenson Pearce in London, where he first met the future producers David Puttnam and Alan Marshall, both of whom would later produce many of his films. Parker credited Puttnam with inspiring him and talking him into writing his first film script, Melody (1971).\nBy 1968, Parker had moved from copywriting to successfully directing numerous television advertisements. In 1970, he joined Alan Marshall to establish a company to make advertisements. That company eventually became one of Britain's best commercial production houses, winning nearly every major national and international award open to it. Among their award-winning adverts were the UK Cinzano vermouth advertisement (starring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter), and a Heineken advert which used one hundred actors. Parker credited his years writing and directing adverts for his later success as a film director: Looking back, I came from a generation of filmmakers who couldn't have really started anywhere but commercials, because we had no film industry in the United Kingdom at the time. People like Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, Adrian Lyne, Hugh Hudson, and myself. So commercials proved to be incredibly important.After writing the screenplay for the Waris Hussein film Melody in 1971, Parker shot his first fictional film titled No Hard Feelings in 1973, for which he wrote the script. The film is a bleak love story set against the Blitz in London during the Second World War, when the Luftwaffe bombed the city for 57 consecutive nights. Parker was born during one of those bombing raids, and said \"the baby in that [film] could well have been me\". With no feature film directing experience, he could not find financial backing, and decided to risk using his own money and funds from mortgaging his house to cover the cost. The film impressed the BBC, which bought the film and showed it on television a few years later, in 1976. The BBC producer Mark Shivas had, in the interim, also contracted Parker to direct The Evacuees (1975), a Second World War story written by Jack Rosenthal which was shown as a Play for Today. The work was based on true events which involved the evacuation of school children from central Manchester for protection. The Evacuees won a BAFTA for best TV drama and also an Emmy for best International Drama.Parker next wrote and directed his first feature film, Bugsy Malone (1976), a parody of early American gangster films and American musicals, but with only child actors. Parker's desire in making the film was to entertain both children and adults with a unique concept and style of film:\n\nI'd worked a lot with kids and I had four very young children of my own at the time. When you do have young children like that you're very sensitive to the kind of materials that's available for them ... The only kind of movies they could see were Walt Disney movies ... I thought it would be nice to make a movie that would be good for the kids, and also the adults that had to take them. So to be absolutely honest, Bugsy Malone was a pragmatic exercise to break into American film.\nThe film received eight British Academy Award nominations and five Awards, including two BAFTAs for Jodie Foster.\n\n\n=== 1978\u20131990: Subsequent success ===\nParker next directed Midnight Express (1978), based on a true account by Billy Hayes, about his incarceration and escape from a Turkish prison for trying to smuggle hashish out of the country. Parker made the film in order to do something radically different from Bugsy Malone, which would broaden his style of filmmaking. The script was written by Oliver Stone in his first screenplay, and won Stone his first Academy Award. The music was composed by Giorgio Moroder, who was also awarded his first Oscar for the film. Midnight Express established Parker as a \"front rank director\", as both he and the film were Oscar nominated. The success of that film also gave him the freedom from then on to direct films of his own choosing.Parker then directed Fame (1980), which follows the lives of eight students through their years at the New York City's High School of Performing Arts. It was a huge box-office success and led to a television spin-off series of the same name. Parker stated that after doing a serious drama like Midnight Express, he wanted to do a film with music, but very different from typical musicals of the past:\nI didn't want this sort of classy MGM musical where you stop and then there's the musical number. I wanted it to come out in real situations, which it kind of does ... I went to the school and I hung out with the kids for quite a few months ... I think so much of the stuff I put into the film came out of the kids.\nThe actress Irene Cara recalls that \"the nice thing about the way Alan works with everyone is that he allowed us to really feel like classmates.\" However, Parker was refused permission to use the actual school portrayed in the film, the High School for the Performing Arts, because of the notoriety he achieved from his previous film, Midnight Express. The head of the school district told him, \"Mr. Parker, we can't risk you doing for New York high school the same thing you did for Turkish prisons.\"Parker's next film was Shoot the Moon (1982), the story of a marital break-up that takes place in Northern California. Parker calls it \"the first grown-up film that I'd done\". He again chose to direct a subject distinctly different from his previous film, explaining, \"I really try to do different work. I think that by doing different work each time, it keeps you creatively fresher.\" He described the theme of the film being about \"two people who can't live together but who also can't let go of one another. A story of fading love, senseless rage, and the inevitable bewildering betrayal in the eyes of the children.\" Its stars, Albert Finney and Diane Keaton, received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.The film also had a personal significance for Parker, who said he was forced to examine his own marriage: \"It was a painful film to make for me because there were echoes of my own life in it. It was about a breakup of a marriage, and the children in the story were quite close to my own children in age. Shoot the Moon was very, very close to my own life.\" He spent days with the writer Bo Goldman on developing a realistic story, and states that his marriage became \"infinitely stronger as a result of the film\".Also in 1982 the Parker directed, Roger Waters written and with graphics by the cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, film version of the Pink Floyd conceptual rock opera,  \"Pink Floyd - The Wall\" starring Boomtown Rats frontman Bob Geldof as the fictive rocker \"Pink\" was released. Parker later described the filming as \"one of the most miserable experiences of my creative life.\"Parker directed Birdy (1984), starring Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. It recounts the story of two school friends who have returned from the Vietnam war but were both psychologically and physically injured. Parker called it a \"wonderful story\" after having read the book by William Wharton. However, because of the nature of the story, he had no idea how to make it into a movie: \"I didn't know if you could take the poetry of the book and make it cinematic poetry, or if an audience would actually want it.\"The film became a critical success. Richard Schickel says that Parker had \"transcended realism ... [and] achieved his personal best\", while Derek Malcolm considers Birdy to be Parker's \"most mature and perhaps his best movie\". The message of the film, writes critic Quentin Falk, is \"joyously life-affirming\", which he notes is common to much of Parker's work. He adds that Parker's films manage to achieve a blend of \"strong story and elegant frame\", a style which he says typically eludes other directors who rely too much on the purely visual.With Mississippi Burning (1988), Parker received his second Oscar nomination for Best Director. The film is based on a true story about the murders of three civil rights workers in 1964, and stars Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Hackman was nominated for Best Actor, while the film was nominated for five other Oscars, including Best Picture. It won for Best Cinematography.\n\n\n=== 1991\u20132003: Later works ===\nIn 1991 Parker directed The Commitments, a comedy about working class Dubliners who form a soul band. The film was an international success and led to a successful sound track album. To find a cast Parker visited most of the estimated 1,200 different bands then playing throughout Dublin. He met with over 3,000 different band members. Rather than pick known actors, Parker says he chose young musicians, most of whom had no acting experience, in order to remain \"truthful to the story\". \"I cast everybody to be very close to the character that they play in the film. They're not really playing outside of who they are as people.\" Parker says he wanted to make the film because he could relate to the hardships in the lives of young Dubliners, having come from a similar working-class background in north London.The film critic David Thomson observes that with The Commitments, Parker \"showed an unusual fondness for people, place, and music. It was as close as Parker has come to optimism.\" Parker said that it was the \"most enjoyable film\" he ever made.Evita (1996), was another musical, starring Madonna, Antonio Banderas and Jonathan Pryce. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's score originated from the earlier musical. Parker remembers Madonna's strong desire to play the role of Evita, that \"as far as she was concerned, no one could play Evita as well as she could, and she said that she would sing, dance and act her heart out, ... and that's exactly what she did\". Evita was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning for Best Original Song, which was sung by Madonna.Parker's next film was Angela's Ashes (1999), a drama based on the real-life experiences of the Irish-American teacher, Frank McCourt, and his childhood. His family was forced to move from the United States back to Ireland because of financial difficulties, which led to the family's problems caused by his father's alcoholism.Colm Meaney, who acted in The Commitments, noticed the dramatic shift in theme and style of Parker's films. He said \"it's the variety of his work that sort of staggers me. He can go from Evita to Angela's Ashes. He adds that \"when Alan starts a project, it's going to be something very interesting and completely out of left field\". Parker explained that doing a story like Angela's Ashes was simply his \"reaction against a big film\" like Evita. He said that he tried to avoid the \"obvious movies\", saying \"You want the film to stay with people afterwards ... It just seems to me that the greatest crime is to make just another movie.\" Parker said it is important to carefully choose which films to write and direct:\n\nMy mentor was the great director, Fred Zinnemann, whom I used to show all my films to until he died. He said something to me that I always try to keep in my head every time I decide on what film to do next. He told me that making a film was a great privilege, and you should never waste it.\nTherefore, when Parker visited film schools and spoke to young filmmakers, he told them that the new film technology available for making films and telling a story is less important than conveying a message: \"If you haven't got something to say, I don't think you should be a filmmaker\".The British film critic Geoff Andrew described Parker as a \"natural storyteller\" who got his message across using \"dramatic lighting, vivid characterisation, scenes of violent conflict regularly interrupting sequences of expository dialogue, and an abiding sympathy for the underdog (he is a born liberal with a keen sense of injustice)\".Parker produced and directed The Life of David Gale (2003), a crime thriller, starring Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet. It tells the story of an advocate for the abolition of capital punishment who finds himself on death row after having been convicted of murdering a fellow activist. The film received generally poor reviews.

    "Estoire d'Eracles": "The Estoire d'Eracles (\"History of Heraclius\") is an anonymous Old French translation and continuation of the Latin History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea by William of Tyre. It begins with recapture of Jerusalem by the Roman emperor Heraclius in AD 630, from which it takes its name, and continues down to 1184. The continuation recounts the history of the Crusader states from Saladin's capture of Jerusalem in 1187 down to 1277.The translation was made between 1205 and 1234, possibly in Western Europe. Several times the text of the translation was changed and the manuscripts preserve different versions of William's text. The continuations were added to the translation between 1220 and 1277. There are two different versions of the first continuation, covering the years 1185\u20131225. Both reflect the political attitudes of the Crusader aristocracy. There are 49 surviving manuscripts of the Eracles. Of these, 44 contain a first continuation drawn from the Chronicle of Ernoul and five (the so-called Colbert\u2013Fontainebleau manuscripts) contain a different version. Twelve of the manuscripts contain a unique continuation for the years 1229\u20131261 drawn from the independent work known as the Rothelin Continuation.The continuations of the Eracles have varying historical value. The translation itself, insofar as it differs from the original, is of no historical value as an independent source. The Ernoul continuation is an invaluable source for the period from 1187 until 1204, including the fall of Jerusalem, the reign of Conrad of Montferrat, the establishment of the Kingdom of Cyprus, the Third Crusade and the Byzantine Empire down to the Fourth Crusade.Although the Eracles has been published twice from different manuscripts versions, there has been no critical edition based on all the manuscripts.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",
    "TI Invaders": "TI Invaders is a fixed shooter video game published in 1981 for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A home computer. The game is a Space Invaders clone where the goal is to shoot of all aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen. TI Invaders was part of the TI Arcade Game Series, which also included Tombstone City: 21st Century and the Head On clone Car Wars.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nTI Invaders is a single-player fixed shooter. At the start of the game, the player is face with an enemy fleet eleven creatures wide and five creatures deep. With the joystick or keyboard, the player moves a laser base (called a missile in the manual) left and right, pressing the fire button to shoot lasers at an 11\u00d75 grid of invaders. Shooting different invaders scores different amounts (see below). As the number of invaders dwindles, they increasingly move faster. Upon shooting the last invader, the player moves on to a bonus round before the next level. As in Space Invaders, a UFO will appear once or twice a round and travel from one end of the screen to the other. The player has the opportunity to hit it to score bonus points, the amount depending on where the UFO is hit.\n\n\n=== Scoring ===\nThere are two difficulty levels to choose from:\nMerely Aggressive (the invaders fire semi-randomly, targeting the player only sporadically)\nDownright Nasty (the invaders fire rapidly and deliberately at the player, but their point values are doubled)\nScoring is as follows:\n\nLower and Lower-Middle Row - 5 or 10 points\nMiddle and Top-Middle Row - 10 or 20 points\nTop Row - 15 or 30 points\nAny new invaders - additional 5 or 10 points added\nLaser shot interception - 1 point\nUFO during a round - 25-300 points (depending on where it is hit)\nUFO during bonus round - 30, 33, 36, 38, 42, 45, 50, 56, 63, 71, 83, 100, 125, 167, 250, and 500 points (for a total of up to 1689 points in all.)\n\n\n=== Bonus round ===\nAfter each level is cleared, there is a bonus round consisting only of one UFO. The UFO will travel slowly from one end of the screen to the other until it is hit for the first time, then it returns other way at twice its original speed. The player must track it to the other side of the screen and shoot it again, making the UFO return in the other direction again. The UFO's score value increases gradually with each hit, and the UFO gets smaller and smaller. This continues until either the player eliminates the UFO completely, or it escapes off the screen. Then the next level commences.\n\n\n=== Bonus missiles ===\nAfter earning 3,000 points the player receives an additional missile. Thereafter, at every multiple of 10,000 points, one damaged missile is repaired and again usable. (When a missile is damaged, it rolls off onto a small elevator and off to the right of the screen, and one of the extra missiles rolls onto the elevator from the left hand side and takes its place. When one is repaired, it moves from the damaged end to the extras end fully repaired.)\n\n\n=== End of game ===\nWhen the last missile is destroyed, the closest invader to the bottom then goes down, clears away the area the extra missiles and damaged missiles were, writing \"GAME OVER\" in the middle of it all, then it and the rest of the remaining invaders on the screen jump up and down, as if laughing or cheering.  If both the last invader on the screen and the last missile are killed at the same time (which is not an uncommon occurrence at any time in the game), the next set of invaders will immediately appear on the screen, with again the invader closest to the bottom doing the game over routine.\nAlso, as in Space Invaders, if any number of invaders hits the bottom row, the closest one to the missile will shoot it from the side and the game is over regardless of the number of reserve missiles left.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nLawrence De Rusha, Jr. for InfoWorld said \"I found this game very entertaining and a challenge to play. Because the options, including the various screens, allow for a wide range of skills and because the level comes harder as you progress, the game has lasting value.\"Dick Olney for Personal Computer World said \"I long ago tired of this game in the arcades, but having such a good version in my living room did rekindle my interest. If you haven't already spent your quota in ten pences then you'll probably find this module good value for money.\"Unofficial 99/4(A) gave the game two stars and said \"All I can say is that the aliens keep coming, you shoot them down, they shoot at you, and a space craft flies by. All good fun if you are into that kind of game. Yawn ...\"It was the top-selling computer game for the TI-99/4A through at least 1982.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nReview in MC Microcomputer (Italian)\nReview in Videogiocchi (Italian)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGame manual\nTI Invaders (videogamehouse.net)\nTI Invaders gameplay",

    "2009 Schalfkogel avalanche": "The 2009 Schalfkogel avalanche was an avalanche which occurred in S\u00f6lden, Austria, on 2 May 2009. Six people were killed, five Czechs and one Slovak, when the disaster struck in the 3,500-metre (11,500 ft) Schalfkogel mountain range. The corpses were discovered to have been frozen upon recovery. It was the deadliest avalanche to have occurred in Austria since March 2000. Although avalanches are a regular occurrence in the region, they mainly kill individuals as opposed to entire groups.\n\n\n== Incident ==\nThe victims were hiking when they were buried under two and half metres of snow which fell on them. The avalanche occurred on 2 May at the S\u00f6lden ski resort. The hikers were approximately 1,600 feet (490 m) below the summit. Authorities said the six bodies were retrieved as they ascended Schalfkogel between the ski resorts of S\u00f6lden and Obergurgl near the Italian border. A rescue effort had gotten underway on 2 May but was suspended that night. The search had earlier been called off. Rescuers were hampered by severe weather conditions. Witnesses had seen the avalanche and reported it by 16:15 but rescuers were delayed by the snowstorm. As soon as the rescue helicopter was able to land all of the victims had been located within the hour. It is understood four of them quickly died and froze after being buried under the snow, whilst the other two had some oxygen and survived in an unfrozen state until this became impossible. Rescuers said these two might have been rescued.\n\n\n== Survivor ==\nOne forty-five-year-old man survived. He was a friend of the victims. He had stayed behind in a mountain hut whilst the others continued on their journey. The bodies were identified by this survivor.\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nThe mayor of S\u00f6lden, Ernst Sch\u00f6pf, said: \"It [was] clear that conditions were not right for a high-altitude tour on Saturday.\"\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Scenedesmus": "Scenedesmus is a genus of green algae, in the class Chlorophyceae. They are colonial and non-motile.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nCurrently, there are 74 taxonomically accepted species of Scenedesmus. Additionally, several subgenera have been identified, but vary according to the source. Hegewald denotes Acutodesmus, Desmodesmus, and Scenedesmus as the three major categories. Acutodesmus is characterized as having acute cell poles, while Desmodesmus and Scenedesmus have obtuse/truncated cell poles (differentiated by the presence or absence of spines respectively). Fossil records date Scenedesmus from 70 to 100 million years ago with Desmodesmus suspected to be the youngest of these three groups.\n\n\n== Basic biology ==\nScenedesmus is one of the most common freshwater algae genera; however, the extremely diverse morphologies found within species make identification difficult. While most species are found across the world, certain species exist only in local populations such as S. intermedius and S. serratus which are found in New Zealand.\n\n\n=== Coenobia and cell growth ===\nScenedesmus can exist as unicells; they are also frequently found in coenobia of four or eight cells inside a parental mother wall. Various coenobial architectures have been described, including linear, costulatoid, irregular, alternating, or dactylococcoid patterns (Figure 1). The formation of coenobia is dependent on a number of factors. A higher proportion of unicellular organisms was found at high light intensities and high temperatures, suggesting that at higher growth rates the organisms prefer to be non-colonized. \nSuccessful growth and division for algae relies on a balance between maintaining buoyancy in the euphotic zone (containing ideal light and nutritional conditions) and avoidance of grazing predators. Larger colonies have a smaller surface-to-volume ratio, which limits nutrient uptake and light harvesting, and the large mass promotes sinking. However, in the presence of grazers, such as Daphnia, that threaten to consume unicellular algae, the larger colonies provide significant security. This threat can be so significant that the cells will coalesce into these 8-cell colonies even in severely limiting growth conditions in order to reduce grazing vulnerability or while in nutrient-deplete conditions.\n\n\n=== Defense mechanisms ===\nThe cells have other mechanisms of self-defense in addition to colonizing. Scenedesmus can be divided into two subgenera, the non-spiny Scenedesmus and the spiny Desmodesmus. Although spineless, the Scenedesmus subgenera cells have thick cells walls and mucilage, which may make them digestion-resistant. Some chemical compounds in Scenedesmus could even be toxic to certain organisms upon consumption. Bristles of up to 100 um may form a net in both spiny and non-spiny varieties to discourage predation even further. Cells defensively form these bristles when kairomones are detected, an infochemical released by Daphnia that Scenedesmus has evolved to recognize as a warning signal.\n\n\n=== Reproduction and colony formation ===\nDuring replication, the mother cell enlarges and becomes multinucleate after multiple divisions. The cytoplasm then is cleaved into uninucleate daughter cells, usually developing as non-motile autospores. These daughter cells typically link up with other daughter cells to form a colony within the parental cell wall to be later released. The cells progress through a typical mitotic cycle similar to other members of Chlorophyceae, with the cytoplasm of the daughter cells becoming very dense. Eventually the mother cell wall breaks and releases the spores which adopt a normal cellular appearance. The cells at either end of the coenobium are different in morphology from those in the center. How the cells adhere to one another during development is still unclear, but it is known that a trilaminar sheath (TLS), composed of algaenan, is one of the first exterior structures to form, developing in patches before growing to connect into one continuous layer. The ornamented layer is the last component to develop.\n\n\n== Cell ornamentation and outer layers ==\nThe exterior ornamentation is highly variable within the genus Scenedesmus.  Staehelin et al. characterized two species in detail: S. pannonicus and S. longus. S. pannonicus assembles a tight-fitting \"warty\" layer compared to the loose \"reticulate\" layer found on S. longus. A shared feature between the two is a TLS found at the junction between neighboring cells that helps cement them together. An additional pectic layer observed on S. pannonicus forms a thick mesh of thin filaments originating from the warty layer. Another feature of the outer coenobial surface of S. pannonicus is a combination of individual spikes (seemingly connected to the warts) and small spikelets that fuse to form combs that zigzag along the cell. An overview of these structures can be seen in Figure 2. The last major category of ornamentation is rosettes that are common to many Scenedesmus species. Rosettes are ring-shaped structures enclosing small mounds on the cell surface and are usually sitting upon a thicker layer of cell wall than the surrounding areas. No potential function for these structures has been suggested. While S. longus was not observed with the comb-like structures of S. pannonicus, it did have two variations of spikelets forming between the TLS and reticulate layer to keep the two apart.\n\n\n== Mitochondrial DNA ==\nScenedesmus obliquus is notable for the non-standard coding of its mitochondrial DNA which may represent an intermediate form in the evolution of green algal mitochondrial DNA.  This code is represented by NCBI translation table 22, Scenedesmus obliquus mitochondrial code.\n\n\n== Biofuel production ==\nAlthough Scenedesmus is capable of producing many kinds of biofuels such as bio-hydrogen, biodiesel, bioethanol and drop-in fuels, most extensive research has been done on the use of Scenedesmus for bio-diesel production. Like all algae systems, the implementation of integrated biofuel production of Scenedesmus from the laboratory findings has challenges in large-scale production. Major challenges include nutrient supply and recycling, gas transfer and exchange, PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) delivery, cultural integrity, environmental control, land and water availability, harvesting, and genetic and metabolic engineering\n\n\n=== Bio-hydrogen (H2) production ===\n\nIn 1942, Gaffron and Rubin may be credited with conducting an experiment that sparked H2 production research in green algae using Scenedesmus obliquus. Algae produce H2 gas under anaerobic conditions by providing hydrogenases with hydrogen ions derived from splitting of water molecules via photosynthesis. However, enzyme activity is transient due to inhibition from O2 production via photosynthesis,  a problem that continues to plague H2 production.S. obliquus is traditionally known to utilize a nickel-iron hydrogenase, but usage of other iron hydrogenases in H2 production is also reported. Hydrogenase enzyme activity in Scenedesmus species is reported to be lower than that of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. H2 production independent of Photosystem II in Scenedesmus has also been performed using redox equivalents of fermentative metabolism under dark anaerobic incubation. Research findings suggest that a sulfur-deprived environment triggers an imbalance in the photosynthesis and respiration relationship, resulting in net consumption of O2, causing anaerobiosis, and switching to hydrogen production. Ultrasonication pretreatment has been effective in increasing fermentative bioenergy production from Scenedesmus oliquus YSW15. Bio-hydrogen production research using Scenedesmus is actively spurred by its applications to wastewater treatment. (See subsequent section on waste management by Scenedesmus).\n\n\n=== Bio-diesel production ===\n\nScenedesmus is known to have high biomass productivity among green algae, and has been actively researched for its use for bio-diesel production. Its heterotrophic production of biomass and lipid in optimized conditions is reported to have higher efficiency than its autotrophic production. Optimization of biomass productivity as well as lipid content through varying concentration of supplemental nutrients has been done in numerous studies; currently, Scenedesmus lipid yield after optimization has reached ~60% dry cell weight, lower than some other algae. However, Scenedesmus is more efficient at capturing CO2 than other algae. Like many algae species, Scenedesmus required nitrate-deficient condition to profoundly increase its lipid yield. A significant improvement (up to six-fold) of feedstock yields was achieved by adding varying concentrations of ethanol under a 12-hr photoperiod and in the dark. The most significant improvement in lipid production was obtained when stationary phase cultures were transferred to media deficient in nitrate for 7 days and phosphate for 3 days, respectively. Extraction of oils with methanol or ethanol from the Scenedesmus remains a challenge and its lower lipid content adds to the cost of production. \nIn a recent study, Scenedesmus abundans was isolated from Dal Lake, Kashmir and proved to be a suitable raw material for biodiesel production. The alga increased significantly in biomass and lipid content with the nitrogen concentration of 0.32g/L of nitrogen. A two-step transesterification was found to be best suited for transesterification, while Folch extraction was best for lipid extraction.\n\n\n=== Bio-ethanol ===\n\nScenedesmus, and other microalgae such as Chlorella, Dunaliella, Chlamydomonas, and Spirulina, contain large amounts of carbohydrate (>50% of the dry weight), which make them attractive candidates for bio-ethanol production. In one study, Scenedesmus was used to yield high biomass productivity; its carbohydrate-rich biomass was then hydrolyzed with 2% sulfuric acid and underwent an SHF (Separate Hydrolysis and Fermentation) process to produce 8.55 g L\u22121 of ethanol and a maximum yield of 0.213 g ethanol / g biomass within 4 hours of ethanol fermentation.\n\n\n=== Drop-in fuels ===\nIsoprenoids are considered important metabolites that can be utilized as drop-in fuels, often as alkane chains. Scenedesmus conducts a pyruvate/glyeraldehyde 3-phosphate non-mevalonate pathway to synthesize isoprenoids. However, isoprenoid yields were too low (1.5~15 mg per 10 liter of Scenedesmus culture when cells reached 0.5-0.6 g L\u22121) to be considered viable for future drop-in fuel production.\n\n\n== Wastewater management ==\nIn a study comparing the efficiency of ammonia and phosphorus removal from an agroindustrial wastewater by Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus dimorphus, Scenedesmus exhibited better efficiency of removing ammonia in cylindrical bioreactor while both algae removed phosphorus from the wastewater to the same extent. Algal Turf Scrubber (ATS) is one of many technologies that utilize algae for treating variety of wastes and industrially polluted waters. An algal turf scrubber in Florida, for example, removed phosphorus at a cost of $24 per kg whereas engineered wetland processes removed phosphorus at a cost of $77 per kg. While removing metallic wastes as well as organic substrates, growing Scenedesmus biomass could be utilized for producing cattle feeds, organic fertilizers, paper, construction paper, and biodiesel.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Ontario, Iowa": "Ontario is a community within the corporate limits of the city of Ames,  in  Story County, Iowa, United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first settlement in the area was New Philadelphia laid out in 1855 on the western edge of Story County just northwest of Iowa State College (now Iowa State University). The Chicago and North Western Railway was built just north of the town and the new railroad town complete with a rail station was established in January 1969. (1869?). It wasn't long before Ontario, strategically situated by the rail line, swallowed up New Philadelphia. A post office was established New Philadelphia in 1858, and renamed Ontario in 1868; the post office closed in 1951. The community was named after Ontario, Ohio, the native hometown of a first settler, Hiram Scott.

    "List of waterfalls of North Georgia": "The waterfalls of northern Georgia, U.S., are a prominent feature of the geography of that region, as well as a major focus of tourism and outdoor recreation. Many are located in state parks, national forests, wildlife management areas, and other public lands. Many are accessible\u2014with varying degrees of ease or difficulty\u2014via established hiking trails, and some developed areas include boardwalks, observation platforms, picnic areas, and other amenities. The Cherokee called this region \"Land of a Thousand Waterfalls\". The third-, fourth-, and fifth-highest waterfalls in the eastern United States are located in northern Georgia.\nIn this discussion, North Georgia refers to the mountainous regions of the extreme northern portion of the state, an area including Banks, Dade, Dawson, Fannin, Gilmer, Habersham, Lumpkin, Murray, Pickens, Rabun, Stephens, Towns, Union, Walker, and White Counties. There are, of course, waterfalls in other sections of the state; however, due to variations in both climate and terrain they are most abundant and most dramatic in the extreme north.\n\n\n== Falls by county ==\n\nWaterfalls that are located on private property and thus inaccessible to the public are described as such or are marked (NA). It is the visitor's responsibility to respect and honor the rights of private landholders.\nThose maps, coordinates, and descriptions presented here are meant only to provide approximate or relative locations. Numerous publications and online resources are available to those wishing to visit these sites, both by foot and by vehicle. As many of these sites remain in a relatively wild state caution must be exercised at all times.\n\n\n=== Dade County ===\nCherokee Falls & Hemlock Falls\u2014located in Cloudland Canyon State Park near Trenton, in a deep gorge on Sitton Gulch Creek.

It is approximately four times the height of Niagara's Horseshoe Falls. It is located on Amicalola Creek in Amicalola Falls State Park and is accessible via several trails, bridges, and parking areas. Visitors may park at either the top or the base of the falls; a well-maintained trail, including over 600 steps, connects those two points. Another trail connects the falls to the terminus of the Appalachian Trail on nearby Springer Mountain. Some sources, including the 2004 Georgia State Parks guide book, claim that Amicaolola Falls are \"the tallest east of the Mississippi River,\" although Crabtree Falls in Virginia (at 1000 feet) and Glassmine Falls in North Carolina (800 feet) are both taller. (The state park website is more specific\u2014and perhaps more accurate\u2014citing Amicalola as \"the tallest cascading waterfall\". More recent editions of the print version of the guide have corrected the error.)

    "Hybridisation in shorebirds": "Hybridisation in shorebirds has been proven on only a small number of occasions; however, many individual shorebirds have been recorded by birdwatchers worldwide that do not fit the characters of known species. Many of these have been suspected of being hybrids. In several cases, shorebird hybrids have been described as new species before their hybrid origin was discovered. Compared to other groups of birds (such as gulls), only a few species of shorebirds are known or suspected to hybridize, but nonetheless, these hybrids occur quite frequently in some cases.\n\n\n== Hybrids in the Scolopaci (typical waders) ==\n\n\n=== \"Cooper's\" and \"Cox's\" sandpipers ===\n\nAn apparently new sandpiper species (\"Cooper's sandpiper Tringa/Calidris cooperi\") was described in 1858 based on a specimen collected in 1833 on Long Island, New York. A similar bird was collected in 1981 at Stockton, New South Wales, Australia. These are probably hybrids between the curlew sandpiper (\"Calidris\" ferruginea) and the sharp-tailed sandpiper (Philomachus acuminatus/Calidris acuminata).Cox's sandpiper (\"Calidris\" \u00d7 paramelanotos), described as a new species in 1982, is now known to be a stereotyped hybrid between males of the pectoral sandpiper (\"Calidris\" melanotos) and female curlew sandpipers. It is known from nearly two dozen sightings since the 1950s, almost all of which are from Australia, with one record from Massachusetts. and another from Japan.\n\n\n=== Other hybrid scolopacids ===\nA stint at Groote Keeten in the Netherlands which was initially thought to be that country's first record of the least sandpiper but which showed anomalous features, was postulated to be a hybrid between little stint (\"Calidris\" minuta) and Temminck's stint (\"Calidris\" temminckii).Putative hybrids between the dunlin (\"Calidris\" alpina) and the white-rumped sandpiper (\"Calidris\" fuscicollis) have been occasionally seen in northeastern North America. In Europe, on the other hand, an apparent hybrid between the dunlin and the purple sandpiper (\"Calidris\" maritima) has turned up.Courtship and copulation have also been observed between common (Actitis hypoleucos) and spotted sandpipers (Actitis macularia), but there are no records of hybrid offspring.Occurrence of intrageneric hybridization has been reported between the buff-breasted sandpiper (\"Tryngites\" subruficollis) and the white-rumped (or possibly Baird's, \"Calidris\" bairdii) sandpiper \u2013 the parent species apparently do belong into the same genus, however (see calidrid) -, as well as between the common and the green sandpiper (Tringa ochropus).\n\n\n== Hybridisation in the Charadrii (oystercatchers, stilts, avocets and plovers) ==\nHybridisation between American (Haematopus palliatus frazari) and black oystercatchers (Haematopus bachmani) is relatively common in southern California and adjacent Mexico.The \"avistilt\" or \"stavocet\" is a hybrid between black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) and American avocet (Recurvirostra americana), occasionally found in California. One such bird was accidentally bred in the San Francisco Zoo in 1971 and lived at least until 1974. The avocet was the father and the stilt the mother of this individual, which apparently was a male.The nearly extinct New Zealand black stilt (Himantopus novaezelandiae) hybridizes  with the pied stilt (Himantopus leucocephalus), which jeopardizes the survival of the former species.A Pluvialis plover wintering with a flock of golden plover near Marksbury, England, in 1987 was believed to be possibly a hybrid between golden plover and Pacific golden plover.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBird hybrid\nHybridisation in gulls which also belong in the order Charadriiformes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Austin Champ": "The Austin Champ was a military and civilian jeep-like vehicle made by the Austin Motor Company in the 1950s. The army version was officially known as \"Truck, 1/4 ton, CT, 4\u00d74, Cargo & FFW, Austin Mk.1\" however the civilian name \"Champ\" was universally, if unofficially, applied to it.\nThe majority of Champs produced went to the British Army.\n\n\n== History ==\nA British Army specification for a light truck was issued in the late 1940s, inspired by the Willys MB \"Jeep\" but able to perform in all theatres of operation of the British Army. It was considered important that a British-made vehicle was produced in order to reduce the reliance on American vehicles and the foreign expenditure that entailed.\nA project to design a \"Car 4\u00d74 5 cwt FV1800-Series\" was launched in 1947, and the Nuffield Organization built three prototype designs known as the \"Nuffield Gutty\". Testing revealed serious shortcomings and the design was improved by a team at the government Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (FVRDE) under the leadership of Charles William \"Rex\" Sewell. The suspension system was designed by Alec Issigonis, who went on to design the Morris Minor and the Mini.\nAbout 30 prototypes of the improved vehicle were built by Wolseley Motors Limited under the name \"Wolseley Mudlark\", and after further refinement the design was formalised as FV1801(a). The Austin Motor Company was awarded the contract to produce 15,000 vehicles and a former aircraft factory at Cofton Hackett, on the edge of Austin's Longbridge plant in Birmingham, was fitted out for the work. The first production vehicle was completed on 1 September 1951. The formal title: \"Truck, 1/4 Ton, 4\u00d74, CT, Austin Mk.1\" was assigned (CT being a contraction of CombaT, both a designation of function and also the title of a planned family of vehicles designed by FVRDE). The Rolls-Royce-designed B40 four-cylinder engine of 2838 cc was fitted, the smallest of the standardised B-Range engines. This military version was designated model WN1 by Austin.  Approximately half of the contract were to be basic vehicles known as Cargo trucks and the remainder were to be fitted with high-output generators and additional batteries in order to power radio equipment. These were known as \"Fitted For Wireless\" (FFW) vehicles. Rolls-Royce Ltd built engines for the early production vehicles, but later ones were fitted with a virtually identical engine built under licence by Austin itself.\nIn order to obtain some commercial benefit from the contract, Austin was given permission to use the design for a simplified civilian version to be sold as the Austin Champ. This version, designated model WN3, was mostly fitted with a modified Austin A90 Atlantic 4-cylinder engine as a cheaper option than the more complex B40 but the vehicle attracted few customers and only about 500 were built, the great majority of these being exported.\nIn military service, the vehicles were given the official designation FV1801A and were generally referred to as \"Trucks, 1/4 ton, Austin\". A few were fitted with additional equipment for use as field ambulances, telephone line-laying vehicles or equipped with armour and a .303 in Vickers medium machine gun or .303 Bren light machine gun utilising the built-in pintle mount forward of the windscreen, but the majority served as cargo/personnel carriers or were fitted with radios. A version armed with a single, dashboard-mounted .30 in Browning machine gun was in limited use as late as 1967.\nAs the Champ entered service it became apparent that although it had an outstanding cross-country performance, it was too expensive (\u00a31200 at 1951 prices), too complex and had limited use outside of the narrow field combat role for which it had been designed. Consequently, the contract with Austin was amended and finally prematurely terminated some 4,000 vehicles short of the 15,000 originally contracted.\nThe Land Rover, which had entered army service before the Champ (as early as 1949), was half the price, simpler to maintain and could do 80% of the tasks the Champ could do. Ultimately it replaced the Champ in all roles. The Champ served with the British Army in the UK, Africa, Germany, Cyprus, Libya and the Suez Campaign, and early vehicles were sent for troop trials at the end of the Korean War.The Champ cost far more than the Land Rover, and was never as popular with troops, probably because the Land Rover with its enclosed cab offered better protection from the elements and greater flexibility in use. With the reduction in size of the post-war army, many Champs were consigned to bulk vehicle storage and those employed in the Regular Army had relatively short careers before being redeployed to the Territorial Army. In the mid-1960s a decision was taken to withdraw the type from service completely, with all military Champs being sold off by 1968 although there is a record of one being sold by government auction as late as 1973. These mass sales made them cheap to buy (\u00a3150 being typical in 1966) and with fuel at low 1960s prices, many were bought as \"fun\" vehicles and used with little regard to the routine maintenance that the complex design required.\nThe only other forces to use the Champ were the Royal Marines who had 30 and the Australian Army who bought 400 new and about the same number of ex-British Army ones. One or two examples were also used by a mercenary unit in the Congo in the mid 1960s.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe engine was a four-cylinder in-line petrol unit of 2838 cc capacity (3.5-inch-diameter (89 mm) pistons \u00d7 4.5-inch (110 mm) stroke) designed by Rolls Royce and was the smallest of the standardised B-Range military engines. These engines had their origin in a 1936 design produced at Derby, with the concept and dimensions first developed for the Rolls-Royce 20 HP of 1922, but with the demands of the war, development was not proceeded with until the late 1940s. The engine was designed with absolute reliability as a prime criterion with fuel economy a secondary consideration, and using British Standard Fine (BSF) thread standards. A feature of this engine was the use of a cast aluminium cylinder head with screwed-in hardened steel valve seats.\nWith the adoption in 1949 of Unified thread standards, the engine was re-designed and simplified to ease manufacture; a cast-iron cylinder head was used in this version which can be most easily identified by the letters \"UNF\" cast or pressed into the rocker cover.\nRolls-Royce produced engines at Crewe early in the contract but did not have the capacity for volume production at the rate required, therefore Austin was lent tooling and licensed to build a virtually identical engine, and Austin-made engines were fitted in the great majority of Champs built. Cylinder blocks for both manufacturers were supplied by Leyland Motors.\nThe gearbox had five ratios with synchromesh on all gears. A conventional Borg & Beck clutch with mechanical linkage was used and drive from the gearbox was by shaft to the rear combined transfer box and differential assembly which incorporated reverse gear, thereby allowing five reverse gears also, and then by a long shaft to the front differential which incorporated a simple dog clutch to enable four-wheel drive when required.  A conventional separate transfer case was not possible due to the cruciform layout of the vehicle chassis which placed the junction of the cruciform where the transfer box would reside on a conventional ladder-type chassis. Bendix \"Tracta\" type constant velocity joints were fitted at all wheel stations.  All transmission assemblies were sealed against the ingress of water.\nThe suspension system was based on longitudinal torsion bars for primary springing and featured fully independent suspension at all four wheels using double wishbones. Each wheel station was also fitted with a rubber cone and cup system to buffer extreme upward suspension travel with energy control exercised by double-acting telescopic hydraulic dampers. This system gave an exceptional cross-country performance. Front and rear axles were constructed into a cradle sub-assembly, which could be rapidly exchanged in the field.\nThe braking system was supplied by Girling and employed drums and a simple single-line hydraulic layout without power assistance.\nThe engine, fuel system and all electrical items were waterproofed so the vehicle could wade to a depth of 6 feet (2 m) with minimal preparation; a snorkel attached to the air cleaner and normally carried horizontally on the right wing (US = fender) could be raised during wading operations. Maintaining this level of capability was found to be expensive and of limited value, and the policy of CT vehicles was abandoned in 1956 and the CT family were downgraded to General Service (GS) status.\nElectrical equipment fitted on military Champs was a 24-volt system in accordance with agreements reached in 1948 with the US and Canadian armies and comprised standardised military pattern equipment used on many British post-war vehicles, supplied by Lucas, CAV, Delco-Remy and Simms. Instrumentation was a system common to many other military vehicles of the period and supplied by Smiths Instruments of London.\nThe body was a utilitarian open four-seater tub of welded pressed steel panels, supplied by the Pressed Steel Company, and similar in style to the war-time Jeep layout although unlike the Jeep, the Champ body is designed to carry part of the vehicle stresses and chassis flexing. A simple hood (top) made from PVC coated cloth (trade name Rexine) was provided and a set of weather screens with hinged doors on a simple frame were available for issue in intemperate climates.  The inner windscreen opened forwards for ventilation or the whole frame and glass assembly could be folded down onto the bonnet (hood). Military items such as a shovel, pickaxe and a carrier for a standard 20-litre jerrycan (for the carriage of water not fuel) were normally fitted. A 20-gallon (91 litre) fuel tank was located at the rear of the vehicle, giving an operational range of approximately 300 miles.\nVarious bolt-on kits were produced to convert basic vehicles for specialist roles, for example tactical radio carrier, telephone line laying, field ambulance with two stretchers, and an appliqu\u00e9 armour kit. Strangely, the armour components were listed in the Austin civilian parts catalogue but not in the army one. A standard radio fitting kit for 1/4-ton vehicles comprising a 50-inch table running on sliding runners, battery mountings and appropriate fittings was introduced in 1956. When this kit was fitted, the vehicle was re-designated as Fitted For Radio (FFR) to differentiate it from the basic FFW version.\nSome prototype vehicles with a Land Rover-style rear body with tailgate rear access were constructed in an attempt to improve the versatility of the basic design but were not put into production.\n\n\n== Civilian version ==\nChamps made for the civilian market (model WN3) could be specified with the Rolls Royce engine or, as was much more usual, a modified version of Austin's 2660 cc A90 engine. Military body fittings such as rifle clips were omitted and the windscreen was a fixed assembly. Commercial 12-volt electrical components by Lucas Industries were provided and facilities for power take-off, driven from the transfer box, were available.\nAround 500 of the civilian version are thought to have been made, including at least one left-hand-drive version. They were priced at \u00a3750 in November 1952, and at \u00a31000 in November 1954. Many went to Australia, where some can still be found. Two are known to have survived in the UK. Some of the design features of the Champ were carried over to the Austin Gipsy, of which some 21,000 were made from 1958 to 1967.\nThe civilian WN3 was adapted as a small fire engine by Fire Armour Ltd of London for use in commercial premises and for locations where large vehicle access was difficult. This version was known as the Firefly and carried a 60-gallon water tank, pump and ladders. One still exists today in preservation. Specialist chemical incident and a light rescue version were offered by the company.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\nEngine:\nFV1801 (Military): Rolls Royce B40, either built by RR (4 digit engine numbers) or by Austin  (5 digit engine numbers)\nChamp (civilian): Austin A90 engine or the B40\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n \n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Austin Champ at Wikimedia Commons\n\nAustin Memories\nAustin Champ Owners' Club",

    "Agnes Chow": "Agnes Chow Ting (Chinese: \u5468\u5ead, born 3 December 1996) is a Hong Kong politician and social activist. She is a former member of the Standing Committee of Demosist\u014d and former spokesperson of Scholarism. Her candidacy for the 2018 Hong Kong Island by-election, supported by the pro-democracy camp, was blocked by authorities, due to her party's advocacy of self-determination for Hong Kong.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nChow has described her upbringing as apolitical. Her social activism began around the age of 15, after being inspired by a Facebook post with thousands of young people agitating for change. According to Chow, her Catholic upbringing had an influence on her participation in the social movements.In 2014, Chow attended Hong Kong Baptist University, where she studied government and international relations. In 2018, Chow deferred her final year of university studies in order to run in the Hong Kong Island by-election. Chow also renounced her British nationality, which was a qualification requirement mandated by the Basic Law.Chow is fluent in Cantonese, Mandarin, English, and Japanese. She taught herself Japanese by watching anime. Chow has made appearances in Japanese media, interviews, and news programmes. Media outlets in Japan have referred to her as the \"Goddess of Democracy\" (\u6c11\u4e3b\u306e\u5973\u795e) for her role in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.In February 2020, Chow launched a YouTube channel, where she uploaded vlogging videos in Cantonese and Japanese. As of December 2020, Chow had over 300,000 subscribers.On 28 June 2021, local Hong Kong media reported that Chow\u2019s Facebook profile had been deleted. Chow didn\u2019t respond to reporter questions on whether she deleted her profile on her own.\n\n\n== Early activism ==\n\nChow first came to prominence in 2012 as the spokesperson of student activist group Scholarism. Then a student at Holy Family Canossian College, she protested against the implementation of the Moral and National Education scheme, which critics deemed \"brainwashing\". During a demonstration, she met fellow activists Joshua Wong and Ivan Lam. The movement successfully drew thousands of protesters gathered in front of the Central Government Complex, which led to the government backing down in September 2012.In 2014, Chow collaborated with student organizations to advocate electoral reform in Hong Kong. Chow was a leader of the class boycott campaign against the restrictive electoral framework set by the National People's Congress Standing Committee for the 2017 Chief Executive election, which led to the massive Occupy protests dubbed the \"Umbrella Revolution\". During the protests, citing heavy political pressure, Chow stepped away from politics, including resigning as spokesperson of Scholarism.\n\n\n== Demosist\u014d ==\n\nIn the wake of Occupy, a new generation of younger, more radical democrats gained prominence and were looking to move into participatory politics. In April 2016, Chow co-founded political party Demosist\u014d with Joshua Wong and Nathan Law, also student leaders in the Occupy protests. She was the first deputy secretary-general of the party, from 2016 to 2017. She campaigned with party chairman Law in the 2016 Legislative Council election, in which the latter was elected as the youngest-ever member of the Legislative Council. In 2017, she participated in the protest during the visit of Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping, in which they covered the Golden Bauhinia statue with banners. She was arrested along with Law and Demosist\u014d secretary-general Wong.On 30 June 2020, Chow, Law and Wong announced that they had disbanded Demosist\u014d, which they co-founded. The announcement came just hours before Beijing passed the national security law in Hong Kong, which raised concerns of political persecution of activists. She also said on Facebook that she is no longer conducting any international advocacy work.\n\n\n== Legislative Council bid ==\nAfter Law was ejected from the Legislative Council over the oath-taking controversy in July 2017 and sentenced to imprisonment in August of the same year, Chow became Demosist\u014d's candidate in the 2018 Hong Kong Island by-election. To qualify for the election, she gave up her British citizenship. On 27 January 2018, her candidacy was disqualified by the Electoral Affairs Commission on the basis of that she \"cannot possibly comply with the requirements of the relevant electoral laws, since advocating or promoting 'self-determination' is contrary to the content of the declaration that the law requires a candidate to make to uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.\"Michael Davis, a former law professor of the University of Hong Kong, warned that Chow's disqualification was wrong and the government was on a \"slippery slope\". Former university law dean Professor Johannes Chan Man-mun said there was no legal basis for such a move. Basic Law Committee member Albert Chen Hung-yee said election rules were not clear that returning officers had the power to disqualify candidates based on their political views. Chief Executive Carrie Lam asserted that \"any suggestion of Hong Kong independence, self-determination, independence as a choice or self-autonomy is not in line with Basic Law requirements and deviates from the important principle of 'one country two systems'.\" Had Chow been elected, she would have been Hong Kong's youngest-ever lawmaker, ahead of her colleague Nathan Law.After Chow's disqualification, Demosist\u014d endorsed pro-democracy candidate Au Nok-hin, who won the by-election. On 2 September 2019, Chow succeeded in her appeal after the judge ruled that \"she had insufficient opportunity to respond to the grounds for disqualification\". Since her ban was overturned by the Hong Kong Court, Au lost his Legislative Council seat as the court claimed he was not duly elected. After the ruling, Chow described the result as a \"Pyrrhic victory\".\n\n\n== Arrests and imprisonment ==\n\n\n=== 21 June Wan Chai case ===\nChow was arrested on 30 August 2019 at her Tai Po home for allegedly participating in, and inciting, an unauthorised assembly at Wan Chai Hong Kong Police Headquarters on 21 June 2019. On the same day, many high-profile Hong Kong pro-democracy figures were arrested, including Joshua Wong, Au Nok-hin, Andy Chan, and Jeremy Tam. She was freed the same day on bail, but her smartphone, like those of her fellow arrestees, was confiscated by police. Amnesty International called the arrests \"an outrageous assault\" on freedom of expression.Chow pleaded guilty to the charges on 6 July 2020, telling the media she was mentally prepared to be sentenced to imprisonment. She was formally convicted on 5 August 2020.Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam and Joshua Wong were put in custody until a trial scheduled on 2 December 2020, after a pre-trial hearing in the West Kowloon District court, that was having place on 23 November 2020, where they pleaded guilty regarding the events of a demonstration of June 2019 outside a Hong Kong police headquarters, where, that time of June 2019, thousands of protesters had demanded investigation of use of force by the police.She was remanded at Tai Lam Centre for Women in Tuen Mun until the trial.\n\nOn 2 December 2020, Agnes Chow was sentenced to 10 months in jail (Joshua Wong \u2014 13.5 months, Ivan Lam \u2014 7 months). A judge in the trial, West Kowloon Magistrate Wong Sze-lai, pronounced accusation: \"The defendants called on protesters to besiege the headquarters and chanted slogans that undermine the police force\". Amnesty International condemned the sentencing, saying that the Chinese authorities \"send a warning to anyone who dares to openly criticise the government that they could be next\".She was initially imprisoned at the medium-security Lo Wu Correctional Institution. On 31 December 2020, local media reported that Chow had been transferred to the maximum-security Tai Lam Centre for Women (where she was previously remanded), after she was classified as a Category A prisoner.On 12 June 2021, Chow was released from prison after serving her 6-months sentence. Some supporters gathered outside to welcome her dressed in black and with yellow masks, shouting slogans in Cantonese related to the protests.\n\n\n==== International responses to the imprisonment ====\n\n\n===== United States =====\nUS House of Representative Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a statement calling \"China\u2019s brutal sentencing of these young champions of democracy in Hong Kong\" as \"appalling\". Pelosi further called on the world to denounce \"this unjust sentencing and China\u2019s widespread assault on Hong Kongers.\u201d US Senator Marsha Blackburn also called the sentence destroying \"any semblance of autonomy in Hong Kong.\"\n\n\n===== United Kingdom =====\nUK Foreign Minister Dominic Raab issued a statement urging \"Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition\" in response to the prison sentences of the three pro-democracy activists.\n\n\n===== Japan =====\nJapan's government spokesperson Katsunobu Kato in a regular news conference expressed Japan's \"increasingly grave concerns about the recent Hong Kong situation such as sentences against three including Agnes Chow\".\n\n\n===== Taiwan =====\nThe Overseas Community Affairs Council (OCAC) issued a statement referencing to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) that \"the decision to imprison Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam represents a failure by the Hong Kong government to protect the people's political rights and freedom of speech\".\n\n\n===== Germany =====\nMaria Adebahr, a Germany\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, stated that the prison terms are \u201canother building block in a series of worrisome developments that we have seen in connection with human and civil rights in Hong Kong during the last year.\u201d\n\n\n=== National Security Law case ===\n\nFollowing the enactment of the national security law by the NPCSC, Chow was arrested again on 10 August 2020, reportedly on charges of violating the national security law. The detainment took place amid a mass arrest of various pro-democracy figures on the same day, including media mogul Jimmy Lai. Chow's arrest sparked a worldwide social media campaign calling for her release, which also prompted statements from Japanese politicians and celebrities. She was released on bail on 12 August 2020, where she said that her arrest was \"political persecution and political suppression\". She concluded that she still didn't understand why she had been arrested.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nChow was on the list of the BBC's 100 Women announced on 23 November 2020.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\nFrontline (2020).

    "Princess Royal (1786 EIC ship)": "Princess Royal, launched in 1786, was an East Indiaman. She made two complete trips to India for the British East India Company (EIC) and was on her third trip, this one to China, when French privateers or warships captured her on 27 September 1793. The French Navy took her into service in the Indian Ocean as a 34-gun frigate under the name Duguay Trouin. The Royal Navy recaptured her and she returned to British merchant service. In 1797 she performed one more voyage for the EIC. She received a letter of marque in July 1798 but was captured in October 1799 off the coast of Sumatra.\n\n\n== EIC ==\nCaptain James Horncastle commanded Princess Royal on all three of her voyages, including her last.\n\n\n=== EIC voyage #1 (1787-88) ===\nHorncastle left the Downs on 6 January 1787, bound for Madras, Bengal, and Bombay. Capt James Horncastle. Princess Royal reached the Cape on 3 April, and arrived at Madras on 6 June. From there she sailed to Calcutta, arriving at Diamond Harbour on 18 June. For her return trip, she passed Saugor on 16 November, and reached Bombay on 12 February 1788. She reached St Helena on 12 June and arrived at the Downs on 22 August. During this voyage Horncastle and Princess Royal reportedly fought an action in the Straits of Malacca, though it is not clear against whom.\n\n\n=== EIC voyage #2 (1790-91) ===\nHorncastle left the Downs on 26 April 1790, bound for Bombay. Princess Royal reached Johanna on 12 August and arrived at Bombay on 3 September.  From there she sailed to Tellicherry, which she reached on 7 October, Anjengo (27 October), and Tellicherry again (14 November), before returning to Bombay on 30 November. For her return trip she reached Tellicherry on 7 January 1791, the Cape on 3 March, and St Helena on 22 March. She arrived at the Downs on 13 May.\n\n\n=== EIC voyage #3 and capture (1793-capture) ===\nHorncastle left the Downs on 5 April 1793, bound for St Helena and China. The French Revolutionary Wars had begun two months earlier so Horncastle received a letter of marque dated 28 February 1793. This would permit him to engage in offensive action against the French should the opportunity present itself. Princess Royal reached St Helena on 11 July. Unfortunately, on 29 September three French warships captured her off Anger (or Anjere) Point while she was still on her way to China.H. Couperus, the Dutch governor of Malacca, wrote a letter on 15 December 1793 to the English captains there that a letter from Batavia dated 29 September reported that three French warships had attacked and captured Princess Royal. The letter further reported that the French ships mounted about 120 guns between them. Captain Bampton, of Hormazeer, arrived with a cargo of sugar from Batavia that he picked up after delivering a cargo to Botany Bay. He reported that he had seen three French ships at Batavia, two of 50 guns and one of 44 guns. Another report, this by Captain Simpson of Carron, stated that three French warships were cruising off the coast of Canton. He described them as a 64-gun, a 44-gun, and a 20-gun vessel; they had a large number of troops aboard and were believed responsible for Princess Royal's capture.A later account reports that the three privateers were the 36-gun Dumouriez, 32-gun La Libert\u00e9, and 28-gun \u00c9galit\u00e9. Horncastle fought for an hour before striking. Princess Royal had two men killed and three wounded.Her captors took Princess Royal to \u00cele de France. There she was sold; reportedly, \"Prize-taking has become so lucrative on Mauritius that bidding for the fast-sailing Princess Royal was fierce and she sold for 2,400,000 livres.\" Lloyd's List reported that she was in Mauritius being fitted out as a privateer. The French Navy requisitioned her and renamed her Duguay Trouin.\n\n\n== French naval service ==\n\nOn 25 January 1794, Duguay Trouin, under the command of Julien Th\u00e9rouart, was in the Sunda Strait as part of a French naval squadron from \u00cele de France, that also included the frigates Prudente and Cyb\u00e8le, and the brig Vulcain, all four vessels under the overall command of Captain Jean-Marie Renaud. There they engaged a squadron of EIC ships consisting of the East Indiamen William Pitt, Houghton, and Britannia, the country ship Nonsuch, the Bombay Marine (EIC) 14-gun brig Nautilus, and two recently captured French privateers, all under the overall command of Commodore Charles Mitchell. (The two privateers were the corvettes Vengeur and R\u00e9solue. On 17 January they had attacked the EIC factory at Bencoolen, where the East Indiaman Pigot had repelled them. Mitchell's squadron encountered the two on 22 January and captured them.)\nFor an hour the two squadrons continued a general exchange of fire at long-range, before Mitchell turned William Pitt, Houghton and Nonsuch towards the French at 09:30, the latter two both managing to hit Cyb\u00e8le with destructive broadsides. Firing continued for another 18 minutes as Renaud withdrew, eventually anchoring off the island of Pulau Baby. Neither commander was keen to continue the action, Mitchell fearing that his undermanned ships would not be able to properly engage the better armed French vessels. Casualties among the French squadron are not known, but the only loss on the British ships was on Nonsuch, which had a man killed in combat with Cyb\u00e8le.In need of reinforcement and resupply, Mitchell drew his squadron back to Batavia and was there joined by the 36 gun Dutch frigate Amazone under Captain Kerwal and an armed merchant ship. Mitchell's ships then cruised the Sunda Strait for another two weeks without discovering any enemy vessels, before concluding the operation on 8 February and returning to the Indian Ocean via Bencoolen.Renaud used Mitchell's retreat to withdraw also into the Indian Ocean via Bencoolen. His squadron reached the British trading post on 9 February, where Pigot was still undergoing repairs. The French vessels' arrival took Pigot by surprise and they captured her. As the merchant ship was manoeuvred out of the bay, Renaud demanded the surrender of the small Fort Marlborough nearby and was informed that the fort was well armed and that the arrival of Mitchell's squadron was expected at any moment. Unwilling to reengage with Mitchell, Renaud withdrew immediately without assaulting the fort. The French squadron subsequently returned to \u00cele de France.\n\n\n== Recapture ==\n\nHMS Orpheus, Captain Newcome, captured Duguay Trouin on 5 May 1794. In the action, Orpheus had a midshipman killed, and nine men wounded. French casualties amounted to 21 men killed and 60 wounded. Many of the French crew were ill and Newcome believed that they would not survive the voyage to Madras. Instead, he sailed to Mah\u00e9, Seychelles, where he arrived on 16 May. It was a French possession but it made no resistance when he arrived.\nNewcome landed 200 sick and wounded prisoners, as well as the rest of Dugay Trouin's crew on Ste. Anne Island, from where a brig later carried them to at Port-Louis, Mauritius. Newcome wrote to Malartic, the governor of Mauritius, asking him to release British prisoners equal in number and rank to those Newcome had landed.\nWhile it was in the Seychelles, the British squadron also captured the brig Olivette, which belonged to the French privateer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Hodoul, and Deux Andr\u00e9s, a slaver from Mozambique under the command of Captain Hardy, with 408 slaves on board. On 20 May Newcome sent Olivette to Praslin to gather supplies for the squadron,\nNewcome left Mah\u00e9 on 1 June and arrived at Madras on 18 June, together with Duguay Trouin and Deux Andr\u00e9s.\n\n\n== Merchantman and capture ==\nOn 2 August 1794, it was announced that friends of Captain Reid, of Madras, had purchased Duguay Trouin and appointed him her captain. Duguay Trouin sold for \u00a32900. Her purchasers renamed her Catherine and employed her in the coastal trade. John Reid had left Princess Royal by 4 May 1797. (He shipped on board the country ship Pearl for Bussora and may have died later that year.)She made one more voyage for the EIC. At some point Catherine reverted to the name Princess Royal. It is most likely that the name reversion occurred before she left for England.\nCaptain John Wedgborough (or Wedgebrough) left Bombay on 9 August 1797. Princess Royal reached the Cape on 16 October and St Helena on 3 December. She arrived at the Downs on 31 January 1798. Wedgebrough received a letter of marque on 14 July 1798.Lloyd's List reported in 1800 that a privateer had captured Princess Royal, \"late Company's ship\", in November 1799 off the coast of Sumatra. The captor was reported to be the privateer Malartic, of 12 guns. Malartic's captain was the noted French privateer Jean-Marie Dutertre. Le Moniteur Universel reported on 2 flor\u00e9al an VIII (22 April 1800) that two privateers had captured Princess Royal and 15 lesser vessels, with a note stating that the 120-man Malartic had alone captured Princess Royal.\n\n\n== Notes, citations and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== References ===\nBiden, Christopher (1830).

    "Kj\u00f8llefjord Church": "Kj\u00f8llefjord Church (Norwegian: Kj\u00f8llefjord kirke) is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Lebesby Municipality in Troms og Finnmark county, Norway. It is located in the village of Kj\u00f8llefjord. It is one of the churches in the Lebesby parish which is part of the Hammerfest prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H\u00e5logaland. The white, stone church was built in a long church style in 1951 using plans drawn up by the architect Finn Bryn (1890-1975). The church seats about 300 people.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first church in Kj\u00f8llefjord was built around the year 1670 after the medieval Skj\u00f8tningberg Church was closed. In 1738, the small, timber church was torn down and replaced with a new, larger church on the same site. The church was originally a cruciform design, but it was later converted to a long church design.In 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke). Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called \"electors\" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.On 4 November 1944, the old church was burned to the ground by the retreating German army near the end of the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. This was the first church rebuilt after the war. The funding for the church was from the Kingdom of Denmark which gave it as a gift to help with the rebuilding after World War II.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of churches in Nord-H\u00e5logaland\nLiberation of Finnmark\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Lyle Mays (album)": "Lyle David Mays (November 27, 1953 \u2013 February 10, 2020) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and member of the Pat Metheny Group. Metheny and Mays composed and arranged nearly all of the group's music, for which Mays won eleven Grammy Awards.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nWhile growing up in rural Wisconsin, Mays had a lot of curiosity but had to learn many things all by himself due to a lack of available resources and information. He had four main interests: chess, mathematics, architecture, and music. His mother Doris played piano and organ, and his father Cecil, a truck driver, taught himself to play guitar by ear.  His teacher allowed him to practice improvisation after the structured elements of the lesson were completed. At the age of nine, he played the organ at a family member's wedding, and fourteen he began to play in church. In summer national stage band camp in Normal, Illinois, he was introduced to jazz pianist Marian McPartland in his senior year of high school.Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival and Filles de Kilimanjaro by Miles Davis (both recorded in 1968) were important influences. He attended the University of North Texas after transferring from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire. He composed and arranged for the One O'Clock Lab Band and was the composer and arranger for the Grammy Award-nominated album Lab 75.After leaving the University of North Texas, Mays toured in the US and Europe with Woody Herman's jazz big band, Thundering Herds, for approximately eight months. In 1975 he met Pat Metheny at the Wichita Jazz Festival and later founded the Pat Metheny Group. Mays had an extraordinary career as a core musical architect and sound designer of the group for more than three decades. He won total 11 Grammy awards and was nominated 23 times.After the Pat Metheny Group\u2019s monumental achievement The Way Up in 2005, and the unofficial Songbook Tour in Europe and Japan in 2010, Mays decided to have a semi-retirement, although he performed at the Western Michigan University Jazz Club in 2010 and at a Ted Talk event at Caltech in 2011 with his own groups. In an interview with JAZZIZ magazine in 2016, Mays said he had been working as a  software manager because of changes in the music industry.\n\n\n== Work ==\nMays composed, orchestrated, and arranged as a core member of the Pat Metheny Group, playing piano, organ, synthesizers, and occasionally trumpet, accordion, agog\u00f4 bells,  autoharp,  toy xylophone,  and electric guitar.  He composed and recorded children's audiobooks, such as East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Moses the Lawgiver, The Lion and the Lamb, The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher, and Tale of Peter Rabbit with text read by Meryl Streep. In 1985, Metheny's and Mays's compositions were performed by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in the critically-acclaimed production of Orphans by Lyle Kessler. Lyle's Oberheim analog synth pad and his voice counting the second hand of a clock at the recording session, \"55..., 3..,\" which can be heard from the bridge part of \"As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls (1981),\" was used for Christian Dior's Fahrenheit Cologne commercials for almost 30 years, from 1988 to 2016.He was regarded by both professional musicians and music fans as one of the most innovative and creative contemporary jazz pianists and keyboardists, but as a composer, he was even more serious about classical music in terms of advanced harmonic aesthetics and structural development through long forms. He composed several contemporary classical pieces, such as \"Twelve Days in the Shadow of a Miracle\", a piece for harp, flute, viola, and synthesizer recorded in 1996 by the Debussy Trio. Mays also composed \u201cDistance\u201d for Pat Metheny Group\u2019s Grammy-winning and RIAA-certified Gold album, Still Life (1987, Geffen), \"Mindwalk\"  in 2009 for renowned marimba player, Nancy Zeltsman, and previously \"Somewhere in Maine\"  in 1988 for her duo with violinist Sharan Leventhal, Marimolin, and \u201cStreet Dreams 3\u201d for his solo album, Street Dreams (Geffen, 1988) with top classical performers in New York City.  \nApart from the Metheny group, he recorded or performed in a trio with Marc Johnson (contrabass), Jack DeJohnette (drums), and Peter Erskine (drums) and formed the Lyle Mays Quartet with Marc Johnson or Eric Hochberg (contrabass), Mark Walker (drums), and Bob Sheppard (saxophone). Naxos Germany released the quartet\u2019s live album The Ludwigsburg Concert recorded in 1993 and released in 2015.He collaborated with electronic keyboard instrument makers, Kurzweil and Korg, to develop their new sounds since he had great knowledge of both computer programming and music synthesis that he learned by himself.  \nThe renowned R&B/funk group, Earth, Wind & Fire, recorded Lyle's most beloved original composition from his first solo album, \"Close to Home\" for their 1990 album, Heritage as an interlude and he participated in the arranging and recording session for the piece.  The prominent Brazilian singer-songwriter, Milton Nascimento, also recorded a remake version of the same piece, \"Quem \u00e9 Voc\u00ea,\" with Portuguese lyrics for his 1991 album, O Planeta Blue Na Estrada Do Sol.

His father was a postal worker. After his father's death, his mother married a musician, who introduced him to the arts. He was soon allowed to enroll in the \u00c9cole nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon, where he studied with Joseph Chinard and Joseph Charles Marin. In 1817, he obtained a grant from the city for a study trip to Rome.

    "Gettysburg, Washington": "The Battle of Gettysburg (locally  (listen)) was fought July 1\u20133, 1863, in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, by Union and Confederate forces during the American Civil War. In the battle, Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, halting Lee's invasion of the North. The battle involved the largest number of casualties of the entire war and is often described as the war's turning point due to the Union's decisive victory and concurrence with the Siege of Vicksburg.After his success at Chancellorsville in Virginia in May 1863, Lee led his army through the Shenandoah Valley to begin his second invasion of the North\u2014the Gettysburg Campaign. With his army in high spirits, Lee intended to shift the focus of the summer campaign from war-ravaged northern Virginia and hoped to influence Northern politicians to give up their prosecution of the war by penetrating as far as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, or even Philadelphia. Prodded by President Abraham Lincoln, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker moved his army in pursuit, but was relieved of command just three days before the battle and replaced by Meade.\nElements of the two armies initially collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated his forces there, his objective being to engage the Union army and destroy it. Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating through the streets of the town to the hills just to the south. On the second day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. The Union line was laid out in a defensive formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on the Union left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On the Union right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill. All across the battlefield, despite significant losses, the Union defenders held their lines.\nOn the third day of battle, fighting resumed on Culp's Hill, and cavalry battles raged to the east and south, but the main event was a dramatic infantry assault by 12,500 Confederates against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge, known as Pickett's Charge. The charge was repelled by Union rifle and artillery fire, at great loss to the Confederate army. Lee led his army on a torturous retreat back to Virginia. Between 46,000 and 51,000 soldiers from both armies were casualties in the three-day battle, the most costly in US history. On November 19, President Lincoln used the dedication ceremony for the Gettysburg National Cemetery to honor the fallen Union soldiers and redefine the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== Military situation ===\n\nShortly after the Army of Northern Virginia won a major victory over the Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Chancellorsville (April 30 \u2013 May 6, 1863), Robert E. Lee decided upon a second invasion of the North (the first was the unsuccessful Maryland campaign of September 1862, which ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam). Such a move would upset the Union's plans for the summer campaigning season and possibly reduce the pressure on the besieged Confederate garrison at Vicksburg. The invasion would allow the Confederates to live off the bounty of the rich Northern farms while giving war-ravaged Virginia a much-needed rest. In addition, Lee's 72,000-man army could threaten Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and possibly strengthen the growing peace movement in the North.\n\n\n=== Initial movements to battle ===\nThus, on June 3, Lee's army began to shift northward from Fredericksburg, Virginia. Following the death of Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson, Lee reorganized his two large corps into three new corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet (First Corps), Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell (Second), and Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill (Third); both Ewell and Hill, who had formerly reported to Jackson as division commanders, were new to this level of responsibility. The Cavalry Division remained under the command of Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart.The Union Army of the Potomac, under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, consisted of seven infantry corps, a cavalry corps, and an Artillery Reserve, for a combined strength of more than 100,000 men.The first major action of the campaign took place on June 9 between cavalry forces at Brandy Station, near Culpeper, Virginia. The 9,500 Confederate cavalrymen under Stuart were surprised by Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton's combined arms force of two cavalry divisions (8,000 troopers) and 3,000 infantry, but Stuart eventually repelled the Union attack. The inconclusive battle, the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the war, proved for the first time that the Union horse soldier was equal to his Southern counterpart.By mid-June, the Army of Northern Virginia was poised to cross the Potomac River and enter Maryland. After defeating the Union garrisons at Winchester and Martinsburg, Ewell's Second Corps began crossing the river on June 15. Hill's and Longstreet's corps followed on June 24 and 25. Hooker's army pursued, keeping between Washington, D.C. and Lee's army. The Union army crossed the Potomac from June 25 to 27.Lee gave strict orders for his army to minimize any negative effects on the civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 1,000 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.On June 26, elements of Maj. Gen. Jubal Early's division of Ewell's Corps occupied the town of Gettysburg after chasing off newly raised Pennsylvania militia in a series of minor skirmishes. Early laid the borough under tribute, but did not collect any significant supplies. Soldiers burned several railroad cars and a covered bridge, and destroyed nearby rails and telegraph lines. The following morning, Early departed for adjacent York County.Meanwhile, in a controversial move, Lee allowed J.E.B. Stuart to take a portion of the army's cavalry and ride around the east flank of the Union army. Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals share the blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, as well as for the failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By June 29, Lee's army was strung out in an arc from Chambersburg (28 miles (45 km) northwest of Gettysburg) to Carlisle (30 miles (48 km) north of Gettysburg) to near Harrisburg and Wrightsville on the Susquehanna River.In a dispute over the use of the forces defending the Harpers Ferry garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck, who were looking for an excuse to rid themselves of him, immediately accepted. They replaced Hooker early on the morning of June 28 with Maj. Gen. George Gordon Meade, then commander of the V Corps.On June 29, when Lee learned that the Army of the Potomac had crossed the Potomac River, he ordered a concentration of his forces around Cashtown, located at the eastern base of South Mountain and eight miles (13 km) west of Gettysburg. On June 30, while part of Hill's Corps was in Cashtown, one of Hill's brigades, North Carolinians under Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, ventured toward Gettysburg. In his memoirs, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth, Pettigrew's division commander, claimed that he sent Pettigrew to search for supplies in town\u2014especially shoes.When Pettigrew's troops approached Gettysburg on June 30, they noticed Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. John Buford arriving south of town, and Pettigrew returned to Cashtown without engaging them. When Pettigrew told Hill and Heth what he had seen, neither general believed that there was a substantial Union force in or near the town, suspecting that it had been only Pennsylvania militia. Despite General Lee's order to avoid a general engagement until his entire army was concentrated, Hill decided to mount a significant reconnaissance in force the following morning to determine the size and strength of the enemy force in his front. Around 5 a.m. on Wednesday, July 1, two brigades of Heth's division advanced to Gettysburg.\n\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n\n\n=== Union ===\n\nThe Army of the Potomac, initially under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker (Maj. Gen. George Meade replaced Hooker in command on June 28), consisted of more than 100,000 men in the following organization:\nI Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. James S. Wadsworth, Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson, and Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday.\nII Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gens. John C. Caldwell, John Gibbon, and Alexander Hays.\nIII Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles, with divisions commanded by Maj. Gen. David B. Birney and Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys.\nV Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Sykes (George G. Meade until June 28), with divisions commanded by Brig. Gens. James Barnes, Romeyn B. Ayres, and Samuel W. Crawford.\nVI Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Horatio G. Wright, Brig. Gen. Albion P. Howe, and Maj. Gen. John Newton.\nXI Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr, and Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz.\nXII Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gens. Alpheus S. Williams and John W. Geary.\nCavalry Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, with divisions commanded by Brig. Gens. John Buford, David McM. Gregg, and H. Judson Kilpatrick.\nArtillery Reserve, commanded by Brig. Gen. Robert O. Tyler. (The preeminent artillery officer at Gettysburg was Brig. Gen. Henry J. Hunt, chief of artillery on Meade's staff.)During the advance on Gettysburg, Maj. Gen. Reynolds was in operational command of the left, or advanced, wing of the Army, consisting of the I, III, and XI Corps. Note that many other Union units (not part of the Army of the Potomac) were actively involved in the Gettysburg Campaign, but not directly involved in the Battle of Gettysburg. These included portions of the Union IV Corps, the militia and state troops of the Department of the Susquehanna, and various garrisons, including that at Harpers Ferry.\n\n\n=== Confederate ===\n\nIn reaction to the death of Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson after Chancellorsville, Lee reorganized his Army of Northern Virginia (75,000 men) from two infantry corps into three.\nFirst Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, with divisions commanded by Maj. Gens. Lafayette McLaws, George Pickett, and John Bell Hood.\nSecond Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, with divisions commanded by Maj. Gens. Jubal A. Early, Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson, and Robert E. Rodes.\nThird Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. A. P. Hill, with divisions commanded by Maj. Gens. Richard H. Anderson, Henry Heth, and W. Dorsey Pender.\nCavalry division, commanded by Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart, with brigades commanded by Brig. Gens. Wade Hampton, Fitzhugh Lee, Beverly H. Robertson, Albert G. Jenkins, William E. \"Grumble\" Jones, and John D. Imboden, and Col. John R. Chambliss.\n\n\n== First day of battle ==\n\n\n=== Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge ===\nAnticipating that the Confederates would march on Gettysburg from the west on the morning of July 1, Buford laid out his defenses on three ridges west of the town: Herr Ridge, McPherson Ridge and Seminary Ridge. These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small cavalry division against superior Confederate infantry forces, meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town at Cemetery Hill, Cemetery Ridge, and Culp's Hill. Buford understood that if the Confederates could gain control of these heights, Meade's army would have difficulty dislodging them.\n\nConfederate General Henry Heth's division advanced with two brigades forward, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis. They proceeded easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5 km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m. on July 1, the two brigades met light resistance from vedettes of Union cavalry, and deployed into line. According to lore, the Union soldier to fire the first shot of the battle was Lt. Marcellus Jones.  Lt. Jones later returned to Gettysburg, in 1886 erecting a monument marking the spot where he fired the first shot. Eventually Heth's men encountered dismounted troopers of Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The dismounted troopers resisted stoutly, delaying the Confederate advance by firing their breechloading carbines from behind fences and trees. Still, by 10:20 a.m., the Confederates had pushed the Union cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge, when the vanguard of the I Corps (Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds) finally arrived.North of the pike, Davis gained a temporary success against Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's brigade but was repelled with heavy losses in an action around an unfinished railroad bed cut in the ridge. South of the pike, Archer's brigade assaulted through Herbst (also known as McPherson's) Woods. The Union Iron Brigade under Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith enjoyed initial success against Archer, capturing several hundred men, including Archer himself.General Reynolds was shot and killed early in the fighting while directing troop and artillery placements just to the east of the woods. Shelby Foote wrote that the Union cause lost a man considered by many to be \"the best general in the army.\" Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday assumed command. Fighting in the Chambersburg Pike area lasted until about 12:30 p.m. It resumed around 2:30 p.m., when Heth's entire division engaged, adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Col. John M. Brockenbrough.As Pettigrew's North Carolina Brigade came on line, they flanked the 19th Indiana and drove the Iron Brigade back. The 26th North Carolina (the largest regiment in the army with 839 men) lost heavily, leaving the first day's fight with around 212 men. By the end of the three-day battle, they had about 152 men standing, the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment, North or South. Slowly the Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods toward Seminary Ridge. Hill added Maj. Gen. William Dorsey Pender's division to the assault, and the I Corps was driven back through the grounds of the Lutheran Seminary and Gettysburg streets.As the fighting to the west proceeded, two divisions of Ewell's Second Corps, marching west toward Cashtown in accordance with Lee's order for the army to concentrate in that vicinity, turned south on the Carlisle and Harrisburg roads toward Gettysburg, while the Union XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) raced north on the Baltimore Pike and Taneytown Road. By early afternoon, the Union line ran in a semicircle west, north, and northeast of Gettysburg.However, the Union did not have enough troops; Cutler, whose brigade was deployed north of the Chambersburg Pike, had his right flank in the air. The leftmost division of the XI Corps was unable to deploy in time to strengthen the line, so Doubleday was forced to throw in reserve brigades to salvage his line.Around 2 p.m., the Confederate Second Corps divisions of Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Jubal Early assaulted and out-flanked the Union I and XI Corps positions north and northwest of town. The Confederate brigades of Col. Edward A. O'Neal and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson suffered severe losses assaulting the I Corps division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson south of Oak Hill. Early's division profited from a blunder by Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow, when he advanced his XI Corps division to Blocher's Knoll (directly north of town and now known as Barlow's Knoll); this represented a salient in the corps line, susceptible to attack from multiple sides, and Early's troops overran Barlow's division, which constituted the right flank of the Union Army's position. Barlow was wounded and captured in the attack.As Union positions collapsed both north and west of town, Gen. Howard ordered a retreat to the high ground south of town at Cemetery Hill, where he had left the division of Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr in reserve. Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock assumed command of the battlefield, sent by Meade when he heard that Reynolds had been killed. Hancock, commander of the II Corps and Meade's most trusted subordinate, was ordered to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle. Hancock told Howard, \"I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw.\" When Howard agreed, Hancock concluded the discussion: \"Very well, sir, I select this as the battle-field.\" Hancock's determination had a morale-boosting effect on the retreating Union soldiers, but he played no direct tactical role on the first day.General Lee understood the defensive potential to the Union if they held this high ground. He sent orders to Ewell that Cemetery Hill be taken \"if practicable.\" Ewell, who had previously served under Stonewall Jackson, a general well known for issuing peremptory orders, determined such an assault was not practicable and, thus, did not attempt it; this decision is considered by historians to be a great missed opportunity.The first day at Gettysburg, more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days, ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged. About one quarter of Meade's army (22,000 men) and one third of Lee's army (27,000) were engaged.\n\n\n== Second day of battle ==\n\n\n=== Plans and movement to battle ===\nThroughout the evening of July 1 and morning of July 2, most of the remaining infantry of both armies arrived on the field, including the Union II, III, V, VI, and XII Corps. Two of Longstreet's divisions were on the road: Brig. Gen. George Pickett, had begun the 22 mile (35 km) march from Chambersburg, while Brig. Gen. E. M. Law had begun the march from Guilford. Both arrived late in the morning. Law completed his 28-mile (45 km) march in eleven hours.The Union line ran from Culp's Hill southeast of the town, northwest to Cemetery Hill just south of town, then south for nearly two miles (3 km) along Cemetery Ridge, terminating just north of Little Round Top. Most of the XII Corps was on Culp's Hill; the remnants of I and XI Corps defended Cemetery Hill; II Corps covered most of the northern half of Cemetery Ridge; and III Corps was ordered to take up a position to its flank. The shape of the Union line is popularly described as a \"fishhook\" formation.The Confederate line paralleled the Union line about a mile (1,600 m) to the west on Seminary Ridge, ran east through the town, then curved southeast to a point opposite Culp's Hill. Thus, the Union army had interior lines, while the Confederate line was nearly five miles (8 km) long.Lee's battle plan for July 2 called for a general assault of Meade's positions. On the right, Longstreet's First Corps was to position itself to attack the Union left flank, facing northeast astraddle the Emmitsburg Road, and to roll up the Union line. The attack sequence was to begin with Maj. Gens. John Bell Hood's and Lafayette McLaws's divisions, followed by Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's division of Hill's Third Corps.On the left, Lee instructed Ewell to position his Second Corps to attack Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill when he heard the gunfire from Longstreet's assault, preventing Meade from shifting troops to bolster his left. Though it does not appear in either his or Lee's Official Report, Ewell claimed years later that Lee had changed the order to simultaneously attack, calling for only a \"diversion\", to be turned into a full-scale attack if a favorable opportunity presented itself.Lee's plan, however, was based on faulty intelligence, exacerbated by Stuart's continued absence from the battlefield. Though Lee personally reconnoitered his left during the morning, he did not visit Longstreet's position on the Confederate right. Even so, Lee rejected suggestions that Longstreet move beyond Meade's left and attack the Union flank, capturing the supply trains and effectively blocking Meade's escape route.Lee did not issue orders for the attack until 11:00 a.m. About noon, General Anderson's advancing troops were discovered by General Sickles' outpost guard and the Third Corps\u2013upon which Longstreet's First Corps was to form\u2013did not get into position until 1:00 p.m.Hood and McLaws, after their long march, were not yet in position and did not launch their attacks until just after 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., respectively.\n\n\n=== Attacks on the Union left flank ===\n\nAs Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, advanced, they unexpectedly found Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps directly in their path. Sickles had been dissatisfied with the position assigned him on the southern end of Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a half mile (800 m) to the west\u2014centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard\u2014he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00 p.m. After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.Meade was forced to send 20,000 reinforcements: the entire V Corps, Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell's division of the II Corps, most of the XII Corps, and portions of the newly arrived VI Corps. Hood's division moved more to the east than intended, losing its alignment with the Emmitsburg Road, attacking Devil's Den and Little Round Top. McLaws, coming in on Hood's left, drove multiple attacks into the thinly stretched III Corps in the Wheatfield and overwhelmed them in Sherfy's Peach Orchard. McLaws's attack eventually reached Plum Run Valley (the \"Valley of Death\") before being beaten back by the Pennsylvania Reserves division of the V Corps, moving down from Little Round Top. The III Corps was virtually destroyed as a combat unit in this battle, and Sickles's leg was amputated after it was shattered by a cannonball. Caldwell's division was destroyed piecemeal in the Wheatfield. Anderson's division, coming from McLaws's left and starting forward around 6 p.m., reached the crest of Cemetery Ridge, but could not hold the position in the face of counterattacks from the II Corps, including an almost suicidal bayonet charge by the 1st Minnesota regiment against a Confederate brigade, ordered in desperation by Hancock to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.As fighting raged in the Wheatfield and Devil's Den, Col. Strong Vincent of V Corps had a precarious hold on Little Round Top, an important hill at the extreme left of the Union line. His brigade of four relatively small regiments was able to resist repeated assaults by Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law's brigade of Hood's division. Meade's chief engineer, Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, had realized the importance of this position, and dispatched Vincent's brigade, an artillery battery, and the 140th New York to occupy Little Round Top mere minutes before Hood's troops arrived. The defense of Little Round Top with a bayonet charge by the 20th Maine, ordered by Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain but possibly led by Lt. Holman S. Melcher, was one of the most fabled episodes in the Civil War and propelled Col. Chamberlain into prominence after the war.\n\n\n=== Attacks on the Union right flank ===\n\nEwell interpreted his orders as calling only for a cannonade. His 32 guns, along with A. P. Hill's 55 guns, engaged in a two-hour artillery barrage at extreme range that had little effect. Finally, about six o'clock, Ewell sent orders to each of his division commanders to attack the Union lines in his front.Maj. Gen. Edward \"Allegheny\" Johnson's Division had contemplated an assault on Culp's Hill, but they were still a mile away and had Rock Creek to cross. The few possible crossings would make significant delays.  Because of this, only three of Johnson's four brigades moved to the attack. Most of the hill's defenders, the Union XII Corps, had been sent to the left to defend against Longstreet's attacks, leaving only a brigade of New Yorkers under Brig. Gen. George S. Greene behind strong, newly constructed defensive works. With reinforcements from the I and XI Corps, Greene's men held off the Confederate attackers, though giving up some of the lower earthworks on the lower part of Culp's Hill.Early was similarly unprepared when he ordered Harry T. Hays' and Isaac E. Avery's Brigades to attack the Union XI Corps positions on East Cemetery Hill. Once started, fighting was fierce: Col. Andrew L. Harris of the Union 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, came under a withering attack, losing half his men. Avery was wounded early on, but the Confederates reached the crest of the hill and entered the Union breastworks, capturing one or two batteries. Seeing he was not supported on his right, Hays withdrew. His right was to be supported by Robert E. Rodes' Division, but Rodes\u2014like Early and Johnson\u2014had not been ordered up in preparation for the attack. He had twice as far to travel as Early; by the time he came in contact with the Union skirmish line, Early's troops had already begun to withdraw.Jeb Stuart and his three cavalry brigades arrived in Gettysburg around noon but had no role in the second day's battle. Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton's brigade fought a minor engagement with newly promoted 23-year-old Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer's Michigan cavalry near Hunterstown to the northeast of Gettysburg.\n\n\n== Third day of battle ==\n\n\n=== Lee's plan ===\nGeneral Lee wished to renew the attack on Friday, July 3, using the same basic plan as the previous day: Longstreet would attack the Union left, while Ewell attacked Culp's Hill. However, before Longstreet was ready, Union XII Corps troops started a dawn artillery bombardment against the Confederates on Culp's Hill in an effort to regain a portion of their lost works. The Confederates attacked, and the second fight for Culp's Hill ended around 11 a.m. Harry Pfanz judged that, after some seven hours of bitter combat, \"the Union line was intact and held more strongly than before.\"Lee was forced to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia division of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in an attack on the Union II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring to bear on the Union positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.Much has been made over the years of General Longstreet's objections to General Lee's plan. In his memoirs, Longstreet described their discussion as follows:\n\n[Lee] rode over after sunrise and gave his orders. His plan was to assault the enemy's left centre by a column to be composed of McLaws's and Hood's divisions reinforced by Pickett's brigades. I thought that it would not do; that the point had been fully tested the day before, by more men, when all were fresh; that the enemy was there looking for us, as we heard him during the night putting up his defences; that the divisions of McLaws and Hood were holding a mile [1,600 m] along the right of my line against twenty thousand men, who would follow their withdrawal, strike the flank of the assaulting column, crush it, and get on our rear towards the Potomac River; that thirty thousand men was the minimum of force necessary for the work; that even such force would need close co-operation on other parts of the line; that the column as he proposed to organize it would have only about thirteen thousand men (the divisions having lost a third of their numbers the day before); that the column would have to march a mile [1,600 m] under concentrating battery fire, and a thousand yards [900 m] under long-range musketry; that the conditions were different from those in the days of Napoleon, when field batteries had a range of six hundred yards [550 m] and musketry about sixty yards [55 m].\nHe said the distance was not more than fourteen hundred yards [1280 m]. General Meade's estimate was a mile or a mile and a half [1.6 or 2.4 km] (Captain Long, the guide of the field of Gettysburg in 1888, stated that it was a trifle over a mile). He then concluded that the divisions of McLaws and Hood could remain on the defensive line; that he would reinforce by divisions of the Third Corps and Pickett's brigades, and stated the point to which the march should be directed. I asked the strength of the column. He stated fifteen thousand. Opinion was then expressed that the fifteen thousand men who could make successful assault over that field had never been arrayed for battle; but he was impatient of listening, and tired of talking, and nothing was left but to proceed.\n\n\n=== Largest artillery bombardment of the war ===\nAround 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns began an artillery bombardment that was probably the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 Union cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.\n\n\n=== Pickett's Charge ===\nAround 3 p.m., the cannon fire subsided, and 12,500 Southern soldiers stepped from the ridgeline and advanced the three-quarters of a mile (1,200 m) to Cemetery Ridge in what is known to history as \"Pickett's Charge\". As the Confederates approached, there was fierce flanking artillery fire from Union positions on Cemetery Hill and north of Little Round Top, and musket and canister fire from Hancock's II Corps. In the Union center, the commander of artillery had held fire during the Confederate bombardment (in order to save it for the infantry assault, which Meade had correctly predicted the day before), leading Southern commanders to believe the Northern cannon batteries had been knocked out. However, they opened fire on the Confederate infantry during their approach with devastating results. Nearly one half of the attackers did not return to their own lines.Although the Union line wavered and broke temporarily at a jog called the \"Angle\" in a low stone fence, just north of a patch of vegetation called the Copse of Trees, reinforcements rushed into the breach, and the Confederate attack was repelled. The farthest advance, by Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead's brigade of Maj. Gen. George Pickett's division at the Angle, is referred to as the \"High-water mark of the Confederacy\". Union and Confederate soldiers locked in hand-to-hand combat, attacking with their rifles, bayonets, rocks and even their bare hands. Armistead ordered his Confederates to turn two captured cannons against Union troops, but discovered that there was no ammunition left, the last double canister shots having been used against the charging Confederates. Armistead was wounded shortly afterward three times.\n\n\n=== Cavalry battles ===\nThere were two significant cavalry engagements on July 3. Stuart was sent to guard the Confederate left flank and was to be prepared to exploit any success the infantry might achieve on Cemetery Hill by flanking the Union right and hitting their trains and lines of communications. Three miles (5 km) east of Gettysburg, in what is now called \"East Cavalry Field\" (not shown on the accompanying map, but between the York and Hanover Roads), Stuart's forces collided with Union cavalry: Brig. Gen. David McMurtrie Gregg's division and Brig. Gen. Custer's brigade. A lengthy mounted battle, including hand-to-hand sabre combat, ensued. Custer's charge, leading the 1st Michigan Cavalry, blunted the attack by Wade Hampton's brigade, blocking Stuart from achieving his objectives in the Union rear.Meanwhile, after hearing news of the day's victory, Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick launched a cavalry attack against the infantry positions of Longstreet's Corps southwest of Big Round Top. Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth protested against the futility of such a move, but obeyed orders. Farnsworth was killed in the attack, and his brigade suffered significant losses.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Casualties ===\n\nThe two armies suffered between 46,000 and 51,000 casualties, nearly one third of all total troops engaged, 28% of the Army of the Potomac and 37% of the Army of Northern Virginia. Union casualties were 23,055 (3,155 killed, 14,531 wounded, 5,369 captured or missing), while Confederate casualties are more difficult to estimate. Many authors have referred to as many as 28,000 Confederate casualties, and Busey and Martin's more recent 2005 work, Regimental Strengths and Losses at Gettysburg, documents 23,231 (4,708 killed, 12,693 wounded, 5,830 captured or missing). Nearly a third of Lee's general officers were killed, wounded, or captured. The casualties for both sides during the entire campaign were 57,225.In addition to being the deadliest battle of the war, Gettysburg also had the highest number of generals killed in action. The Confederacy lost generals Paul Jones Semmes, William Barksdale, William Dorsey Pender, Richard Garnett, and Lewis Armistead, as well as J. Johnston Pettigrew during the retreat after the battle. The Union lost Generals John Reynolds, Samuel K. Zook, Stephen H. Weed, and Elon J. Farnsworth, as well as Strong Vincent, who after being mortally wounded was given a deathbed promotion to brigadier general. Additional senior officer casualties included the wounding of Union Generals Dan Sickles (lost a leg), Francis C. Barlow, Daniel Butterfield, and Winfield Scott Hancock. For the Confederacy, Major General John Bell Hood lost the use of his left arm, while Major General Henry Heth received a shot to the head on the first day of battle (though incapacitated for the rest of the battle, he remarkably survived without long-term injuries, credited in part due to his hat stuffed full of paper dispatches). Confederate Generals James L. Kemper and Isaac R. Trimble were severely wounded during Pickett's charge and captured during the Confederate retreat. General James J. Archer, in command of a brigade that most likely was responsible for killing Reynolds, was taken prisoner shortly after Reynolds' death.The following tables summarize casualties by corps for the Union and Confederate forces during the three-day battle.\n\nBruce Catton wrote, \"The town of Gettysburg looked as if some universal moving day had been interrupted by catastrophe.\" But there was only one documented civilian death during the battle: Ginnie Wade (also widely known as Jennie), 20 years old, was hit by a stray bullet that passed through her kitchen in town while she was making bread. Another notable civilian casualty was John L. Burns, a 69-year old veteran of the War of 1812 who walked to the front lines on the first day of battle and participated in heavy combat as a volunteer, receiving numerous wounds in the process. Despite his age and injuries, Burns survived the battle and lived until 1872. Nearly 8,000 had been killed outright; these bodies, lying in the hot summer sun, needed to be buried quickly. Over 3,000 horse carcasses were burned in a series of piles south of town; townsfolk became violently ill from the stench. Meanwhile, the town of Gettysburg, with its population of just 2,400, found itself tasked with taking care of 14,000 wounded Union troops and an additional 8,000 Confederate prisoners.\n\n\n=== Confederate retreat ===\n\nThe armies stared at one another in a heavy rain across the bloody fields on July 4, the same day that, some 900 miles (1,500 km) away, the Vicksburg garrison surrendered to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Lee had reformed his lines into a defensive position on Seminary Ridge the night of July 3, evacuating the town of Gettysburg. The Confederates remained on the battlefield, hoping that Meade would attack, but the cautious Union commander decided against the risk, a decision for which he would later be criticized. Both armies began to collect their remaining wounded and bury some of the dead. A proposal by Lee for a prisoner exchange was rejected by Meade.Lee started his Army of Northern Virginia in motion late the evening of July 4 towards Fairfield and Chambersburg. Cavalry under Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden was entrusted to escort the miles-long wagon train of supplies and wounded men that Lee wanted to take back to Virginia with him, using the route through Cashtown and Hagerstown to Williamsport, Maryland. Meade's army followed, although the pursuit was half-spirited. The recently rain-swollen Potomac trapped Lee's army on the north bank of the river for a time, but when the Union troops finally caught up, the Confederates had forded the river. The rear-guard action at Falling Waters on July 14 added some more names to the long casualty lists, including General Pettigrew, who was mortally wounded. General James L. Kemper, severely wounded during Pickett's charge, was captured during Lee's retreat.In a brief letter to Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck written on July 7, Lincoln remarked on the two major Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. He continued:\n\nNow, if Gen. Meade can complete his work so gloriously prosecuted thus far, by the literal or substantial destruction of Lee's army, the rebellion will be over.\nHalleck then relayed the contents of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram.  However, the Army of the Potomac was exhausted by days of fighting and heavy losses.  Furthermore, Meade was forced to detach 4,000 troops north to suppress the New York City Draft Riots, further reducing the effectiveness of his pursuit. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to destroy it before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor Battle of Manassas Gap, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions across from each other on the Rappahannock River.\n\n\n=== Union reaction to the news of the victory ===\nThe news of the Union victory electrified the North. A headline in The Philadelphia Inquirer proclaimed \"VICTORY! WATERLOO ECLIPSED!\" New York diarist George Templeton Strong wrote:\nThe results of this victory are priceless. ... The charm of Robert E. Lee's invincibility is broken. The Army of the Potomac has at last found a general that can handle it, and has stood nobly up to its terrible work in spite of its long disheartening list of hard-fought failures. ... Copperheads are palsied and dumb for the moment at least. ... Government is strengthened four-fold at home and abroad.\nHowever, the Union enthusiasm soon dissipated as the public realized that Lee's army had escaped destruction and the war would continue. Lincoln complained to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles that \"Our army held the war in the hollow of their hand and they would not close it!\" Brig. Gen. Alexander S. Webb wrote to his father on July 17, stating that such Washington politicians as \"Chase, Seward and others,\" disgusted with Meade, \"write to me that Lee really won that Battle!\"\n\n\n=== Effect on the Confederacy ===\nIn fact, the Confederates had lost militarily and also politically. During the final hours of the battle, Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens was approaching the Union lines at Norfolk, Virginia, under a flag of truce. Although his formal instructions from Confederate President Jefferson Davis had limited his powers to negotiate on prisoner exchanges and other procedural matters, historian James M. McPherson speculates that he had informal goals of presenting peace overtures. Davis had hoped that Stephens would reach Washington from the south while Lee's victorious army was marching toward it from the north. President Lincoln, upon hearing of the Gettysburg results, refused Stephens's request to pass through the lines. Furthermore, when the news reached London, any lingering hopes of European recognition of the Confederacy were finally abandoned. Henry Adams, whose father was serving as the U.S ambassador to the United Kingdom at the time, wrote, \"The disasters of the rebels are unredeemed by even any hope of success. It is now conceded that all idea of intervention is at an end.\"Compounding the effects of the defeat was the end of the Siege of Vicksburg, which surrendered to Grant's Federal armies in the West on July 4, the day after the Gettysburg battle.The immediate reaction of the Southern military and public sectors was that Gettysburg was a setback, not a disaster. The sentiment was that Lee had been successful on July 1 and had fought a valiant battle on July 2\u20133, but could not dislodge the Union Army from the strong defensive position to which it fled. The Confederates successfully stood their ground on July 4 and withdrew only after they realized Meade would not attack them. The withdrawal to the Potomac that could have been a disaster was handled masterfully. Furthermore, the Army of the Potomac had been kept away from Virginia farmlands for the summer and all predicted that Meade would be too timid to threaten them for the rest of the year. Lee himself had a positive view of the campaign, writing to his wife that the army had returned \"rather sooner than I had originally contemplated, but having accomplished what I proposed on leaving the Rappahannock, viz., relieving the Valley of the presence of the enemy and drawing his Army north of the Potomac.\" He was quoted as saying to Maj. John Seddon, brother of the Confederate secretary of war, \"Sir, we did whip them at Gettysburg, and it will be seen for the next six months that that army will be as quiet as a sucking dove.\" Some Southern publications, such as the Charleston Mercury, were critical of Lee's actions. On August 8, Lee offered his resignation to President Davis, who quickly rejected it.Gettysburg became a postbellum focus of the \"Lost Cause\", a movement by writers such as Edward A. Pollard and Jubal Early to explain the reasons for the Confederate defeat in the war. A fundamental premise of their argument was that the South was doomed because of the overwhelming advantage in manpower and industrial might possessed by the North. They also contend that Robert E. Lee, who up until this time had been almost invincible, was betrayed by the failures of some of his key subordinates at Gettysburg: Ewell, for failing to seize Cemetery Hill on July 1; Stuart, for depriving the army of cavalry intelligence for a key part of the campaign; and especially Longstreet, for failing to attack on July 2 as early and as forcefully as Lee had originally intended. In this view, Gettysburg was seen as a great lost opportunity, in which a decisive victory by Lee could have meant the end of the war in the Confederacy's favor.After the war, General Pickett was asked why Confederates lost at Gettysburg. He was reported to have said, \"I always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.\"\n\n\n=== Gettysburg Address ===\n\nThe ravages of war were still evident in Gettysburg more than four months later when, on November 19, the Soldiers' National Cemetery was dedicated. During this ceremony, President Abraham Lincoln honored the fallen and redefined the purpose of the war in his historic Gettysburg Address.\n\n\n=== Medal of Honor ===\n\nThere were 72 Medals of Honor awarded for the Gettysburg Campaign. 64 of the awards were for actions taken during the battle itself, with the first recipient being awarded in December 1864. The last Medal of Honor was posthumously awarded to Lieutenant Alonzo Cushing in 2014.\n\n\n== Historical assessment ==\n\n\n=== Decisive victory controversies ===\nThe nature of the result of the Battle of Gettysburg has been the subject of controversy. Although not seen as overwhelmingly significant at the time, particularly since the war continued for almost two years, in retrospect it has often been cited as the \"turning point\", usually in combination with the fall of Vicksburg the following day. This is based on the observation that, after Gettysburg, Lee's army conducted no more strategic offensives\u2014his army merely reacted to the initiative of Ulysses S. Grant in 1864 and 1865\u2014and by the speculative viewpoint of the Lost Cause writers that a Confederate victory at Gettysburg might have resulted in the end of the war.\n\nIt is currently a widely held view that Gettysburg was a decisive victory for the Union, but the term is considered imprecise. It is inarguable that Lee's offensive on July 3 was turned back decisively and his campaign in Pennsylvania was terminated prematurely (although the Confederates at the time argued that this was a temporary setback and that the goals of the campaign were largely met). However, when the more common definition of \"decisive victory\" is intended\u2014an indisputable military victory of a battle that determines or significantly influences the ultimate result of a conflict\u2014historians are divided. For example, David J. Eicher called Gettysburg a \"strategic loss for the Confederacy\" and James M. McPherson wrote that \"Lee and his men would go on to earn further laurels. But they never again possessed the power and reputation they carried into Pennsylvania those palmy summer days of 1863.\"However, Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones wrote that the \"strategic impact of the Battle of Gettysburg was ... fairly limited.\" Steven E. Woodworth wrote that \"Gettysburg proved only the near impossibility of decisive action in the Eastern theater.\" Edwin Coddington pointed out the heavy toll on the Army of the Potomac and that \"after the battle Meade no longer possessed a truly effective instrument for the accomplishments of his task. The army needed a thorough reorganization with new commanders and fresh troops, but these changes were not made until Grant appeared on the scene in March 1864.\" Joseph T. Glatthaar wrote that \"Lost opportunities and near successes plagued the Army of Northern Virginia during its Northern invasion,\" yet after Gettysburg, \"without the distractions of duty as an invading force, without the breakdown of discipline, the Army of Northern Virginia [remained] an extremely formidable force.\" Ed Bearss wrote, \"Lee's invasion of the North had been a costly failure. Nevertheless, at best the Army of the Potomac had simply preserved the strategic stalemate in the Eastern Theater ...\" Furthermore, the Confederacy soon proved it was still capable of winning significant victories over the Northern forces in both the East (Battle of Cold Harbor) and West (Battle of Chickamauga).Peter Carmichael refers to the military context for the armies, the \"horrendous losses at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, which effectively destroyed Lee's offensive capacity,\" implying that these cumulative losses were not the result of a single battle. Thomas Goss, writing in the U.S. Army's Military Review journal on the definition of \"decisive\" and the application of that description to Gettysburg, concludes: \"For all that was decided and accomplished, the Battle of Gettysburg fails to earn the label 'decisive battle'.\" The military historian John Keegan agrees. Gettysburg was a landmark battle, the largest of the war and it would not be surpassed. The Union had restored to it the belief in certain victory, and the loss dispirited the Confederacy. If \"not exactly a decisive battle\", Gettysburg was the end of Confederate use of Northern Virginia as a military buffer zone, the setting for Grant's Overland Campaign.\n\n\n=== Lee vs. Meade ===\n\nPrior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had established a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers\u2014although usually at the cost of high casualties to his army\u2014during the Seven Days, the Northern Virginia Campaign (including the Second Battle of Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Only the Maryland Campaign, with its tactically inconclusive Battle of Antietam, had been less than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health; and, (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.\n\nThroughout the campaign, Lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible; most of Lee's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this, including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1. Since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal, Lee did not want to dampen his army's desire to fight and resisted suggestions, principally by Longstreet, to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army. War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee \"acted, probably, under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable. If such was the case, he committed an error, such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into.\" Lee himself concurred with this judgment, writing to President Davis, \"No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me, nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public\u2014I am alone to blame, in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor.\"The most controversial assessments of the battle involve the performance of Lee's subordinates. The dominant theme of the Lost Cause writers and many other historians is that Lee's senior generals failed him in crucial ways, directly causing the loss of the battle; the alternative viewpoint is that Lee did not manage his subordinates adequately, and did not thereby compensate for their shortcomings. Two of his corps commanders\u2014Richard S. Ewell and A.P. Hill\u2014had only recently been promoted and were not fully accustomed to Lee's style of command, in which he provided only general objectives and guidance to their former commander, Stonewall Jackson; Jackson translated these into detailed, specific orders to his division commanders. All four of Lee's principal commanders received criticism during the campaign and battle:\nJames Longstreet suffered most severely from the wrath of the Lost Cause authors, not the least because he directly criticized Lee in postbellum writings and became a Republican after the war. His critics accuse him of attacking much later than Lee intended on July 2, squandering a chance to hit the Union Army before its defensive positions had firmed up. They also question his lack of motivation to attack strongly on July 2 and 3 because he had argued that the army should have maneuvered to a place where it would force Meade to attack them. The alternative view is that Lee was in close contact with Longstreet during the battle, agreed to delays on the morning of July 2, and never criticized Longstreet's performance. (There is also considerable speculation about what an attack might have looked like before Dan Sickles moved the III Corps toward the Peach Orchard.)\nJ.E.B. Stuart deprived Lee of cavalry intelligence during a good part of the campaign by taking his three best brigades on a path away from the army's. This arguably led to Lee's surprise at Hooker's vigorous pursuit; the engagement on July 1 that escalated into the full battle prematurely; and it also prevented Lee from understanding the full disposition of the enemy on July 2. The disagreements regarding Stuart's culpability for the situation originate in the relatively vague orders issued by Lee, but most modern historians agree that both generals were responsible to some extent for the failure of the cavalry's mission early in the campaign.\nRichard S. Ewell has been universally criticized for failing to seize the high ground on the afternoon of July 1. Once again the disagreement centers on Lee's orders, which provided general guidance for Ewell to act \"if practicable.\" Many historians speculate that Stonewall Jackson, if he had survived Chancellorsville, would have aggressively seized Culp's Hill, rendering Cemetery Hill indefensible, and changing the entire complexion of the battle. A differently worded order from Lee might have made the difference with this subordinate.\nA.P. Hill has received some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused the battle to begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee well informed of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement in the remainder of the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.\nIn addition to Hill's illness, Lee's performance was affected by heart troubles, which would eventually lead to his death in 1870; he had been diagnosed with pericarditis by his staff physicians in March 1863, though modern doctors believe he had in fact suffered a heart attack. He wrote to Jefferson Davis that his physical condition prevented him from offering full supervision in the field, and said, \"I am so dull that in making use of the eyes of others I am frequently misled.\"As a final factor, Lee faced a new and formidable opponent in George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well on its home territory. Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where and when they were needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.Lee was quoted before the battle as saying Meade \"would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take advantage of it.\" That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, \"The fact of the matter is that George G. Meade, unexpectedly and against all odds, thoroughly outgeneraled Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg.\" Edwin B. Coddington wrote that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac received a \"sense of triumph which grew into an imperishable faith in [themselves]. The men knew what they could do under an extremely competent general; one of lesser ability and courage could well have lost the battle.\"Meade had his own detractors as well. Similar to the situation with Lee, Meade suffered partisan attacks about his performance at Gettysburg, but he had the misfortune of experiencing them in person. Supporters of his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, lambasted Meade before the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, where Radical Republicans suspected that Meade was a Copperhead and tried in vain to relieve him from command. Daniel E. Sickles and Daniel Butterfield accused Meade of planning to retreat from Gettysburg during the battle. Most politicians, including Lincoln, criticized Meade for what they considered to be his half-hearted pursuit of Lee after the battle. A number of Meade's most competent subordinates\u2014Winfield S. Hancock, John Gibbon, Gouverneur K. Warren, and Henry J. Hunt, all heroes of the battle\u2014defended Meade in print, but Meade was embittered by the overall experience.\n\n\n== Battlefield preservation ==\nToday, the Gettysburg National Cemetery and Gettysburg National Military Park are maintained by the U.S. National Park Service as two of the nation's most revered historical landmarks. Although Gettysburg is one of the best known of all Civil War battlefields, it too faces threats to its preservation and interpretation. Many historically significant locations on the battlefield lie outside the boundaries of Gettysburg National Military Park and are vulnerable to residential or commercial development.On July 20, 2009, a Comfort Inn and Suites opened on Cemetery Hill, adjacent to Evergreen Cemetery, just one of many modern edifices infringing on the historic field. The Baltimore Pike corridor attracts development that concerns preservationists.Some preservation successes have emerged in recent years. Two proposals to open a casino at Gettysburg were defeated in 2006 and most recently in 2011, when public pressure forced the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to reject the proposed gambling hub at the intersection of Routes 15 and 30, near East Cavalry Field. The American Battlefield Trust, formerly the Civil War Trust, also successfully purchased and transferred 95 acres (38 ha) at the former site of the Gettysburg Country Club to the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2011.Less than half of the over 11,500 acres on the old Gettysburg Battlefield have been preserved for posterity thus far. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved 1,231 acres (4.98 km2) of the battlefield in more than 35 separate transactions since 1997. Some of these acres are now among the 4,998 acres (2,023 ha) of the Gettysburg National Military Park. In 2015, the Trust made one of its most important and expensive acquisitions, paying $6 million for a four-acre (1.6 ha) parcel that included the stone house that Confederate General Robert E. Lee used as his headquarters during the battle. The Trust razed a motel, restaurant and other buildings within the parcel to restore Lee's headquarters and the site to their wartime appearance, adding interpretive signs. It opened the site to the public in October 2016.\n\n\n== Commemoration in U.S. postage and coinage ==\nDuring the Civil War Centennial, the U.S. Post Office issued five postage stamps commemorating the 100th anniversaries of famous battles, as they occurred over a four-year period, beginning with the Battle of Fort Sumter Centennial issue of 1961. The Battle of Shiloh commemorative stamp was issued in 1962, the Battle of Gettysburg in 1963, the Battle of the Wilderness in 1964, and the Appomattox Centennial commemorative stamp in 1965.A commemorative half dollar for the Battle of Gettysburg was produced in 1936. As was typical for the period, mintage for the coin was very low, just 26,928. On January 24, 2011, a 25-cent coin was released in the America the Beautiful series commemorating Gettysburg National Military Park and the Battle of Gettysburg. The reverse side of the coin depicts the monument on Cemetery Ridge to the 72nd Pennsylvania Infantry.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nFilm records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, held on the battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), veterans re-enacted Pickett's Charge in a spirit of reconciliation, a meeting that carried great emotional force for both sides. At the 75th anniversary (1938), 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the rebel yell.\nThe Battle of Gettysburg was depicted in the 1993 film Gettysburg, based on Michael Shaara's 1974 novel The Killer Angels. The film and novel focused primarily on the actions of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, John Buford, Robert E. Lee, and James Longstreet during the battle. The first day focused on Buford's cavalry defense, the second day on Chamberlain's defense at Little Round Top, and the third day on Pickett's Charge.\nThe south winning the Battle of Gettysburg is a popular premise for a point of divergence in American Civil War alternate histories. Here are some examples which either depict or make significant reference to an alternate Battle of Gettysburg (sometimes simply inserting fantasy or sci-fi elements in an account of the battle):\n\nNovels: Bring the Jubilee by Ward Moore; If the South Had Won the Civil War by Mackinlay Kantor; Civil War Trilogy (Gettysburg, Grant Comes East, Never Call Retreat) by Newt Gingrich, William R. Forstchen, and Albert S. Hanser; Stonewall Jackson at Gettysburg by Douglas Lee Gibboney; By Force of Arms by Billy Bennett. Also: Harry Turtledove's Southern Victory series has an analogous battle taking place at Camp Hill, another southeast Pennsylvania town.\nShort fiction: \"If Lee Had NOT Won the Battle of Gettysburg\" by Winston Churchill in If It Had Happened Otherwise and If, or History Rewritten, \"Sidewise in Time\" by Murray Leinster in various collections, \"A Hard Day for Mother\" by William R.

    "Gaetano Mignani": "Gaetano Mignani (31 August 1882 \u2013 29 January 1973) was an Italian prelate of the Catholic Church. He served as Apostolic vicar of Kianfu (Ji'an Prefecture), he became the first Catholic Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ji'an when the region was elevated to a diocese in 1946, a position he would hold until 1951, when the new Communist government expelled him from the country.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn 31 August 1882 in Piumazza di Castelfranco Emilia, Bologna, Italy, Mignani was a member of the Congregation of the Mission, commonly known as the Vincentians, professing at 21 years of age in 1904.

    "Snodgrass Tavern": "Snodgrass Tavern is an historic tavern located near Hedgesville in Berkeley County, West Virginia.  The structure was built in stages beginning around 1742, and is one of the oldest buildings in West Virginia still standing.  It is uncertain when the structure became a tavern; but according to Early Hedgesville Chronicles 1720-1947, by William Moore,  an account of Robert Snodgrass's wife, Susannah and their first daughter, baby Elizabeth describes it having been used as a tavern during the Indian wars at the brink of the French and Indian War (early to mid 1750s). Specifically, they hid beneath the floors of the tavern, while the Indians drank and fought above. The tavern lasted until 1847, when the property was sold as a private residence. The structure and surrounding property is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt is unclear who built the original sections of the tavern.  One source states that in 1732, Lord Fairfax granted William Snodgrass a 1,000-acre (400 ha) tract of land in what is now Berkeley County, West Virginia, upon which he began building the tavern.  However, other sources claim John Ford began the original construction, selling the land at some point to the Rawlings family, who then sold the land to Robert Snodgrass in 1779.  Nevertheless, the Snodgrass name became associated with the tavern.  Beginning around 1742, construction of the building was begun.  The first section built was a 1+1\u20442-story square log structure of side length 15 feet (4.6 m).  This was followed about fifteen years later by a separate two-story log structure approximately 10 feet to the west of the first structure.  Eventually these separate structures were connected, and the first section was increased to a full two stories.  Around 1813, the last addition to the tavern was added along the entire length of the northern side of the structure and was constructed from sandstone.  The building has twin 32-foot (9.8 m) chimneys on both ends, which is considered an unusual feature in the area.  A veranda spans the full length of the building's front side.Although the exact date when the structure became a tavern is uncertain, it is believed to have become such gradually and at an early date.  The tavern room was 18 feet (5.5 m) by 24 feet (7.3 m) in dimension, which was exceptionally large for tavern rooms of that era.  The tavern was located approximately halfway between Martinsburg and what is now known as Berkeley Springs.  This led to the property being referred to as the Halfway House.  The tavern lasted until 1847, when James Snodgrass, who refused to sell liquor (causing business to dwindle), began renting out the tavern and eventually sold it.  The building became a private residence, in which state it remains.The tavern received several notable visitors throughout its existence.  George Washington visited the tavern on multiple occasions.  The first visit occurred in 1750, when Washington was surveying land for Lord Fairfax.  Another visit was recorded in Washington's diary on September 5, 1784. Washington also stopped at Snodgrass when traveling to Berkeley Springs (also known as Bath) on other occasions.  Noted politician Henry Clay visited Snodgrass Tavern while visiting friends in the area during July 1827, at which time he was the U.S. Secretary of State.The tavern was originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 1973.  On March 22, 2006, the property's boundaries were extended from an original area of .27 acres (0.11 ha) (the tavern itself) to 205 acres (83 ha).  This expansion was done to include other historic structures and sites on the property, including a slave cemetery and various outbuildings.  Snodgrass Tavern is one of the oldest buildings still standing in West Virginia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Berkeley County, West Virginia\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCapace, Nancy (1999).

The name Raglan was in honour of Fitzroy James Henry Somerset, First Baron Raglan (1788-1855), first Commander in Chief British Army in Crimea.British occupation began in early January 1856 during a punitive expedition led by Lieutenant John Murray of the Native Police. Murray was tracking down local Aboriginal tribes suspected of involvement in the killing of five people at nearby Mount Larcombe sheep station. With a posse comitatus of around twenty armed and mounted men, including troopers, constables and colonists, Murray surrounded a \"large mob\" of about a hundred Aboriginal people camped on a creek near to where the township of Raglan now stands. At the break of dawn, Murray's group attacked the camp and \"bullets from a score or more carbines wrought death,\" with the those being shot at running \"from side to side in their frantic efforts to escape.\" Only a few escaped and these \"were pursued and either shot or driven into the waters of [Keppel] Bay.\" A participant later wrote that the ammunition they used during the attack had become exhausted and that they had to use their rifles as clubs. Many of the Aboriginal people were killed or terribly wounded but no casualties were recorded amongst Murray's group.The creek where this occurred was named Hourigan's Creek after the man who fired the first shot of the massacre. This shot was at \"a huge savage who [was] seen to get up and stretch himself,\" the rest of the Aboriginal camp still being asleep. The creek is still called Hourigan's Creek and is still used for shooting with the Raglan Target Sports Association complex being located on its banks. An early resident of Raglan recorded that when he first came to the area he noticed that \"the skulls of black warriors...had been made into an ornamental border for a large flower bed in the garden\" of the homestead of Raglan Station.Raglan was established as a pastoral sheep station in 1857 by William Landsborough who held it for several years before selling it on. The allotments for the township of Raglan were first surveyed in 1865.Gold was found in Raglan in 1867. In August 1867 a nugget of gold was found. Described as \"a monster\", it was 16 inches (41 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide, weighing 30 pounds (14 kg) and worth \u00a31,400. There were around 300 gold diggers active at the Raglan goldfield at that time.Raglan Creek Provisional School opened on 4 August 1879, but closed on 31 October 1879. It reopened on 5 March 1883, and was became Raglan Creek State School on 1 January 1909. In 1911 it was renamed Raglan State School. The school closed on 13 December 1996. The school was at 18 Langmorn Street (23.7196\u00b0S 150.8237\u00b0E\ufeff / -23.7196; 150.8237\ufeff (Raglan State School (former))).Langmorn Creek Crossing Provisional School opened on 20 October 1915 but closed circa 31 January 1916. It reopened as Langmorn Provisional School circa January 1926. On 1 January 1931 it became Langmorn State School. It closed on 26 October 1941, but reopened on 26 October 1944.

It was located on or near Hourigan Creek Road (approx 23.7378\u00b0S 150.7829\u00b0E\ufeff / -23.7378; 150.7829\ufeff (Hourigan Creek State School (former))).The Raglan Memorial Hall was built in about 1932 and was used for dances until 1990, after which it stood idle. It was relocated to the Calliope River Historical Village in March 2002 and officially re-opened by George Creed, the mayor of Calliope Shire.In the 2011 census Raglan was included with neighbouring Ambrose and together had a population of 545.In the 2016 census the locality of Raglan had a population of 146 people.\n\n\n== Heritage listings ==\nRaglan has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:\n\nLangmorn  Road (23.8352\u00b0S 150.7544\u00b0E\ufeff / -23.8352; 150.7544\ufeff (Langmorn Homestead)): Langmorn Homestead\nRaglan Station Road (23.7407\u00b0S 150.8448\u00b0E\ufeff / -23.7407; 150.8448\ufeff (Parson's Inn)): Parson's Inn\nRaglan Station Road (23.7328\u00b0S 150.8828\u00b0E\ufeff / -23.7328; 150.8828\ufeff (Raglan Homestead)): Raglan Homestead\n\n\n== Education ==\nThere are no schools in Raglan.

    "Preman (Indonesian gangster)": "A preman is a member of an Indonesian organized gang, encompassing street level criminals up through crime bosses. Premans are often perceived negatively throughout Indonesian society due to associations with violence and criminality. This root word is derived from a term which describes the \"confluence of state power and criminality\". However, organized crime in Indonesia has a more enduring and complicated history, as the confluence of crime syndicates with perceived legitimate political authority has a history extending as far back as the Medang Kingdom. While associated with brigandage and theft, Indonesian crime syndicates have periodically acted as enforcers to maintain authority and order. The roles of the jago or jawara were particularly important during the Indonesian Revolution, as they often adopted political roles that helped consolidating the power of local authorities. Despite their significance to Indonesian history, syndicates are universally marginalized due to associations with violence and social illegitimacy.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word jago literally means a rooster and refers to a type of strongman that exists as a part of the everyday life in urban and rural areas of Indonesia. The jago is a social and political actor in both recent and more distant history of Indonesia. In Indonesian popular culture, the jago is often romanticized as a champion of the people whose acts of violence are motivated by a deep sense of justice, honour and order.The preman is the modern, diagonally opposite form of the jago. This word originated from the Dutch word vrijman (free man) showing the roots of the social group during the Dutch colonial era; as Loren Ryter states, \"the ambiguity of the term is best understood by thinking of the preman as a kind of privateer, an interpretation true to the colonial roots of the term vrijman, or free man. [...] a vrijman was not a freed slave, but rather a non-contract overseer or a coolie day-laborer, thus still in the employ of the company, though not legally bound to it.\"\n\n\n== Biographies of notable figures ==\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-colonial ===\nIn the traditional state of the Medang (Mataram) Kingdom, thuggery was very much part of rural Java. The jago in pre-colonial times gained their legitimacy through their physical strength and sense of justice. In contrast, preman are notorious for their bullying behavior.:\u200a340\u200a Due to their image as thugs, the preman in rural Java were very much despised by the locals, while Jago were highly praised as heroes.\n\n\n=== Colonial period ===\n\n\n==== Role in Batavian society and to colonial state ====\nWhen the Dutch first arrived, their colonization did little to disturb the position of the preman. However, in the 19th century, their role shifted with the advent of a bureaucratically organised government.:\u200a77\u200a The differences between the more bureaucratic and legalistic Dutch colonial state and the traditional agrarian Java state that relies heavily on personal relation called for the need of intermediaries or power-brokers. These power-brokers were also referred to as premans who acted as agents between the ruling elite and the peasantry. The preman hence became an integral part of the colonial power structure.:\u200a327\u200a Although the colonial administration was based in Batavia, they had little control over the rural heartland of Java. It was through this need for control that the preman became part of the administration. Subsequently, we see the preman getting involved in the fields of taxation corv\u00e9e, conscription as well as enforcing order. Hence, it can be said that the underworld enjoyed \"an almost symbiotic relationship with the forces of law and order\".:\u200a15\u200a In a society that is based almost entirely upon trade, labour bosses as well as preman enforcers were important to the economic life of the city.\nSuch needs for the preman to act as intermediaries were further enforced by the egalitarian nature of Javanese society, which was reinforced by the mystical concept of power that prevented outright confrontation between the people in power and the peasantry.:\u200a336\u200a The preman, as intermediaries, were important in filling in the ideological gap between cultural ideals and the political realities of the governing society. The different ideals and realities of the peasants' life demanded a more active leadership, though a misleading one, because the priyayi class could not provide.:\u200a337\u2013339\u200a\n\n\n==== Rebellions against the Dutch ====\nDespite their incorporation in the colonial administration, this incorporation was not without disruption. Due to its volatile nature, the preman bands often emerged as sites of rebellion such as in the Banten peasant uprising in 1888. The preman were also seen as a threat to the Dutch authorities due to their status as being \"magically invulnerable\" against Dutch authority including bullets and sharp weapons.:\u200a328\u200a Many of these rebellions and unrest occurring in Jakarta's region had a broadly millenarian character. These rebellions \"sought to realize a fundamental, spiritually-based change in the ordering of the world and they looked to a leader with allegedly supernatural characteristics\".:\u200a24\u200a The preman were also seen as qualified to participate in the rebellions by virtue of their skills. In a colonial regime whereby many of the indigenous population had already been disarmed, the preman were the only ones who possessed the skills to use offensive weapons necessary for a credible revolt. This was further enhanced by their supernatural skills that render them invulnerable from physical attacks.\n\n\n==== Rising political awareness ====\n\nIn the early twentieth century, the increasing effectiveness of Dutch repression had caused frustration amongst the Batavia's underworld. This frustration caused them to gain an interest in the emerging Indonesian nationalist movement.:\u200a20\u200a The establishment of Sarekat Islam (Islam Union) in the Batavia Ommelanden in 1913 saw the involvement of Jakarta's underworld. In the organization against the Chinese landlords and their agents, Sarekat Islam acquired its own access of thuggery through the recruitment of local jago.:\u200a30\u200a:\u200a163\u20134,\u200a167\u200a The underworld's political awareness further enhanced by the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI). Through their contacts with the workers and efforts to establish trade unions in Batavia, it brought the PKI into contact with Jakarta's underworld. The local gangs were assets to the PKI as they provided the organizational base that gave its local branches access to networks of support, information and protection.:\u200a30\u200a They also provided the PKI with enthusiastic supporters who added to the burning national fervor and will not easily cower under the colonial authorities. :\u200a31\u200aAfter 1923, with the shifting of the PKI's headquarters from Semarang to Batavia and Tanjung Priok this saw the involvement of Bantenese jagos who were also known as jawara. These gangsters provided the underworld with the means to protect itself from other local jagos as well as against any local officials or Islamic leaders who threaten the position of the PKI.:\u200a31\u200a:\u200a95\u200a For the gangs, the PKI portrayed itself as an attractive political force that was capable of being a challenger against the Dutch. They were also in need of allies given the increasing repression of the Dutch against them. The Dutch used the Korps Marechaussee and the Veldpolitie (Rural Police) restricted the movements of the Jakarta's underworld. Hence, the jago leaders gained interest in the possibility of increasing their position through supporting possible challengers to the colonial system.:\u200a31\u201332\u200a This alliance saw the emergence of the anti-colonial movement in 1926 whereby an attack on the jails at Glodok and Cipinang were carried out. However, the attack failed and Dutch repression was effective in crippling the Batavia PKI and in driving the city's gangs back into the underworld. Nevertheless, participation in the revolt had planted a revolutionary consciousness in the gangs. By the late 1930s, the underworld was once again involved in the activities of the Gerindo (Gerakan Rakyat Indonesia, Indonesian People's Movement). The need to keep in touch with the masses made the Jakarta's underworld an attractive partner as they helped in ensuring the popular credentials of the nationalist leaders.:\u200a33\u201335\u200a\n\n\n=== Japanese occupation ===\nThe Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies gave the Jakarta underworld opportunities offered by the major political change. Just like the Dutch, the Japanese had no intentions to challenge the position of the underworld. The powerful jagos were still recruited for guerrilla warfare against expected Allied invasions. The gangsters on the other hand, were more than happy to accept the status and implied protection brought by the Japanese.:\u200a41\u200a\n\nHowever, the underworld's position was challenged indirectly by the Japanese's construction of a rival institution in the form of Pembela Tanah Air (PETA). As the PETA was well-armed and trained, they had the potential to challenge the power of the local gangs. The Jakarta underworld however, gained power again when the latter part of the Japanese occupation resulted in economic hardships. The policy of economic autarky imposed by the Japanese had resulted in an inflation of the market price of rice. The local jagos of Karawang and Jakarta, on the other hand, were able to evade these regulations due to their wide networks and connections. Through this situation, they sought to gain profits, which in turn strengthened their political positions.:\u200a42\u200aIn addition to that the Japanese occupation also established close relationship between the underworld and the younger generation of nationalists. This became the basis for the subsequent revolutionary coalition in 1945 onwards. Under the Japanese occupation, the alliance between the underworld and the nationalists received its first institutional form.:\u200a43\u200a This alliance was based not only on historical experience of cooperation between the two sides but also on their shared antagonism to the Dutch and their complementary skills. The nationalists possessed an analysis, a programme and a broad scope of action which made effective resistance seem more possible while the jagos possessed the organizational base needed by the nationalists for mass mobilization.\n\n\n=== Revolutionary period ===\n\nThe Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945. Chaos soon ensued as older nationalists and younger nationalists were at odds with one another in deciding on the correct strategy to be taken in the new situation. The latter pressed for a bold declaration of independence. In this period of unrest, a political programme came from the jagos who wanted \"a congenial political order\".:\u200a51\u200a The local breakdown of public order had given the jagos a chance to expand their power bases, but they needed to protect their positions from interlopers who might emerge during the unrest. The jagos gangs who moved into this new power vacuum were those who tied their personal ambitions to the establishment of the Republic. They also adopted the rhetoric and the substance of nationalist demands. A declaration of allegiance to the Republic immediately reinforced a jagos's authority by the power of association. This allegiance also provided the jagos with opportunities to position themselves in the lower levels of government hierarchy in the countryside. Hence, we see many small-time jagos assuming local titles.\nThe better-established local jagos, however, created their own institutions, which overrides the official hierarchy and allowed them better control of it. These larger jagos included Haji Darip, boss of Klender.With the declaration of independence and the involvement of the local bosses in the Republican cause, it had defined the enemy and made the distinction between the nationalist jagos and the opportunists. Local jagos like Darip and Macem acquired an image as nationalist gangsters and this allowed them to move into a position of greater power and responsibility. They were also more aware that their fate to stay in power was tied to the Republic. However, these local jagos found difficulties in understanding the nationalist leaders' calls for calm and restraint. Similarly, the young nationalists were also frustrated with the older leaders' caution and hesitancy to propagate direct confrontation. This caused them to go back into the kampungs of Jakarta to re-establish their contacts with the underworld. Through BARA (Barisan Rakyat, People's Brigade), they worked with the local jagos. The local jagos were informed of the aims of the revolution and they were encouraged to enrol their followers as a unit in BARA.:\u200a54\u200aBesides BARA, the Jakarta underworld were also a part of the API (Angkatan Pemuda Indonesia, Youth Generation of Indonesia) constituency. The leaders of the API had personal links to the underworld because of their prior pre-war contacts and the Japanese-sponsored training programme. The local jagos were important as they provided 'ready-made' organizations and access to weapons. Likewise, the local jagos such as Imam Syafe'i from Senen found the API a convenient instrument to further their personal and political ambitions.:\u200a61\u200a Both parties appropriated each other for their own benefits as well as to cover up their weaknesses. The formation of the LRJR (Lasykar Rakyat Jakarta Raya, People's Militia of Greater Jakarta) once again saw their collaboration with the local jagos like Haji Darip, Pak Macem and Kyai Haji Nurali who were considered to be considerably patriotic. Local jago, Haji Darip, was considered more attractive as an ally for possessing a consignment of weapons from the East Javanese leader, Dr Moestopo.:\u200a75\u200a By mid-1946, the Jakarta underworld had greatly expanded its following through the revolution.\n\n\n=== Post-Revolution ===\n\n\n==== Decline of Jakarta's underworld ====\nIn post-revolution Indonesia, the lasykar's inability to secure a place in the Republican state saw its decline in power. The Republican state grew increasingly hostile towards the underworld due to its emerging strategic vision that seeks to reduce international hostility by modifying its nationalist programme so that it would be more acceptable to the great powers. The lasykar's and local jagos' decline can be accounted for by the following reasons:\n\nIncreasing mutual distrust amongst the lasykar due to the smuggling trade\u2013 A result of the tradition of local jagos who were naturally distrustful of one another; this hampered cooperation between nationalist groups :\u200a88\u200aInability to make themselves militarily useful to the Republic\nThe rise of the Indonesian army who was increasingly developing an expertise in the military area, hence replacing the lasykar\nFailure of the local jagos to capitalize on their illegality; inability to find new opportunities for lucrative criminality in the revolutionary environment\u2013 Due to their lack of a lucrative commodity for trade such as illegal drugs or alcohol:\u200a96\u200aWeak structures within the organization of the local jago gangs:\u200a95\u200a\nIncreasing tension and hostility between the Indonesian army and the lasykar:\u200a102\u200a\n\n\n==== HAMOT (Hare Majesteit's Ongeregelde Tropen, Her Majesty's Irregular Troop) ====\n\nAs opportunities within the local government declined, many local bosses turned to the service of the local Dutch. Local bosses such as Panji, Fakhruddin, Harun Umar and Sujono took up service under the Dutch auxiliary force. Under the pressure of the Dutch attacks, Panji, the son-in-law of infamous local boss, Haji Darip, became part of HAMOT (Hare Majesteit's Ongeregelde Tropen, Her Majesty's Irregular Troop).:\u200a143\u200a This new unit was an initiative by Lt.-Kol Bavnick as an attempt to use the lasykar for intelligence purposes and as auxiliary soldiers.\nSubsequently, the Dutch military continued to take on actions to break up the lasykar. This saw small units of the lasykar who had taken some allegiance to the Bambu Runcing Division through the SP88 to take up the characteristics of pre-war gangs. These small units took up names such as Pasukan Siluman (Ghost Squad), Srigala Hitam (Black Jackal), Pemotong Leher (Neck Cutters) and Garuda Putih (White Eagle). Despite continuous Dutch attempts at eliminating the groups, units such as the SP88 were relatively successful in their psychological warfare against the Dutch. This war of ideas (perang pikiran) was aimed at keeping the Dutch unbalance by constantly changing their names and organisations. They also used the tactic of intimidation by spreading posters bearing the following words:\n\nThis guerrilla warfare, although successful only in preventing the Dutch administration re-establishment n the region, faced the problem of choosing a framework for their struggle. This was further worsened by the hostility from the Republic due to their refusal to evacuate.\nThe Jakarta's underworld disintegrated after the dissolution of the 17 August Division. Only a few of the lasykar's members continued to survive as they 'returned to society' (kembali ke masyarakat). These survivors either took up their old criminal activities or became engaged in new occupations. While some continued on with a political career, others under the HAMOT had continued on to the part of security battalions under Dutch set up.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\nIn post-independence Indonesia, premans have more recently attained a new stature in the urban centers. Fractious local politics, inadequate law enforcement, and the driving forces of poverty and unemployment have transformed post-Suharto Indonesia into a \"preman's paradise.\" Premans now can be found in both street corner gangs and in mass organisations with thousands of members whereby their leaders often have close connections with the political elites. They ensured a kind of social order that is centered on the maintenance of a local territorial protection regime.:\u200a10\u200a:\u200a199\u200a\n\n\n==== New Order ====\nIn the New Order period 1966-98, the jago became increasingly known as preman. These new premans had a symbiotic relationship with the elements of the regime.:\u200a192\u2013193\u200a Premans were also associated to political thuggery:\u200a199\u200a whereby several youth gangs and local thugs were employed by the military as a part of the bloody anti-communist purges.:\u200a10\u200a These premans was also known as gali (gabungan anak liar, gangs of wild children) who became an important part of the repressive strategies pursued by the state.:\u200a202\u200a These local premans were employed as provocateurs by figures such as Ali Murtopo, the head of Special Operations (Operasi Khusus, Opsus) during the Malari riots in Jakarta. Similar to their situation during the revolution, this period had brought profound benefits to the premans by making use of the disorder of the 'new order' to their advantage. Subsequently, these gangs were disbanded by General Soemitro as an effort to regulate them.:\u200a11\u200a This was because the gangs were seen as increasingly threatening the position of the state and its political actors. The period of petrus, however, saw the execution of many premans and galis. The aftermath of petrus saw an increasing number of thugs and gangsters joining the different nationalist and youth organizations like Pemuda Pancasila. This action was prompted out of fear as they realized the need for state back-up to ensure their survival.:\u200a202\u200a\n\n\n==== Post-New Order ====\nUnder Habibie, as defense of the state was correlated with defense of Islam, the groups acted as a state-sponsored bulwark against the demands of the student-based reform movement.:\u200a193\u200a The local preman organizations became institutionalized as part of the democratic process whereby they started to form their own political parties.:\u200a200\u200a However, there was also a split in the new breed of preman organizations. While organizations such as the Patriot Party (Pemuda Pancasila) continue to portray themselves as defenders of national unity, the new breed organized themselves along post-Pancasila ethnic and religious lines.:\u200a193\u200a This new breed includes the Betawi Brotherhood Forum and Front Pembela Islam. Local preman groups preferred to be affiliated to bigger group such as the above that have already established a name for themselves. This allowed for them to \"ride on the tails of other jagos' success\".:\u200a13\u200a Being associated to larger groups also means better political affiliation as well as power.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOrganised Crime in Indonesia\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAspinall, Edward (2010).

Cornwall forms the westernmost part of the South West Peninsula of the island of Great Britain. The southwesternmost point is Land's End and the southernmost Lizard Point. Cornwall has a population of 568,210 and an area of 3,563 km2 (1,376 sq mi). The county has been administered since 2009 by the unitary authority, Cornwall Council. The ceremonial county of Cornwall also includes the Isles of Scilly, which are administered separately. The administrative centre of Cornwall is Truro, its only city.\nCornwall was formerly a Brythonic kingdom and subsequently a royal duchy. It is the cultural and ethnic origin of the Cornish diaspora. The Cornish nationalist movement contests the present constitutional status of Cornwall and seeks greater autonomy within the United Kingdom in the form of a devolved legislative Cornish Assembly with powers similar to those in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In 2014, Cornish people were granted minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, giving them recognition as a distinct ethnic group.Recent discoveries of Roman remains in Cornwall indicate a greater Roman presence there than once thought. After the collapse of the Roman Empire, Cornwall (along with Devon, parts of Dorset and Somerset, and the Scilly Isles) was a part of the Brittonic kingdom of Dumnonia, ruled by chieftains of the Cornovii who may have included figures regarded as semi-historical or legendary, such as King Mark of Cornwall and King Arthur, evidenced by folklore traditions derived from the Historia Regum Britanniae. The Cornovii division of the Dumnonii tribe were separated from their fellow Brythons of Wales after the Battle of Deorham in 577 AD, and often came into conflict with the expanding English kingdom of Wessex. The regions of Dumnonia outside of Cornwall (and Dartmoor) had been annexed by the English by 838 AD. King Athelstan in 936 AD set the boundary between the English and Cornish at the high water mark of the eastern bank of the River Tamar. From the Early Middle Ages, language and culture were shared by Brythons trading across both sides of the Channel, resulting in the corresponding high medieval Breton kingdoms of Domnon\u00e9e and Cornouaille and the Celtic Christianity common to both areas.\nTin mining was important in the Cornish economy from the High Middle Ages, and expanded greatly in the 19th century when rich copper mines were also in production. In the mid-19th century, tin and copper mines entered a period of decline and china clay extraction became more important. Mining had virtually ended by the 1990s. Fishing and agriculture were the other important sectors of the economy, but railways led to a growth of tourism in the 20th century after the decline of the mining and fishing industries. Since the late 2010s there have been hopes of a resurgence of mining in Cornwall after the discovery of 'globally significant' deposits of lithium to help power the electric car revolution.Cornwall is noted for its geology and coastal scenery. A large part of the Cornubian batholith is within Cornwall. The north coast has many cliffs where exposed geological formations are studied. The area is noted for its wild moorland landscapes, its long and varied coastline, its attractive villages, its many place-names derived from the Cornish language, and its very mild climate. Extensive stretches of Cornwall's coastline, and Bodmin Moor, are protected as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.\n\n\n== Name and emblems ==\n\nThe modern English name Cornwall is a compound of two ancient demonyms coming from two different language groups:\n\nCorn- originates from the Proto-Celtic \"*karnos\" (\"horn\" or \"headland\") is cognate with the English word \"horn\" (both deriving from the Proto-Indo-European *ker-). An Iron Age Celtic tribe that occupied the Cornish peninsula, the Cornovii (\"peninsula people\") may have also existed.\n-wall derives from the Old English exonym \"wealh\", meaning \"foreigner\" or \"Romanized Celt\" (i.e. a Welsh person).In the Cornish language, Cornwall is Kernow which stems from the same Proto-Celtic root.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory, Roman and post-Roman periods ===\n\nHumans reoccupied Britain after the last Ice Age. The area now known as Cornwall was first inhabited in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic periods. It continued to be occupied by Neolithic and then by Bronze-Age people.\nAccording to John T. Koch and others, Cornwall in the Late Bronze Age formed part of a maritime trading-networked culture which researchers have dubbed the Atlantic Bronze Age and which extended over the areas of present-day Ireland, England, Wales, France, Spain, and Portugal.During the British Iron Age, Cornwall, like all of Britain (modern England, Scotland, Wales, and the Isle of Man), was inhabited by a Celtic people known as the Britons with distinctive cultural relations to neighbouring Brittany. The Common Brittonic spoken at the time eventually developed into several distinct tongues, including Cornish, Welsh, Breton, Cumbric and Pictish.The first written account of Cornwall comes from the 1st-century BC Sicilian Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the 4th-century BCE geographer Pytheas, who had sailed to Britain:\n\nThe inhabitants of that part of Britain called Belerion (or Land's End) from their intercourse with foreign merchants, are civilised in their manner of life. They prepare the tin, working very carefully the earth in which it is produced ... Here then the merchants buy the tin from the natives and carry it over to Gaul, and after travelling overland for about thirty days, they finally bring their loads on horses to the mouth of the Rh\u00f4ne.\n\nThe identity of these merchants is unknown. It has been theorised that they were Phoenicians, but there is no evidence for this. Professor Timothy Champion, discussing Diodorus Siculus's comments on the tin trade, states that \"Diodorus never actually says that the Phoenicians sailed to Cornwall. In fact, he says quite the opposite: the production of Cornish tin was in the hands of the natives of Cornwall, and its transport to the Mediterranean was organised by local merchants, by sea and then over land through France, passing through areas well outside Phoenician control.\" Isotopic evidence suggests that tin ingots found off the coast of Haifa, Israel, came from Cornwall. Tin, required for the production of bronze, was a relatively rare and precious commodity in the Bronze Age - hence the interest shown in Devon and Cornwall's tin resources. (For further discussion of tin mining see the section on the economy below.)\nIn the first four centuries CE, during the time of Roman dominance in Britain, Cornwall was rather remote from the main centres of Romanisation - the nearest being Isca Dumnoniorum, modern day Exeter. However, the Roman road-system extended into Cornwall with four significant Roman sites based on forts: Tregear near Nanstallon was discovered in the early 1970s, two others were found at Restormel Castle, Lostwithiel in 2007, and a third fort near Calstock was also discovered early in 2007. In addition, a Roman-style villa was found at Magor Farm, Illogan in 1935. However, after 410 CE, Cornwall appears to have reverted to rule by Romano-Celtic chieftains of the Cornovii tribe as part of the Brittonic kingdom of Dumnonia (which also included present-day Devonshire and the Scilly Isles), including the territory of one Marcus Cunomorus, with at least one significant power base at Tintagel in the early 6th century.\n\"King\" Mark of Cornwall is a semi-historical figure known from Welsh literature, from the Matter of Britain, and, in particular, from the later Norman-Breton medieval romance of Tristan and Yseult, where he appears as a close relative of King Arthur, himself usually considered to be born of the Cornish people in folklore traditions derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth's 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae.\nArchaeology supports ecclesiastical, literary and legendary evidence for some relative economic stability and close cultural ties between the sub-Roman Westcountry, South Wales, Brittany, the Channel Islands, and Ireland through the fifth and sixth centuries.\n\n\n=== Conflict with Wessex ===\nThe Battle of Deorham in 577 saw the separation of Dumnonia (and therefore Cornwall) from Wales, following which the Dumnonii often came into conflict with the expanding English kingdom of Wessex. The Annales Cambriae report that in 722 AD the Britons of Cornwall won a battle at \"Hehil\". It seems likely that the enemy the Cornish fought was a West Saxon force, as evidenced by the naming of King Ine of Wessex and his kinsman Nonna in reference to an earlier Battle of Lining in 710.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle stated in 815 (adjusted date) \"and in this year king Ecgbryht raided in Cornwall from east to west.\" and thenceforth apparently held it as a ducatus or dukedom annexed to his regnum or kingdom of Wessex, but not wholly incorporated with it. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle states that in 825 (adjusted date) a battle took place between the Wealas (Cornish) and the Defnas (men of Devon) at Gafulforda. In the same year Ecgbert, as a later document expresses it, \"disposed of their territory as it seemed fit to him, giving a tenth part of it to God.\" In other words, he incorporated Cornwall ecclesiastically with the West Saxon diocese of Sherborne, and endowed Eahlstan, his fighting bishop, who took part in the campaign, with an extensive Cornish estate consisting of Callington and Lawhitton, both in the Tamar valley, and Pawton near Padstow.\nIn 838, the Cornish and their Danish allies were defeated by Egbert in the Battle of Hingston Down at Hengestesdune (probably Hingston Down in Cornwall). In 875, the last recorded king of Cornwall, Dumgarth, is said to have drowned. Around the 880s, Anglo-Saxons from Wessex had established modest land holdings in the eastern part of Cornwall; notably Alfred the Great who had acquired a few estates. William of Malmesbury, writing around 1120, says that King Athelstan of England (924\u2013939) fixed the boundary between English and Cornish people at the east bank of the River Tamar.\n\n\n=== Breton\u2013Norman period ===\n\nOne interpretation of the Domesday Book is that by this time the native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, particularly Harold Godwinson himself. However, the Bodmin manumissions show that two leading Cornish figures nominally had Saxon names, but these were both glossed with native Cornish names. In 1068 Brian of Brittany may have been created Earl of Cornwall, and naming evidence cited by medievalist Edith Ditmas suggests that many other post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans, the Bretons being descended from Britons who had fled to what is today Brittany during the early years of the Anglo-Saxon conquest. She also proposed this period for the early composition of the Tristan and Iseult cycle by poets such as B\u00e9roul from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition.Soon after the Norman conquest most of the land was transferred to the new Breton\u2013Norman aristocracy, with the lion's share going to Robert, Count of Mortain, half-brother of King William and the largest landholder in England after the king with his stronghold at Trematon Castle near the mouth of the Tamar.\n\n\n=== Later medieval administration and society ===\nSubsequently, however, Norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new Cornish-Norman ruling class including scholars such as Richard Rufus of Cornwall. These families eventually became the new rulers of Cornwall, typically speaking Norman French, Breton-Cornish, Latin, and eventually English, with many becoming involved in the operation of the Stannary Parliament system, the Earldom and eventually the Duchy of Cornwall. The Cornish language continued to be spoken and acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from Breton.\n\n\n==== Stannary parliaments ====\n\nThe stannary parliaments and stannary courts were legislative and legal institutions in Cornwall and in Devon (in the Dartmoor area). The stannary courts administered equity for the region's tin-miners and tin mining interests, and they were also courts of record for the towns dependent on the mines. The separate and powerful government institutions available to the tin miners reflected the enormous importance of the tin industry to the English economy during the Middle Ages. Special laws for tin miners pre-date written legal codes in Britain, and ancient traditions exempted everyone connected with tin mining in Cornwall and Devon from any jurisdiction other than the stannary courts in all but the most exceptional circumstances.\n\n\n==== Piracy and smuggling ====\nCornish piracy was active during the Elizabethan era on the west coast of Britain. Cornwall is well known for its wreckers who preyed on ships passing Cornwall's rocky coastline. During the 17th and 18th centuries Cornwall was a major smuggling area.\n\n\n=== Heraldry ===\n\nIn later times, Cornwall was known to the Anglo-Saxons as \"West Wales\" to distinguish it from \"North Wales\" (the modern nation of Wales). The name appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle in 891 as On Corn walum. In the Domesday Book it was referred to as Cornualia and in c. 1198 as Cornwal. Other names for the county include a latinisation of the name as Cornubia (first appears in a mid-9th-century deed purporting to be a copy of one dating from c. 705), and as Cornugallia in 1086.\n\n\n== Physical geography ==\n\nCornwall forms the tip of the south-west peninsula of the island of Great Britain, and is therefore exposed to the full force of the prevailing winds that blow in from the Atlantic Ocean. The coastline is composed mainly of resistant rocks that give rise in many places to tall cliffs. Cornwall has a border with only one other county, Devon, which is formed almost entirely by the River Tamar, and the remainder (to the north) by the Marsland Valley.\n\n\n=== Coastal areas ===\nThe north and south coasts have different characteristics. The north coast on the Celtic Sea, part of the Atlantic Ocean, is more exposed and therefore has a wilder nature. The prosaically named High Cliff, between Boscastle and St Gennys, is the highest sheer-drop cliff in Cornwall at 223 metres (732 ft). However, there are also many extensive stretches of fine golden sand which form the beaches important to the tourist industry, such as those at Bude, Polzeath, Watergate Bay, Perranporth, Porthtowan, Fistral Beach, Newquay, St Agnes, St Ives, and on the south coast Gyllyngvase beach in Falmouth and the large beach at Praa Sands further to the south-west. There are two river estuaries on the north coast: Hayle Estuary and the estuary of the River Camel, which provides Padstow and Rock with a safe harbour. The seaside town of Newlyn is a popular holiday destination, as it is one of the last remaining traditional Cornish fishing ports, with views reaching over Mount's Bay.\n\nThe south coast, dubbed the \"Cornish Riviera\", is more sheltered and there are several broad estuaries offering safe anchorages, such as at Falmouth and Fowey. Beaches on the south coast usually consist of coarser sand and shingle, interspersed with rocky sections of wave-cut platform. Also on the south coast, the picturesque fishing village of Polperro, at the mouth of the Pol River, and the fishing port of Looe on the River Looe are both popular with tourists.\n\n\n=== Inland areas ===\nThe interior of the county consists of a roughly east\u2013west spine of infertile and exposed upland, with a series of granite intrusions, such as Bodmin Moor, which contains the highest land within Cornwall. From east to west, and with approximately descending altitude, these are Bodmin Moor, Hensbarrow north of St Austell, Carnmenellis to the south of Camborne, and the Penwith or Land's End peninsula. These intrusions are the central part of the granite outcrops that form the exposed parts of the Cornubian batholith of south-west Britain, which also includes Dartmoor to the east in Devon and the Isles of Scilly to the west, the latter now being partially submerged.\n\nThe intrusion of the granite into the surrounding sedimentary rocks gave rise to extensive metamorphism and mineralisation, and this led to Cornwall being one of the most important mining areas in Europe until the early 20th century. It is thought tin was mined here as early as the Bronze Age, and copper, lead, zinc and silver have all been mined in Cornwall. Alteration of the granite also gave rise to extensive deposits of China Clay, especially in the area to the north of St Austell, and the extraction of this remains an important industry.\nThe uplands are surrounded by more fertile, mainly pastoral farmland. Near the south coast, deep wooded valleys provide sheltered conditions for flora that like shade and a moist, mild climate. These areas lie mainly on Devonian sandstone and slate. The north east of Cornwall lies on Carboniferous rocks known as the Culm Measures. In places these have been subjected to severe folding, as can be seen on the north coast near Crackington Haven and in several other locations.\n\n\n=== Lizard Peninsula ===\n\nThe geology of the Lizard peninsula is unusual, in that it is mainland Britain's only example of an ophiolite, a section of oceanic crust now found on land. Much of the peninsula consists of the dark green and red Precambrian serpentinite, which forms spectacular cliffs, notably at Kynance Cove, and carved and polished serpentine ornaments are sold in local gift shops. This ultramafic rock also forms a very infertile soil which covers the flat and marshy heaths of the interior of the peninsula. This is home to rare plants, such as the Cornish Heath, which has been adopted as the county flower.\n\n\n=== Hills and high points ===\n\n\n== Settlements and transport ==\n\nCornwall's only city, and the home of the council headquarters, is Truro. Nearby Falmouth is notable as a port. St Just in Penwith is the westernmost town in England, though the same claim has been made for Penzance, which is larger. St Ives and Padstow are today small vessel ports with a major tourism and leisure sector in their economies. Newquay on the north coast is another major urban settlement which is known for its beaches and is a popular surfing destination, as is Bude further north, but Newquay is now also becoming important for its aviation-related industries. Camborne is the county's largest town and more populous than the capital Truro. Together with the neighbouring town of Redruth, it forms the largest urban area in Cornwall, and both towns were significant as centres of the global tin mining industry in the 19th century; nearby copper mines were also very productive during that period. St Austell is also larger than Truro and was the centre of the china clay industry in Cornwall. Until four new parishes were created for the St Austell area on 1 April 2009 St Austell was the largest settlement in Cornwall.Cornwall borders the county of Devon at the River Tamar. Major roads between Cornwall and the rest of Great Britain are the A38 which crosses the Tamar at Plymouth via the Tamar Bridge and the town of Saltash, the A39 road (Atlantic Highway) from Barnstaple, passing through North Cornwall to end in Falmouth, and the A30 which connects Cornwall to the M5 motorway at Exeter, crosses the border south of Launceston, crosses Bodmin Moor and connects Bodmin, Truro, Redruth, Camborne, Hayle and Penzance. Torpoint Ferry links Plymouth with Torpoint on the opposite side of the Hamoaze. A rail bridge, the Royal Albert Bridge built by Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1859), provides the other main land transport link. The city of Plymouth, a large urban centre in south west Devon, is an important location for services such as hospitals, department stores, road and rail transport, and cultural venues, particularly for people living in east Cornwall.\nCardiff and Swansea, across the Bristol Channel, have at some times in the past been connected to Cornwall by ferry, but these do not operate now.The Isles of Scilly are served by ferry (from Penzance) and by aeroplane, having its own airport: St Mary's Airport. There are regular flights between St Mary's and Land's End Airport, near St Just, and Newquay Airport; during the summer season, a service is also provided between St Mary's and Exeter Airport, in Devon.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\n\nCornwall has varied habitats including terrestrial and marine ecosystems. One noted species in decline locally is the Reindeer lichen, which species has been made a priority for protection under the national UK Biodiversity Action Plan.\n\nBotanists divide Cornwall and Scilly into two vice-counties: West (1) and East (2). The standard flora is by F. H. Davey Flora of Cornwall (1909). Davey was assisted by A. O. Hume and he thanks Hume, his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for help in the compilation of that Flora, publication of which was financed by him.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nCornwall has a temperate Oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfb), with mild winters and cool summers. Cornwall has the mildest and one of the sunniest climates of the United Kingdom, as a result of its oceanic setting and the influence of the Gulf Stream. The average annual temperature in Cornwall ranges from 11.6 \u00b0C (52.9 \u00b0F) on the Isles of Scilly to 9.8 \u00b0C (49.6 \u00b0F) in the central uplands. Winters are among the warmest in the country due to the moderating effects of the warm ocean currents, and frost and snow are very rare at the coast and are also rare in the central upland areas. Summers are, however, not as warm as in other parts of southern England. The surrounding sea and its southwesterly position mean that Cornwall's weather can be relatively changeable.\nCornwall is one of the sunniest areas in the UK. It has more than 1,541 hours of sunshine per year, with the highest average of 7.6 hours of sunshine per day in July. The moist, mild air coming from the southwest brings higher amounts of rainfall than in eastern Great Britain, at 1,051 to 1,290 mm (41.4 to 50.8 in) per year. However, this is not as much as in more northern areas of the west coast. The Isles of Scilly, for example, where there are on average fewer than two days of air frost per year, is the only area in the UK to be in the Hardiness zone 10. The islands have, on average, less than one day of air temperature exceeding 30 \u00b0C per year and are in the AHS Heat Zone 1. Extreme temperatures in Cornwall are particularly rare; however, extreme weather in the form of storms and floods is common.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\n\n\n==== Cornish language ====\n\n \nCornish, a member of the Brythonic branch of the Celtic language family, is a revived language that died out as a first language in the late 18th century. It is closely related to the other Brythonic languages, Breton and Welsh, and less so to the Goidelic languages.  Cornish has no legal status in the UK.\nThere has been a revival of the language by academics and optimistic enthusiasts since the mid-19th century that gained momentum from the publication in 1904 of Henry Jenner's Handbook of the Cornish Language. It is a social networking community language rather than a social community group language. Cornwall Council encourages and facilitates language classes within the county, in schools and within the wider community.In 2002, Cornish was named as a UK regional language in the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. As a result, in 2005 its promoters received limited government funding. Several words originating in Cornish are used in the mining terminology of English, such as costean, gossan, gunnies, kibbal, kieve and vug.\n\n\n==== English dialect ====\n\nThe Cornish language and culture influenced the emergence of particular pronunciations and grammar not used elsewhere in England. The Cornish dialect is spoken to varying degrees; however, someone speaking in broad Cornish may be practically unintelligible to one not accustomed to it. Cornish dialect has generally declined, as in most places it is now little more than a regional accent and grammatical differences have been eroded over time. Marked differences in vocabulary and usage still exist between the eastern and western parts of Cornwall.\n\n\n=== Flag ===\n\nSaint Piran's Flag is the national flag and ancient banner of Cornwall, and an emblem of the Cornish people. It is regarded as the county flag by Cornwall Council. The banner of Saint Piran is a white cross on a black background (in terms of heraldry 'sable, a cross argent'). According to legend Saint Piran adopted these colours from seeing the white tin in the black coals and ashes during his discovery of tin. The Cornish flag is an exact reverse of the former Breton black cross national flag and is known by the same name \"Kroaz Du\".\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nSince the 19th century, Cornwall, with its unspoilt maritime scenery and strong light, has sustained a vibrant visual art scene of international renown. Artistic activity within Cornwall was initially centred on the art-colony of Newlyn, most active at the turn of the 20th century. This Newlyn School is associated with the names of Stanhope Forbes, Elizabeth Forbes, Norman Garstin and Lamorna Birch. Modernist writers such as D. H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf lived in Cornwall between the wars, and Ben Nicholson, the painter, having visited in the 1920s came to live in St Ives with his then wife, the sculptor Barbara Hepworth, at the outbreak of the Second World War. They were later joined by the Russian emigrant Naum Gabo, and other artists. These included Peter Lanyon, Terry Frost, Patrick Heron, Bryan Wynter and Roger Hilton. St Ives also houses the Leach Pottery, where Bernard Leach, and his followers championed Japanese inspired studio pottery. Much of this modernist work can be seen in Tate St Ives. The Newlyn Society and Penwith Society of Arts continue to be active, and contemporary visual art is documented in a dedicated online journal.\n\n\n=== Music ===\n\nCornwall has a folk music tradition that has survived into the present and is well known for its unusual folk survivals such as Mummers Plays, the Furry Dance in Helston played by the famous Helston Town Band, and Obby Oss in Padstow.\nNewlyn is home to a food and music festival that hosts live music, cooking demonstrations, and displays of locally caught fish.\nAs in other former mining districts of Britain, male voice choirs and brass bands, such as Brass on the Grass concerts during the summer at Constantine, are still very popular in Cornwall. Cornwall also has around 40 brass bands, including the six-times National Champions of Great Britain, Camborne Youth Band, and the bands of Lanner and St Dennis.\nCornish players are regular participants in inter-Celtic festivals, and Cornwall itself has several inter-Celtic festivals such as Perranporth's Lowender Peran folk festival.Contemporary musician Richard D. James (also known as Aphex Twin) grew up in Cornwall, as did Luke Vibert and Alex Parks, winner of Fame Academy 2003. Roger Taylor, the drummer from the band Queen was also raised in the county, and currently lives not far from Falmouth. The American singer-songwriter Tori Amos now resides predominantly in North Cornwall not far from Bude with her family. The lutenist, lutarist, composer and festival director Ben Salfield lives in Truro. Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac was born in Redruth.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nCornwall's rich heritage and dramatic landscape have inspired numerous writers.\n\n\n==== Fiction ====\n\nSir Arthur Quiller-Couch, author of many novels and works of literary criticism, lived in Fowey: his novels are mainly set in Cornwall. Daphne du Maurier lived at Menabilly near Fowey and many of her novels had Cornish settings, including Rebecca, Jamaica Inn, Frenchman's Creek, My Cousin Rachel, and The House on the Strand. She is also noted for writing Vanishing Cornwall. Cornwall provided the inspiration for The Birds, one of her terrifying series of short stories, made famous as a film by Alfred Hitchcock. \nConan Doyle's The Adventure of the Devil's Foot featuring Sherlock Holmes is set in Cornwall. Winston Graham's series Poldark, Kate Tremayne's Adam Loveday series, Susan Cooper's novels Over Sea, Under Stone and Greenwitch, and Mary Wesley's The Camomile Lawn are all set in Cornwall. Writing under the pseudonym of Alexander Kent, Douglas Reeman sets parts of his Richard Bolitho and Adam Bolitho series in the Cornwall of the late 18th and the early 19th centuries, particularly in Falmouth. Gilbert K. Chesterton placed the action of many of his stories there.\nMedieval Cornwall is the setting of the trilogy by Monica Furlong, Wise Child, Juniper and Colman, as well as part of Charles Kingsley's Hereward the Wake.\nHammond Innes's novel, The Killer Mine; Charles de Lint's novel The Little Country; and Chapters 24-25 of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows take place in Cornwall (Shell Cottage, on the beach outside the fictional village of Tinworth).David Cornwell, who wrote espionage novels under the name John le Carr\u00e9, lived and worked in Cornwall. Nobel Prize-winning novelist William Golding was born in St Columb Minor in 1911, and returned to live near Truro from 1985 until his death in 1993. D. H. Lawrence spent a short time living in Cornwall. Rosamunde Pilcher grew up in Cornwall, and several of her books take place there.\n\n\n==== Poetry ====\n\nThe late Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman was famously fond of Cornwall and it featured prominently in his poetry. He is buried in the churchyard at St Enodoc's Church, Trebetherick.Charles Causley, the poet, was born in Launceston and is perhaps the best known of Cornish poets. Jack Clemo and the scholar A. L. Rowse were also notable Cornishmen known for their poetry; The Rev. R. S. Hawker of Morwenstow wrote some poetry which was very popular in the Victorian period.\nThe Scottish poet W. S. Graham lived in West Cornwall from 1944 until his death in 1986.The poet Laurence Binyon wrote \"For the Fallen\" (first published in 1914) while sitting on the cliffs between Pentire Point and The Rumps and a stone plaque was erected in 2001 to commemorate the fact. The plaque bears the inscription \"FOR THE FALLEN / Composed on these cliffs, 1914\". The plaque also bears below this the fourth stanza (sometimes referred to as \"The Ode\") of the poem:\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\nWe will remember them\n\n\n==== Other literary works ====\nCornwall produced a substantial number of passion plays such as the Ordinalia during the Middle Ages. Many are still extant, and provide valuable information about the Cornish language. See also Cornish literature\nColin Wilson, a prolific writer who is best known for his debut work The Outsider (1956) and for The Mind Parasites (1967), lived in Gorran Haven, a small village on the southern Cornish coast. The writer D. M. Thomas was born in Redruth but lived and worked in Australia and the United States before returning to his native Cornwall. He has written novels, poetry, and other works, including translations from Russian.\nThomas Hardy's drama The Queen of Cornwall (1923) is a version of the Tristan story; the second act of Richard Wagner's opera Tristan und Isolde takes place in Cornwall, as do Gilbert and Sullivan's operettas The Pirates of Penzance and Ruddigore.\nClara Vyvyan was the author of various books about many aspects of Cornish life such as Our Cornwall. She once wrote: \"The Loneliness of Cornwall is a loneliness unchanged by the presence of men, its freedoms a freedom inexpressible by description or epitaph. Your cannot say Cornwall is this or that. Your cannot describe it in a word or visualise it in a second. You may know the country from east to west and sea to sea, but if you close your eyes and think about it no clear-cut image rises before you. In this quality of changefulness have we possibly surprised the secret of Cornwall's wild spirit--in this intimacy the essence of its charm? Cornwall!\".\nA level of Tomb Raider: Legend, a game dealing with Arthurian Legend, takes place in Cornwall at a museum above King Arthur's tomb. The adventure game The Lost Crown is set in the fictional town of Saxton, which uses the Cornish settlements of Polperro, Talland and Looe as its model.The fairy tale Jack the Giant Killer takes place in Cornwall.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe main sports played in Cornwall are rugby, football and cricket. Athletes from Truro have done well in Olympic and Commonwealth Games fencing, winning several medals. Surfing is popular, particularly with tourists, thousands of which take to the water throughout the summer months. Some towns and villages have bowling clubs, and a wide variety of British sports are played throughout Cornwall. Cornwall is also one of the few places in England where shinty is played; the English Shinty Association is based in Penryn.\nThe Cornwall County Cricket Club plays as one of the minor counties of English cricket. Truro, and all of the towns and some villages have football clubs belonging to the Cornwall County Football Association.\n\n\n==== Rugby football ====\n\nViewed as an \"important identifier of ethnic affiliation\", rugby union has become a sport strongly tied to notions of Cornishness. and since the 20th century, rugby union has emerged as one of the most popular spectator and team sports in Cornwall (perhaps the most popular), with professional Cornish rugby footballers being described as a \"formidable force\", \"naturally independent, both in thought and deed, yet paradoxically staunch English patriots whose top players have represented England with pride and passion\".In 1985, sports journalist Alan Gibson made a direct connection between love of rugby in Cornwall and the ancient parish games of hurling and wrestling that existed for centuries before rugby officially began. Among Cornwall's native sports are a distinctive form of Celtic wrestling related to Breton wrestling, and Cornish hurling, a kind of mediaeval football played with a silver ball (distinct from Irish Hurling). Cornish Wrestling is Cornwall's oldest sport and as Cornwall's native tradition it has travelled the world to places like Victoria, Australia and Grass Valley, California following the miners and gold rushes. Cornish hurling now takes place at St. Columb Major, St Ives, and less frequently at Bodmin.In rugby league, Cornwall R.L.F.C., founded in 2021, will represent the county in the professional league system. The semi-pro club will start in the third tier RFL League 1. At amateur level, the county is represented by Cornish Rebels.\n\n\n==== Surfing and watersports ====\n\nDue to its long coastline, various maritime sports are popular in Cornwall, notably sailing and surfing. International events in both are held in Cornwall. Cornwall hosted the Inter-Celtic Watersports Festival in 2006. Surfing in particular is very popular, as locations such as Bude and Newquay offer some of the best surf in the UK. Pilot gig rowing has been popular for many years and the World championships takes place annually on the Isles of Scilly. On 2 September 2007, 300 surfers at Polzeath beach set a new world record for the highest number of surfers riding the same wave as part of the Global Surf Challenge and part of a project called Earthwave to raise awareness about global warming.\n\n\n==== Fencing ====\nAs its population is comparatively small, and largely rural, Cornwall's contribution to British national sport in the United Kingdom has been limited; the county's greatest successes have come in fencing. In 2014, half of the men's GB team fenced for Truro Fencing Club, and 3 Truro fencers appeared at the 2012 Olympics.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nCornwall has a strong culinary heritage. Surrounded on three sides by the sea amid fertile fishing grounds, Cornwall naturally has fresh seafood readily available; Newlyn is the largest fishing port in the UK by value of fish landed, and is known for its wide range of restaurants. Television chef Rick Stein has long operated a fish restaurant in Padstow for this reason, and Jamie Oliver chose to open his second restaurant, Fifteen, in Watergate Bay near Newquay. MasterChef host and founder of Smiths of Smithfield, John Torode, in 2007 purchased Seiners in Perranporth. One famous local fish dish is Stargazy pie, a fish-based pie in which the heads of the fish stick through the piecrust, as though \"star-gazing\". The pie is cooked as part of traditional celebrations for Tom Bawcock's Eve, but is not generally eaten at any other time.\n\nCornwall is perhaps best known though for its pasties, a savoury dish made with pastry. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and swede with salt and white pepper, but historically pasties had a variety of different fillings. \"Turmut, 'tates and mate\" (i.e. \"Turnip, potatoes and meat\", turnip being the Cornish and Scottish term for swede, itself an abbreviation of 'Swedish Turnip', the British term for rutabaga) describes a filling once very common. For instance, the licky pasty contained mostly leeks, and the herb pasty contained watercress, parsley, and shallots. Pasties are often locally referred to as oggies. Historically, pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam, apple and blackberry, plums or cherries.\nThe wet climate and relatively poor soil of Cornwall make it unsuitable for growing many arable crops. However, it is ideal for growing the rich grass required for dairying, leading to the production of Cornwall's other famous export, clotted cream. This forms the basis for many local specialities including Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream. Cornish clotted cream has Protected Geographical Status under EU law, and cannot be made anywhere else. Its principal manufacturer is A. E. Rodda & Son of Scorrier.\nLocal cakes and desserts include Saffron cake, Cornish heavy (hevva) cake, Cornish fairings biscuits, figgy 'obbin, Cream tea and whortleberry pie.There are also many types of beers brewed in Cornwall\u2014those produced by Sharp's Brewery, Skinner's Brewery, Keltek Brewery and St Austell Brewery are the best known\u2014including stouts, ales and other beer types. There is some small scale production of wine, mead and cider.\n\n\n== Politics and administration ==\n\n\n=== Cornish national identity ===\n\n Cornwall is recognised by Cornish and Celtic political groups as one of six Celtic nations, alongside Brittany, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Scotland and Wales. (The Isle of Man Government and the Welsh Government also recognise Asturias and Galicia.) Cornwall is represented, as one of the Celtic nations, at the Festival Interceltique de Lorient, an annual celebration of Celtic culture held in Brittany.Cornwall Council consider Cornwall's unique cultural heritage and distinctiveness to be one of the area's major assets. They see Cornwall's language, landscape, Celtic identity, political history, patterns of settlement, maritime tradition, industrial heritage, and non-conformist tradition, to be among the features making up its \"distinctive\" culture. However, it is uncertain how many of the people living in Cornwall consider themselves to be Cornish; results from different surveys (including the national census) have varied. In the 2001 census, 7 per cent of people in Cornwall identified themselves as Cornish, rather than British or English. However, activists have argued that this underestimated the true number as there was no explicit \"Cornish\" option included in the official census form. Subsequent surveys have suggested that as many as 44 per cent identify as Cornish. Many people in Cornwall say that this issue would be resolved if a Cornish option became available on the census. The question and content recommendations for the 2011 Census provided an explanation of the process of selecting an ethnic identity which is relevant to the understanding of the often quoted figure of 37,000 who claim Cornish identity.On 24 April 2014 it was announced that Cornish people have been granted minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nWith the exception of the Isles of Scilly, Cornwall is governed by a unitary authority, Cornwall Council, based in Truro. The Crown Court is based at the Courts of Justice in Truro. Magistrates' Courts are found in Truro (but at a different location to the Crown Court) and at Bodmin.\nThe Isles of Scilly form part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall, and have, at times, been served by the same county administration. Since 1890 they have been administered by their own unitary authority, the Council of the Isles of Scilly. They are grouped with Cornwall for other administrative purposes, such as the National Health Service and Devon and Cornwall Police.Before reorganisation on 1 April 2009, council functions throughout the rest of Cornwall were organised in two tiers, with Cornwall County Council and district councils for its six districts, Caradon, Carrick, Kerrier, North Cornwall, Penwith, and Restormel. While projected to streamline services, cut red tape and save around \u00a317 million a year, the reorganisation was met with wide opposition, with a poll in 2008 showing 89% disapproval from Cornish residents.The first elections for the unitary authority were held on 4 June 2009. The council has 123 seats; the largest party (in 2017) is the Conservatives, with 46 seats. The Liberal Democrats are the second-largest party, with 37 seats, with the Independents the third-largest grouping with 30.Before the creation of the unitary council, the former county council had 82 seats, the majority of which were held by the Liberal Democrats, elected at the 2005 county council elections. The six former districts had a total of 249 council seats, and the groups with greatest numbers of councillors were Liberal Democrats, Conservatives and Independents.\n\n\n=== Parliament and national politics ===\nFollowing a review by the Boundary Commission for England taking effect at the 2010 general election, Cornwall is divided into six county constituencies to elect MPs to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.\nBefore the 2010 boundary changes Cornwall had five constituencies, all of which were won by Liberal Democrats at the 2005 general election. In the 2010 general election Liberal Democrat candidates won three constituencies and Conservative candidates won three other constituencies. At the 2015 general election all six Cornish seats were won by Conservative candidates; all these Conservative MPs retained their seats at the 2017 general election, and the Conservatives won all six constituencies again at the 2019 general election.\nUntil 1832, Cornwall had 44 MPs\u2014more than any other county\u2014reflecting the importance of tin to the Crown. Most of the increase in numbers of MPs came between 1529 and 1584 after which there was no change until 1832.\n\n\n=== Devolution movement ===\nCornish nationalists have organised into two political parties: Mebyon Kernow, formed in 1951, and the Cornish Nationalist Party. In addition to the political parties, there are various interest groups such as the Revived Cornish Stannary Parliament and the Celtic League. The Cornish Constitutional Convention was formed in 2000 as a cross-party organisation including representatives from the private, public and voluntary sectors to campaign for the creation of a Cornish Assembly, along the lines of the National Assembly for Wales, Northern Ireland Assembly and the Scottish Parliament. Between 5 March 2000 and December 2001, the campaign collected the signatures of 41,650 Cornish residents endorsing the call for a devolved assembly, along with 8,896 signatories from outside Cornwall. The resulting petition was presented to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair.\n\n\n== Emergency services ==\nDevon and Cornwall Police\nCornwall Fire and Rescue Service\nSouth Western Ambulance Service\nCornwall Air Ambulance\nHM Coastguard\nCornwall Search & Rescue Team\nBritish Transport Police\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nCornwall is one of the poorest parts of the United Kingdom in terms of per capita GDP and average household incomes. At the same time, parts of the county, especially on the coast, have high house prices, driven up by demand from relatively wealthy retired people and second-home owners. The GVA per head was 65% of the UK average for 2004. The GDP per head for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly was 79.2% of the EU-27 average for 2004, the UK per head average was 123.0%. In 2011, the latest available figures, Cornwall's (including the Isles of Scilly) measure of wealth was 64% of the European average per capita.Historically mining of tin (and later also of copper) was important in the Cornish economy. The first reference to this appears to be by Pytheas: see above. Julius Caesar was the last classical writer to mention the tin trade, which appears to have declined during the Roman occupation. The tin trade revived in the Middle Ages and its importance to the Kings of England resulted in certain privileges being granted to the tinners; the Cornish rebellion of 1497 is attributed to grievances of the tin miners. In the mid-19th century, however, the tin trade again fell into decline. Other primary sector industries that have declined since the 1960s include china clay production, fishing and farming.\nToday, the Cornish economy depends heavily on its tourist industry, which makes up around a quarter of the economy. The official measures of deprivation and poverty at district and 'sub-ward' level show that there is great variation in poverty and prosperity in Cornwall with some areas among the poorest in England and others among the top half in prosperity. For example, the ranking of 32,482 sub-wards in England in the index of multiple deprivation (2006) ranged from 819th (part of Penzance East) to 30,899th (part of Saltash Burraton in Caradon), where the lower number represents the greater deprivation.Cornwall is one of two UK areas designated as 'less developed regions' which qualify for Cohesion Policy grants from the European Union. It was granted Objective 1 status by the European Commission for 2000 to 2006, followed by further rounds of funding known as 'Convergence Funding' from 2007 to 2013 and 'Growth Programme' for 2014 to 2020.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nTourism is estimated to contribute up to 24% of Cornwall's gross domestic product. In 2011 tourism brought \u00a31.85 billion into the Cornish economy. Cornwall's unique culture, spectacular landscape and mild climate make it a popular tourist destination, despite being somewhat distant from the United Kingdom's main centres of population. Surrounded on three sides by the English Channel and Celtic Sea, Cornwall has many miles of beaches and cliffs; the South West Coast Path follows a complete circuit of both coasts. Other tourist attractions include moorland, country gardens, museums, historic and prehistoric sites, and wooded valleys. Five million tourists visit Cornwall each year, mostly drawn from within the UK. Visitors to Cornwall are served by the airport at Newquay, whilst private jets, charters and helicopters are also served by Perranporth airfield; nightsleeper and daily rail services run between Cornwall, London and other regions of the UK. Cornwall has a tourism-based seasonal economy.\nNewquay and Porthtowan are popular destinations for surfers. In recent years, the Eden Project near St Austell has been a major financial success, drawing one in eight of Cornwall's visitors in 2004.In the summer of 2018, due to the recognition of its beaches and weather through social media and the marketing of travel companies, Cornwall received about 20 per cent more visitors than the usual 4.5 million figure. The sudden rise and demand of tourism in Cornwall caused multiple traffic and safety issues in coastal areas.In October 2021, Cornwall was shortlisted for the UK City of Culture 2025.\n\n\n=== Fishing ===\n\nOther industries include fishing, although this has been significantly re-structured by EU fishing policies (as of 2010 the Southwest Handline Fishermen's Association has started to revive the fishing industry).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nAgriculture, once an important part of the Cornish economy, has declined significantly relative to other industries. However, there is still a strong dairy industry, with products such as Cornish clotted cream.\n\n\n=== Mining ===\n\nMining of tin and copper was also an industry, but today the derelict mine workings survive only as a World Heritage Site. However, the Camborne School of Mines, which was relocated to Penryn in 2004, is still a world centre of excellence in the field of mining and applied geology and the grant of World Heritage status has attracted funding for conservation and heritage tourism. China clay extraction has also been an important industry in the St Austell area, but this sector has been in decline, and this, coupled with increased mechanisation, has led to a decrease in employment in this sector, although the industry still employs around 2,133 people in Cornwall, and generates over \u00a380 million to the local economy.In March 2016, a Canadian company, Strongbow Exploration, had acquired, from administration, a 100% interest in the South Crofty tin mine and the associated mineral rights in Cornwall with the aim of reopening the mine and bringing it back to full production. Work is currently ongoing to build a water filtration plant in order to dewater the mine.\n\n\n=== Internet ===\nCornwall is the landing point for twenty-two of the world's fastest high-speed undersea and transatlantic fibre optic cables, making Cornwall an important hub within Europe's Internet infrastructure. The Superfast Cornwall project completed in 2015, and saw 95% of Cornish houses and businesses connected to a fibre-based broadband network, with over 90% of properties able to connect with speeds above 24 Mbit/s.\n\n\n=== Aerospace ===\nThe county's newest industry is aviation: Newquay Airport is the home of a growing business park with Enterprise Zone status, known as Aerohub. There are also plans to establish Spaceport Cornwall at Newquay, in partnership with Goonhilly satellite tracking station near Helston in south Cornwall.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nCornwall's population was 537,400 in the 2011 census, with a population density of 144 people per square kilometre, ranking it 40th and 41st, respectively, among the 47 counties of England. Cornwall's population was 95.7% White British and has a relatively high rate of population growth. At 11.2% in the 1980s and 5.3% in the 1990s, it had the fifth-highest population growth rate of the counties of England. The natural change has been a small population decline, and the population increase is due to inward migration into Cornwall. According to the 1991 census, the population was 469,800.\nCornwall has a relatively high retired population, with 22.9% of pensionable age, compared with 20.3% for the United Kingdom as a whole. This may be due partly to Cornwall's rural and coastal geography increasing its popularity as a retirement location, and partly to outward migration of younger residents to more economically diverse areas.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nOver 10,000 students attend Cornwall's two universities, Falmouth University and the University of Exeter (including Camborne School of Mines). Falmouth University is a specialist public university for the creative industries and arts, while the University Of Exeter has two campuses in Cornwall, Truro and Penryn, the latter shared with Falmouth. Penryn campus is home to educational departments such as the rapidly growing Centre for Ecology and Conservation (CEC), the Environment and Sustainability Institute (ESI), and the Institute of Cornish Studies. \nCornwall has a comprehensive education system, with 31 state and eight independent secondary schools. There are three further education colleges: Truro and Penwith College, Cornwall College and Callywith College which opened in September 2017. The Isles of Scilly only has one school, while the former Restormel district has the highest school population, and school year sizes are around 200, with none above 270. Before the introduction of comprehensive schools there were a number of grammar schools and secondary modern schools, e.g. the schools that later became Sir James Smith's School and Wadebridge School. There are also primary schools in many villages and towns: e.g. St Mabyn Church of England Primary School.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChristianity in Cornwall\nIndex of Cornwall-related articles\nOutline of Cornwall \u2013 overview of the wide range of topics covered by this subject\nTamar Valley AONB\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBalchin, W.

    "The Dancing Floor": "Blood on the Dance Floor was an American electronic music group from Orlando, Florida, formed in 2006. The group's longest-standing lineup, from 2009 to 2016, consisted of Jesus David Torres also known as Dahvie Vanity (born 1984) and Jayy Von Monroe (born 1991). The group released nine studio albums before breaking up in 2016 following Von Monroe's departure. It was reformed by Vanity the following year, initially with Fallon Vendetta. After Vendetta's departure, Vanity became the sole member of the group. Since 2019, Vanity has performed under the name Kawaii Monster and most recently the Most Vivid Nightmares.\n\n\n== History ==\nAround September 2006, Jesus David Torres,  also known as \"Dahvie Vanity\", on his 22nd birthday, started a trio called Love the Fashion with Christopher Mongillo and Rebecca Fugate. The group was originally a joke, which soon developed into Blood on the Dance Floor in 2007. The group self-released their first album, Let's Start a Riot, in April 2008. Not being able to tour, Mongillo and Fugate left the band while Vanity toured the Orlando, Florida area.During the recording of their second album, It's Hard to be a Diamond in a Rhinestone World, Mongillo and Fugate left, and the band was picked up by producer and writer Rusty Wilmot. During the recording of this album, Garrett Marshal McLaughlin (\"Garrett Ecstasy\") was recruited to do backup vocals and screaming. The CD was self-released in October 2008. Only 300 copies were made.Vanity and Ecstasy recorded the singles \"Siq With a Q\" and \"Suicide Club\" as a duo in 2008, and released three extended plays over the first half of 2009, I Scream I Scream, OMFG Sneak Peak, and Extended Play. The duo embarked on the OMFG Tour with other local bands Electric Valentine, Weston Buck, The Greenlight District, and The Crush in promotion of their upcoming album then titled OMFG.As the OMFG tour continued and concluded without Vanity, Ecstasy left the band after accusing Vanity of being a sexual predator and was replaced by Jeremy Brian Griffis, known by his stage name \"Jayy Von Monroe\". Along with Von Monroe, Vanity and the group's new drummer and rapper, Nick \"Nasty\" Wenzel, released \"Horrifically Delicious\".Many of the songs originally recorded with Ecstasy intended for the upcoming album OMFG were re-recorded with new vocals by Von Monroe. The previous concept of the OMFG album was scrapped, and rebranded as EPIC, set for release in 2010. The band went on tour over spring and summer 2010 to promote the release of Epic. With Jeffree Star they recorded three songs for that album. However, the collaboration was short-lived because during the Looking Hot & Dangerous Tour, Star had accused Vanity of being a pedophile and a predator, claiming to have witnessed questionable behavior. Star later chose to go back on his accusations and sweep what he claimed to have seen under the rug. He was then featured on their 2014 single \"Poison Apple\", from the album Bitchcraft. As with the previous conflict with Garrett, the three singles featuring Jeffree's vocals were re-recorded with vocals by Von Monroe, and the original tracks were not featured on the final album.\nIn October 2010, the album Epic charted No. 5 on the dance/electronic Billboard chart. The band headlined the Epic Tour and the Epic Tour Part II in support of the album.Even before the release of Epic, recording began for Blood on the Dance Floor's fourth album, All the Rage!!. The duo collaborated with several artists for the album, including Lady Nogrady, JJ Demon, and Nick Nasty. The album was preceded by several singles to promote the release, including \"Bewitched\", \"Yo Ho\", and \"P.L.U.R.\" The band embarked on Warped Tour 2011 in June 2011, and released the album while on tour.\nA music video for their hit single from the album, \"Bewitched\", featured Nicole \"Lady\" Nogrady, who later said that she felt disrespected by the band during production of the album as well as on the music video, and found herself having to confront the band directly in order for her name to appear on the credits of her work with them. The song was subsequently performed by other female vocalists in place of Nogrady at live shows, and was re-recorded with vocals by Haley Rose for their 2013 acoustic album Blood Unplugged.\nThe album peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Top Electronic Albums chart. At the end of 2011, the duo headlined the All the Rage Tour and was planning the 'Tis the Season to be Killing Tour.In celebration of BOTDF's fourth anniversary, a digital compilation album entitled The Legend of Blood on the Dance Floor was set to be released on Halloween. The compilation's release date was pushed back, originally planned to be released as a CD, it was released as a SoundCloud playlist instead. The compilation features remastered versions of songs from the band's first four albums.\nBlood on the Dance Floor's fifth album, Evolution, was released on June 19, 2012 along with a deluxe edition that featured acoustic versions of two songs. Two music videos and four singles were released from the album.\nThe album featured tracks in collaboration with Haley Rose, Amelia Arsenic, Shawn Brandon, Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, Elena Vladimirova, and Deuce.As a thank you to their fans they released the three-song free EP Clubbed to Death! on June 20, 2012, for free through an app on Facebook. Their sixth EP, The Anthem of the Outcast, was released on October 30, 2012.Rumors of a breakup in 2013 proved to be a hoax. Bad Blood was slated for release in September 2013. On February 18, 2013, the lead single \"I Refuse to Sink! (Fuck the Fame)\" was released, followed by the second single, \"Crucified by Your Lies\", and a third, \"Something Grimm\", on July 2, 2013.Andrew \"Drew\" Apathy joined in early 2014, and a new EP, Bitchcraft, was released in June 2014. Their single \"We're Takin over!\" featuring Deuce was released February 7.Blood on the Dance Floor released their first single off their EP Cruel Pornography: \"The Sexorcist\". In August, they released their new project and started planning the \"Reign of Blood\" tour. On February 14, 2016, the band released the single \"Safe Word\" on iTunes.Mid-2016 marked the end of producing and co-writing by Rusty Wilmot (2008\u20132016).In April 2016, Blood on the Dance Floor announced a 24-date tour with Steven Joseph and BrokenCYDE. On August 17, BOTDF released their September 30-scheduled album Scissors on Apple Music.On September 14, 2016, Dahvie Vanity said that the group would be disbanding after one final tour as a result of Jayy's departure earlier that month. For a while afterwards, Vanity created and worked on a new project called Sinners Are Winners, releasing an EP titled For Beginners and full-length The Invocation.In April 2017, Vanity announced that there would be a new member, and that Blood on the Dance Floor would be returning on May 5 of that year without Jayy Von Monroe. In May 2017, it was revealed that Dahvie's girlfriend, Fallon Vendetta, had temporarily joined Blood on the Dance Floor. With Vendetta, they released the singles \"Resurrection Spell\", \"Love Like Voodoo\", \"Six Feet Under\", \"Yo Ho 2 (Pirate's Life)\", \"Ghosting\" and \"Destroy\". Their album Kawaii Monster was released on October 31, 2017. Kawaii Monster pre-orders included a second disc, a remastered edition of Let's Start a Riot. The band also released an exclusive EP: You Are the Heart. In 2018, they released Haunted, followed by Cinema Erotica and You Are the Heart. Vendetta departed the group shortly afterward, leaving Vanity as the sole remaining member of the group.\nIn 2019, shortly after the band's second break up, Vanity started a new project: Kawaii Monster. He released the songs \"From Heaven to Hell\", \"Total Nightmare\", \"Dear Best Friend\", \"It's a Sunny Place for Shady People\", \"I Am With You\", \"Finding Blessings In Dark Places\", \"The Violet Flame\", \"It's All Just a Dream\" and \"Rage Against the Dying Light\".After a five-month break from making music, Vanity rebranded himself again as \"the Most Vivid Nightmares\" and released \"Drowning In the Darkness\" on November 13, 2020. He later released a second single: \"Love Forever True\". On January 1, 2021, Vanity released a new version of Blood on the Dance Floor's \"Bewitched\" as \"Bewitched Reimagined\" featuring singer Sammy Beare.\n\n\n== Musical style and influences ==\nThe group's style couples hypersexual lyrics with electronica or electronic, but also heavily incorporates electropop, dance-pop, and crunkcore.Vanity stated in an interview that Jeffree Star is a huge influence on Blood on the Dance Floor.\n\n\n== Sexual assault allegations against Dahvie Vanity ==\n\nSince the allegations first surfaced in 2009, at least 21 women have made sexual assault, child molestation, and rape allegations against Vanity. Former bandmates Garrett Ecstasy, who left the band in 2009, and Jayy Von Monroe, who left in 2016, have described Vanity as a sexual predator. In an interview with television journalist Chris Hansen, Jayy Von Monroe accused Vanity of abuse as well, stating that Vanity forced him to tour without his HIV medication which caused him to nearly contract AIDS. Von Monroe also stated that he later made a full recovery after leaving the band in 2016.

    "Stockholm congestion tax": "The Stockholm congestion tax (Swedish: Tr\u00e4ngselskatt i Stockholm), also referred to as the Stockholm congestion charge, is a congestion pricing system implemented as a tax levied on most vehicles entering and exiting central Stockholm, Sweden.  The congestion tax was implemented on a permanent basis on August 1, 2007, after a seven-month trial period between January 3, 2006 and July 31, 2006. It was inspired by Singapore's Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) system, which first introduced it in 1975.\nThe primary purpose of the congestion tax is to reduce traffic congestion and improve the environmental situation in central Stockholm. The funds collected will be used for new road constructions in and around Stockholm.A referendum was held in September 2006, a few months after the end of the trial period. In the referendum the residents of Stockholm municipality voted yes and in 14 other municipalities voted no to implement it permanently. On October 1, 2006, the leaders of the winning parties in the 2006 general election, declared they would implement the Stockholm congestion tax permanently. The Riksdag approved this on June 20, 2007, and the congestion tax came into effect on August 1, 2007.On 1 January 2016, congestion taxes were increased in the inner-city parts of Stockholm, and also the congestion tax began to be charged on Essingeleden. The measure was implemented not only to improve accessibility and the environment, but also to help develop the infrastructure.\n\n\n== Affected area ==\nThe congestion tax area encompasses essentially the entire Stockholm City Centre, which includes S\u00f6dermalm, Norrmalm, \u00d6stermalm, Vasastaden, Kungsholmen, Stora Essingen, Lilla Essingen and Djurg\u00e5rden.There are unmanned electronic control points (in Swedish: betalstation, literally payment station) at all entrances to this area. The congestion tax is applied on both entry and exit of the affected area.From 1 January 2016, the congestion tax began to be charged in on Essingeleden motorway. Congestion tax was introduced at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden in order to reduce traffic jams in peak periods, and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden, the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks. The control points on Essingeleden are located at the Kristineberg Interchange and at the access and exit ramps for Tranebergsbron at the Fredh\u00e4ll Interchange. The transport agencies involved expect to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10% in peak hours. One week after the tax began to be charged, traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22% compared to a normal day in mid-December.\n\n\n== Amount of tax to pay ==\n\nThe amount of tax payable depends on what time of the day a motorist enters or exits the congestion tax area. There is no charge on Saturdays, Sundays, public holidays or the day before public holidays, nor during nights (18:30 \u2013 06:29), nor during the month of July.The congestion tax was raised in January 2016, the first increase of the tax since it was introduced permanently in 2007. The highest increase took place at the two highest rush hour periods, 7:30 to 8:29, and 16:00 to 17:29, from SEK 20 to SEK 35. The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport, and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area. Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle.  The additional funds will contribute to finance the extension of the Stockholm metro.The following table summarizes the charges for Essingeleden and the Inner City since 1 January 2016.\n\n\n=== Method of payment ===\n\nPayment of the congestion tax cannot be made at the control points \u2014 they merely register which vehicles have passed them. A bill is sent to the vehicle owner at the end of each month, with the tax decisions for the preceding month's control point passages. The bill must be paid before the end of the next month. The vehicle owner is responsible for the payment of the tax, even if the bill does not arrive.The bill can be delivered in three different ways. By default delivery by mail to the vehicle owner's registered address, or opting for electronic delivery to the vehicle owner's Internet bank, or opting for a direct debit arrangement called Autogiro that allows the tax to be automatically deducted from the vehicle owner's bank account when the bill is due.Failure to pay the tax within the allotted time results in a reminder bill being sent with an added 500 SEK fee. If the tax along with the reminder fee is still unpaid within 30 days after the reminder bill was sent, the case will be forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Administration, which adds an additional fee of at least 600 SEK, and the vehicle owner will be noted in the Enforcement Register unless payment is made.The same rules are from 2015 valid for foreign-registered vehicles. The authority has contracted collection agencies in the most common countries who charge the owners.\n\n\n=== Tax deductibility ===\nThe congestion tax may be deducted from taxable income for both private individuals and businesses. Private individuals may deduct the congestion tax for business journeys, and for traveling between the home and workplace according to the usual rules of car cost deduction (1:80 SEK/km), that is if the distance is at least 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) and the time saved by traveling by own car compared to public transport is at least 2 hours per day. If this is not valid, the public transport cost can be deducted (without congestion tax). The first 10.000 SEK can not be deducted (the public transport pass inside Stockholm county costs 8.400 SEK during year 2016). Businesses may deduct all congestion tax expenses, also private driving with company cars (there is a general tax on the right to drive company cars in private).\n\n\n== Exemptions from the congestion tax ==\n\n\n=== Exempt vehicles ===\nSome classes of vehicles are exempt from the congestion tax:\nEmergency services vehicles\nBuses with a total weight of at least 14 tonnes\nDiplomatic corps registered vehicles\nMotorcycles\nMilitary vehicles\nCars that according to the Swedish Road Administration's vehicle registry are equipped for propulsion with entirely or partially with electricity, or other fuel gas than liquefied petroleum gas, or with a fuel mixture that predominantly consists of alcohol. This exemption is no longer valid for newly purchased vehicles, but remains valid for vehicles purchased between January 1, 2009 and August 1, 2012.\nCars with parking permit for disabled persons, after application to the Swedish National Tax Board.  This exemption is not valid if the car is used for professional purposes.Foreign-registered vehicles were exempt from the congestion tax until 2014. This was mainly for practical reasons, as it was hard to get access to foreign car registers and to claim payment from foreign citizens. The exemption was removed as a result of objections from companies relating to unfair taxation, and because the \"Eurovignette\" EU directive (1999/62/EC article 7 and 2006/38/EC) requires that user charges may not discriminate on the grounds of the nationality of the haulier or the origin of the vehicle.\n\n\n== Technology ==\n\nThe vehicles passing the control points are identified through automatic number plate recognition. The equipment, consisting of cameras, laser detectors, antennas, and information signs are mounted on a set of gantries at each control point.\nThere are no payment booths at the control points, they are all unmanned and payment is done by other means later (see Method of payment above). At a traditional toll booth, a substantial percentage of the toll goes to costs for the staff, which is avoided here.\nFor those living on the island of Liding\u00f6 or otherwise often traveling there, an optional DSRC transponder can be used also to more accurately identify the vehicles, as an incorrect identification results in the Liding\u00f6 exemption rule not taking effect (see Geographic exemptions above). The DSRC transponders that were used during the congestion tax trial period are useless now and should be returned to the Swedish Road Administration.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Debate ===\nThe congestion tax was before its inception a highly debated proposition, especially in the peripheral parts of Stockholm county where residents who lived outside of the control points but worked in the city center argued that they should also have a say in whether the proposition was to be accepted. In the time since the control points were put in place, however, the debate has calmed down considerably as the system works smoothly and the actual cost of passing these stations is acceptable to most residents, as well as the fact that central Stockholm has been getting cleaner since the proposition went into action.\nThe debate has instead in many instances shifted toward the political reasons behind the proposition, where some argue that the proposition is simply a way to punish the residents of Stockholm for the centralized Swedish political system, which reportedly many people in rural parts of Sweden feel favours Stockholm above other regions.Initially this was planned as a congestion fee, not a tax. But the Swedish government ruled that this kind of endeavor was considered a tax and not a fee, and thus this was made a governmental tax, not a local tax, as municipalities in Sweden are not allowed to create new taxes.\n\n\n=== Trial period ===\nA seven-month trial period of the congestion tax, called The Stockholm trials (Stockholmsf\u00f6rs\u00f6ket), took place between January 3, 2006 and July 31, 2006. In addition to the optical recognition of license plates, DSRC transponders were used to identify vehicles, and opting to use one was a precondition for using direct debit for the payment of the tax.\nThe Road Administration have claimed that traffic passing in and out of the cordon reduced by between 20 and 25% during the period of the trial, and that air quality improved; after the trial, traffic volumes built up again. 96% complied with paying the tax on time, which raised 399 m SEK during the period.\n\n\n=== Referendum ===\nLocal consultative referendums regarding whether to permanently implement the congestion tax were held in Stockholm Municipality and several other municipalities in Stockholm County on September 17, 2006.\nIt was only the referendum in Stockholm Municipality that the at the time reigning government would use as a basis for the decision.\nThe municipalities surrounding Stockholm in Stockholm County, especially those that are part of the city of Stockholm, showed discontent with the fact that the people of those municipalities get no say whether the congestion taxes will be implemented permanently. A substantial number of the inhabitants of the nearby municipalities travel to and from work through the congestion tax area. Therefore, several of these municipalities decided also to have local referendums. A municipality is allowed to hold a consultative referendum at any time, but as the congestion tax had to be decided at the national parliament level it was unclear how the results would be interpreted if the government there changed after the 2006 general election, which was held the same day as these referendums.\nIn Stockholm the question asked on the ballots was (translated from Swedish): sv:Tr\u00e4ngselskatt i Stockholm#F\u00f6rdelning och demokrati\n\nEnvironmental fees/congestion tax means that fees will be charged in road traffic with the purpose to reduce queuing and improve the environment. The income will be returned to the Stockholm region for investments in public transport and roads.\nIn the other municipalities the question on the ballots were (translated from Swedish):\n\nDo you believe that congestion tax should be permanently introduced in Stockholm?\n\n\n==== Results ====\nResults from the referendums. The figures and percentages do not include blank and invalid votes.\n\n\n==== Interpretation of the results ====\nPrior to, and a short while after, the election day it was not clear how big of an effect the results of the municipal referendums would have, especially for the referendums held in the municipalities other than Stockholm.\nThe Social Democratic government prior to the 2006 general election (cabinet Persson) stated that they would only take into consideration the results of the referendum held in Stockholm Municipality, while the opposition parties (Alliance for Sweden) stated that they would take into consideration the results of referendums the other municipalities as well if they won the election.The opposition parties won the election and before they formed a government (cabinet Reinfeldt)  their party leaders announced on October 1, 2006 to implement the congestion tax permanently, and that the revenue would go entirely to new road constructions in and around Stockholm instead of entirely to public transport in Stockholm as it was during the trial period. The Riksdag approved the congestion tax on June 20, 2007, for reintroduction on August 1, 2007.\n\n\n== Effects ==\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, despite a reduction in traffic and increase in favorable public opinion congestion in Stockholm increased.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Automatic number plate recognition ===\nThe automatic number-plate recognition has its shortcomings. Number plates from Finland and Lithuania have a similar format compared to Swedish number plates, with three letters and three digits. The system can't see the difference, and a Swedish owner might falsely be charged. Also stolen and forged plates have caused false payment demand on innocent people. All vehicles are photographed so people who notice the false charging and object will have the charge waived.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRoad pricing\nCongestion pricing\nElectronic toll collection\nGothenburg congestion tax\nMilan Area C\nSan Francisco congestion pricing\nElectronic Road Pricing (Singapore)\nSingapore Area Licensing Scheme\nLondon Congestion Charge\nManchester congestion charge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGullberg, Boff; Isaksson, Karolina (editors) (2009).

    "Midwest League": "The Midwest League was a Minor League Baseball league, established in 1947 and based  in the Midwestern United States. It was classified as a Class A league.\nThe Midwest League began as the Illinois State League (1947\u20131948), then became the Mississippi\u2013Ohio Valley League (1949\u20131955). In 1956, the Mississippi\u2013Ohio Valley League was renamed the Midwest League. In its final years, the league had 16 teams in two divisions. The Lansing Lugnuts and Wisconsin Timber Rattlers franchises jointly have won the most league championships, with nine each.\nThe Midwest League was replaced by the new High-A Central league.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Midwest League directly evolved from two earlier leagues in the region. In 1947, the Class D Illinois State League (ISL) began operation with six Illinois teams \u2013 the Belleville Stags, Centralia Cubs, Marion Indians, Mattoon Indians, Mount Vernon Braves and the West Frankfort Cardinals. In 1949, the ISL changed its name to the Mississippi\u2013Ohio Valley League after Marion moved their franchise to Kentucky and became the Paducah Chiefs. In 1954, the Mississippi-Ohio Valley League expanded, adding teams in Clinton and Dubuque, Iowa. The Mississippi-Ohio Valley League was then renamed Midwest League in 1956.\nThe original teams in 1956, the first year of Midwest League play, were: Clinton Pirates, Decatur Commodores, Dubuque Packers, Kokomo Dodgers, Lafayette Red Sox, Mattoon Phillies, Michigan City White Caps and the Paris Lakers. Mattoon is the oldest franchise in the MWL, evolving into today's Fort Wayne TinCaps, while Clinton is the oldest MWL locale.In 1960, the Davenport, Iowa based Quad City Braves joined the league as an expansion team. In 1962, Appleton, Burlington, and Cedar Rapids joined the Midwest League from the Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League which folded operations when those franchises switched leagues. All those franchised remain in the league today. In 1963, the Midwest League was designated as a Class A league, after the minor league classification structure was reorganized.The 1975 Waterloo Royals, led by future MLB All-Stars Willie Wilson and Dan Quisenberry, are ranked #60 on MiLB.com's Top 100 Teams. The Royals finished the season 93\u201335.In 1976, the Midwest League contracted from ten teams to eight, as franchises in Danville and Dubuque were eliminated. In 1982, the league expanded from 8 to 12 teams, adding the Beloit Brewers, the Danville Suns, the Madison Muskies, and the Springfield Cardinals. The Peoria Suns relocated from Danville in 1983, and acquired their current name, Peoria Chiefs, the following year. In 1988, the league began splitting its season into two halves and expanded from 12 to 14 teams, with the addition of franchises in South Bend, Indiana, and Rockford, Illinois. During the 1990s several teams changed cities as Major League Baseball placed higher standards on minor league baseball facilities; franchises in smaller cities were sold to new owners who moved those teams to new ballparks in larger cities. Kenosha, Madison, Rockford, Springfield, Waterloo, and Wausau lost teams during this decade while Battle Creek, Dayton, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids (West Michigan), Kane County, and Lansing gained teams.The 1978 Appleton Foxes are ranked #93 on the Top-100 All Time teams by MiLB.com. Led by future Cy Young Award winner LaMarr Hoyt, the team finished 97\u201340. Harry Chappas, Ross Baumgarten and Britt Burns were all called up to the parent Chicago White Sox at the conclusion of the MWL season. The 97 wins by the Foxes remains a Midwest League record.The Fort Wayne TinCaps are the oldest franchise in the league, having begun as the Mattoon Indians in 1947 and playing in Keokuk, Iowa; Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin; and Kenosha, Wisconsin, before moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1993. The Clinton LumberKings have been in one city longer than any Midwest League team, having called Clinton, Iowa, home since 1954.\nThe Southwest Michigan Devil Rays moved to Midland, Michigan, and became the Great Lakes Loons prior to the 2007 season.\nOn September 2, 2008, Minor League Baseball announced that two teams would transfer from the fellow Class A South Atlantic League to the Midwest League: the Lake County Captains (an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians playing in Eastlake, Ohio) and the Bowling Green Hot Rods (an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays playing in Bowling Green, Kentucky).The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30.The league ceased operations after the 2020 season and was replaced by the new High-A Central in conjunction with Major League Baseball's reorganization of Minor League Baseball. The Bowling Green Hot Rods moved to the new High-A East and the Clinton LumberKings, Kane County Cougars, and Burlington Bees were not invited to continue in affiliated baseball. The Kane County Cougars joined the independent American Association of Professional Baseball; the Clinton LumberKings and the Burlington Bees joined the collegiate summer Prospect League.\n\n\n== League champions ==\n\n\n== Teams since 1956 ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nBaseball awards#U.S. minor leagues\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Midwest League website\nA Fan's Guide to the Midwest League",

    "2009 South Ossetian parliamentary election": "Parliamentary elections were held in South Ossetia on 31 May 2009. The result was a victory for the ruling Unity Party, which won seventeen of the 34 seats. Two opposition parties were not permitted to run out of concern that they might not be loyal to President Eduard Kokoity.Under laws of Georgia, the elections were illegal.The European Union, the United States, and NATO have issued statements saying these organisations consider the elections illegal, and have rejected their results.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Republic of South Ossetia has a population of about 70,000. It has had de facto independence from central Georgian rule since the 1991\u20131992 South Ossetia War. After the August 2008 South Ossetia war, Russia recognized the independence of South Ossetia, followed by Nicaragua. Other countries, including Georgia, consider South Ossetia part of Georgia's constitutional territory.\n\n\n== Campaign ==\n\nFour parties were contesting for 34 seats in the Parliament of South Ossetia. According to the central election commission, 45,000 people were registered to vote on Sunday. This was the first South Ossetian election since the republic obtained its limited international recognition in 2008. The election was observed by over 70 observers from 10 countries, including representatives from Abkhazia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Nagorno-Karabakh, Ukraine, Poland, and Russia. Among the observers were Vladimir Churov, the chairman of the Central Election Commission of Russia and Giulietto Chiesa, Italian MEP for Italy of Values, former member of the Italian Communist Party.About 100 Russian and international reporters arrived in South Ossetia to cover the event. Voters were able to cast ballots at 95 polling stations, 88 in South Ossetia and 7 in Russia (6 of them opened in North Ossetia and 1 in Moscow).  No other overseas polling stations were open.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe election was conducted using the party-list proportional representation system with a 7% election threshold.  For South Ossetian authorities to consider the election valid, the voter turnout would have been at least 50% + 1 vote, and at least two parties would have acquired securing seats in the parliament.  If these criteria hadn't been fulfilled, the South Ossetian legislation provided for a repeat election in four months.\n\n\n== Parties ==\nThe following parties participated in the election:\nUnity Party\nCommunist Party of South Ossetia\nPeople's Party of South Ossetia\nFatherland Socialist PartyThe Unity Party is the ruling party in the current parliament. According to Reuters, Unity, Communists, and the People's party support the current President Eduard Kokoity, while the Fatherland Socialist party opposes him.  Two opposition parties were barred from running.\n\n\n== Opinion polls ==\n\n\n== Results ==\nAs of 10:00 UTC, 59.88% of registered voters had cast their votes, crossing the electoral threshold of 50% plus one vote. The South Ossetian election commission has thus declared the elections valid.According to the preliminary results, the Unity Party has obtained the most votes with 46.38% of the vote, followed by People's Party with 22.58% and the Communists with 22.25%, thus securing 17, 9 and 8 parliament seats respectively, while the Fatherland Socialist Party fell just short of passing the 7% threshold with only 6.37%. The official results were expected by June 7.\nAccording to the final results, the Unity Party won 17 seats with 21,246 votes, the People's Party won nine seats with 10,345 votes and the Communist Party won eight seats with 10,194 votes.\n\n\n== Reaction ==\nInternational observers\nGroup of 11 observers, representing Italy, Germany, Poland, and Russia noted the election was held 'complying with common democratic standards. Italian MEP Giulietto Chiesa commented: These elections were a model of democracy. Europe\nThe EU refused to accept either the legality of the election or its results.\nNATO\nThe Secretary-General of NATO, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said the alliance did not recognize the elections and reiterated \"its full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders\".\n Georgia\nGeorgia dismissed the election as illegitimate. Temur Iakobashvili, the State Minister for Reintegration commented:What they in South Ossetia call elections are very far from real elections.Nothing but clownery, a farce and a redistribution of criminal power.\n United States\nThe United States denounced the elections \"as a step away from a peaceful and negotiated solution to the conflict\" and refused to \"recognize neither the legality nor the results.\" Russia\nAndrei Nesterenko, spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the election was judged by international observers to be free and compliant with international norms, and that the election is important for the further development and democratisation of South Ossetia. On comments offered by the European Union and the United States, Nesterenko stated: They neither recognize the result, nor want to see the real situation as it unfolds. This is an attempt to deprive the South Ossetian nation of the right to build its own life independently. Such statements from the promoters of democratic norms everywhere rather harm themselves.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Sweden at the 2012 Summer Olympics": "Sweden competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, from 25 July to 12 August 2012. Swedish athletes have competed at every edition of the Summer Olympic Games in the modern era, except for the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis. The Swedish Olympic Committee (Swedish: Sveriges Olympiska Kommitt\u00e9, SOK) sent a total of 134 athletes to the Games, 55 men and 79 women, to compete in 20 sports. For the second consecutive time in its Olympic history, Sweden was represented by more female than male athletes.\nSweden left London with a total of 8 Olympic medals (1 gold, 4 silver, and 3 bronze), tying with Tokyo and Atlanta for the overall highest medal count. Two medals each were awarded to athletes in sailing and wrestling, and one each in equestrian, handball, and triathlon. For the first time since 1992, Sweden won more than a single Olympic medal in Greco-Roman wrestling.\nAmong the nation's medalists were Star sailors Fredrik L\u00f6\u00f6f and Max Salminen, who together won Sweden's only gold medal in London, the nation's first in eight years. Lisa Nord\u00e9n, who finished eighteenth in Beijing, became the first Swedish athlete to win an Olympic medal in women's triathlon. Meanwhile, equestrian eventing rider Sara Algotsson Ostholt managed to win the nation's only silver medal in her sport. Sweden's team-based athletes also equalled their previous best Olympic results after 12 years, as they achieved a silver medal in men's handball. Several Swedish athletes narrowly missed out on the medal places in their events, including long jumper Michel Torn\u00e9us, singles sculls rower Lassi Karonen, swimmers Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Therese Alshammar, and sprint kayakers Sofia Paldanius and Anders Gustafsson.\n\n\n== Medalists ==\n\n\n== Delegation ==\nSveriges Olympiska Kommitt\u00e9 (SOK) selected a team of 134 athletes, 55 men and 79 women, to compete in 20 sports; it was the nation's fourteenth largest team sent to the Olympics outside the host nation. Handball and women's football were the only team-based sports in which Sweden had its representation in these Olympic games. There was only a single competitor in archery, badminton, mountain biking, judo, and triathlon. Sailing was the largest team by individual-based sport, with a total of 14 competitors. Sweden also marked its Olympic return in men's handball after a twelve-year absence.\nThe Swedish team featured past Olympic medalists, four of them from Beijing (road cyclists Gustav Larsson and Emma Johansson, sailor Fredrik L\u00f6\u00f6f in the Star class, and equestrian show jumper Rolf-G\u00f6ran Bengtsson, who competed at his fifth Olympics). For being the oldest and most experienced athlete, Bengtsson, at age 50, was Sweden's flag bearer at the opening ceremony. Table tennis player J\u00f6rgen Persson became the second Swedish athlete to compete in seven Olympic games, tying the record set by pistol shooter and former Olympic record holder Ragnar Skan\u00e5ker. Dressage rider Tinne Vilhelmsson-Silfv\u00e9n, and butterfly swimmer Lars Fr\u00f6lander, along with L\u00f6\u00f6f, competed at their sixth Olympics. Meanwhile, four other Swedish athletes made their fifth Olympic appearance, along with Bengtsson: equestrian eventing rider Linda Algotsson, freestyle swimmer Therese Alshammar, and sprint kayak pair and double Olympic medalists Henrik Nilsson and Markus Oscarsson. Gymnast Jonna Adlerteg, at age 17, was the youngest athlete of the team.\nOther notable Swedish athletes featured sprint kayaker and world champion Anders Gustafsson, butterfly swimmer and triple European champion Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, tennis doubles specialist Robert Lindstedt, triathlete and former World Series champion Lisa Nord\u00e9n, and equestrian eventing rider Sara Algotsson Ostholt, who made her Olympic comeback in London after a twelve-year absence.\n\n\n== Archery ==\n\n\n== Athletics ==\n\nSwedish athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the 'A' Standard, and 1 at the 'B' Standard):\nKeyNote \u2013 Ranks given for track events are within the athlete's heat only\nQ = Qualified for the next round\nq = Qualified for the next round as a fastest loser or, in field events, by position without achieving the qualifying target\nNR = National record\nN/A = Round not applicable for the event\nBye = Athlete not required to compete in roundMen\nField eventsWomen\nTrack & road eventsField eventsCombined events \u2013 Heptathlon\n\n\n== Badminton ==\n\n\n== Boxing ==\n\nAfter the 2012 European Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament, Sweden has qualified two boxers.

    "Brigitte Helm": "Brigitte Helm (born Brigitte Gisela Eva Schittenhelm, 17 March 1906 \u2013 11 June 1996) was a German actress, best remembered for her dual role as Maria and her double, the Maschinenmensch, in Fritz Lang's 1927 silent film Metropolis.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nBrigitte Gisela Eva Schittenhelm was born on 17 March 1908 in Berlin, the daughter of Gretchen Gertrud Martha Schittenhelm (n\u00e9e Tews) and Edwin Alexander Johannes Schittenhelm. Helm's first role was that of Maria in Metropolis which she began work on while only 18 years old. After Metropolis, Helm made over 30 other films, including talking pictures, before retiring in 1935. Her other appearances include The Love of Jeanne Ney (1927), Alraune (1928), L'Argent (1928), Gloria (1931), The Blue Danube (1932), L'Atlantide (1932), and Gold (1934). Helm was considered for the title role in Bride of Frankenstein before Elsa Lanchester was given the role.After a 10-year contract with UFA expired in 1935, Helm  married her second husband Dr. Hugo Kunheim, an industrialist. Helm was also involved in several traffic accidents, and was briefly imprisoned.  According to the Nazi Party's Press Chief Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Otto Dietrich's book The Hitler I Knew, Adolf Hitler saw that manslaughter charges against her from an automobile accident were dropped.Helm retired from films because she was \"disgusted with the Nazi takeover of the film industry\". In 1935, she moved to Switzerland where she had four children with Kunheim. In her later years, she refused to grant any interviews concerning her film career.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nMetropolis (1927), director: Fritz Lang\nAt the Edge of the World, (Am Rande der Welt, 1927), director: Karl Grune\nThe Love of Jeanne Ney (Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney , 1927), director: G.W.

    "Newgrounds": "Newgrounds is an entertainment website and company founded by Tom Fulp in 1995. It hosts user-generated content such as games, films, audio, and artwork composition in four respective website categories, and also provides visitor-driven voting and ranking of user-generated submissions. Fulp produces in-house content at the headquarters and offices in Glenside, Pennsylvania.In the 2000s and 2010s, Newgrounds played an important role in Internet culture and in independent video gaming in particular. Newgrounds has been called a \"distinct time in gaming history\", and a place \"where many animators and developers cut their teeth and gained a following long before social media was even a thing\".\n\n\n== Content ==\n\nUser-generated content can be uploaded and categorized into either one of the site's four web portals: Games, Movies, Audio, and Art. A Movie or Games submission entered undergoes the process termed \"judgment\", where it can be rated by all users (from 0 to 5 stars) and reviewed by other users. The average score calculated at various points during judgment determines if whether the content will be \"saved\" (added onto the database) or \"blammed\" (deleted with only its reviews saved in the \"Obituaries\" section).\nArt and Audio compositions are processed using a different method called \"scouting\". All users can put art and audio onto their own page, but only those that are \"scouted\" will appear in the public area. Like the judgment system, it stops stolen content, spam, or prohibited material reaching the public area, relying on users and site moderators. Once an individual is scouted, they are given the privilege to scout others.\n\nContent and context are liable to be reported for review to the moderators and staff members by flagging it for violations to the site's guidelines. A weighted system recognizes experienced users and gives their flag more voice. Newgrounds' homepage includes featured submissions from each category, as well as awards and honors to users whose submission that fall under the site's requirements to earn them. Members of Newgrounds also organize animations called \"collabs\" through the discussion forum on the site. Some scholars noted that while hundreds of these \"collabs\" are produced every year, only 20% are completed due to stress on those making the animations, while other scholars said that animators maintain a \"strong sense\" of authorship and ownership of what they produce, especially solo animators.Although the site hosted animations about Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and the Taliban, some scholars argued that the site has had a \"relatively balanced\" conversation on politics, even though those with right-wing views reflect a \"sizable part\" of the site's user base.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1991, at the age 13, Tom Fulp launched a Neo Geo fanzine called New Ground and sent issues to approximately 100 members of a club originating on the online service Prodigy. Using a hosting service, he launched a website called New Ground Remix in 1995, which increased in popularity during the summer of 1996 after Fulp created the BBS games Club a Seal and Assassin while a student at Drexel University. He then created Club a Seal II and Assassin II, along with a separate hosting site titled New Ground Atomix. The 1999 release of Pico's School, a Flash browser game that \"exhibited a complexity of design and polish in presentation that was virtually unseen in amateur Flash game development\" of the time helped establish Newgrounds as a \"public force.\"\nWhile Macromedia Flash Player was required for Newgrounds in order to play specific games, the site also brought together members who were interested in producing Flash games and gained \"considerable online influence\" as a result. As a result, it became one of the most \"active Flash creator communities in the English-speaking Internet\" and served as a place that game developers could begin their careers. Flash was once described by Newgrounds as the \"driving force\" behind the site. Even so, those on the site had a \"low tolerance for poor quality work\", referring mainly to humor and storytelling instead of animation quality. Some animators on the site moved to YouTube by the mid-2000s.By November 2008, Newgrounds had over 1.5 million users and over 130,000 animations. This had increased August 2010, when it was reported that the site had over 2.2 million users and over 180,000 games and animated films, most of which were animations made by only one person, with others collaboratively made by various individuals. It was also said in 2013 that users had created \"hundreds of thousands of animated movies and online games\".Time ranked the website at No. 39 on its list of \"50 Best Websites\" list in 2010.In 2018, Newgrounds began to encourage contributors to submit their games in a HTML5 format rather than Flash. In November and December, it experienced surges of new members originally from Tumblr when that site began restricting adult content after illegal child pornography was found on it, resulting in the Tumblr iOS app being removed from the App Store.In summer 2019, the administration of Newgrounds unveiled the Newgrounds Player, which some describe as a \"solution for playing Flash games and movies\" hosted on the site.In April 2021, an additional week for the browser game Friday Night Funkin', centering around the theme of Tankmen, was exclusively released on Newgrounds, causing the site's server to become overloaded after an influx of site traffic.In July 2021, Fulp received the Game Developers Choice Awards Pioneer Award for his contributions to establishing Newgrounds and subsequent work in The Behemoth.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nKurt, Luther; Caine, Kelly; Zigler, Kevin; Bruckman, Amy (November 2010). \"Why It Works (When It Works): Success Factors in Online Creative Collaboration\".

    "Religious tolerance": "Religious toleration may signify \"no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful\". Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of minority and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant state religion.  However, religion is also sociological, and the practice of toleration has always had a political aspect as well.:\u200axiii\u200aAn overview of the history of toleration and different cultures in which toleration has been practiced, and the ways in which such a paradoxical concept has developed into a guiding one, illuminates its contemporary use as political, social, religious, and ethnic, applying to LGBT individuals and other minorities, and other connected concepts such as human rights.\n\n\n== In antiquity ==\n\nReligious toleration has been described as a \"remarkable feature\" of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia.  Cyrus the Great assisted in the restoration of the sacred places of various cities. In the Old Testament, Cyrus was said to have released the Jews from the Babylonian captivity in 539\u2013530 BCE, and permitted their return to their homeland.The Hellenistic city of Alexandria, founded 331 BCE, contained a large Jewish community which lived in peace with equivalently sized Greek and Egyptian populations. According to Michael Walzer, the city provided \"a useful example of what we might think of as the imperial version of multiculturalism.\"Before Christianity became the state church of the Roman Empire, it encouraged conquered peoples to continue worshipping their own gods. \"An important part of Roman propaganda was its invitation to the gods of conquered territories to enjoy the benefits of worship within the imperium.\" Christians were singled out for persecution because of their own rejection of Roman pantheism and refusal to honor the emperor as a god. In 311 CE, Roman Emperor Galerius issued a general edict of toleration of Christianity, in his own name and in those of Licinius and Constantine I (who converted to Christianity the following year).\n\n\n== Buddhism ==\n\nBuddhists have shown significant tolerance for other religions:Buddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching, and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious forms.\nJames Freeman Clarke said in Ten Great Religions (1871):The Buddhists have founded no Inquisition; they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our Western experience.\nThe Edicts of Ashoka issued by King Ashoka the Great (269\u2013231 BCE), a Buddhist, declared ethnic and religious tolerance. His Edict in the 12th main stone writing of Girnar on the third century BCE which state that \"Kings accepted religious tolerance and that Emperor Ashoka maintained that no one would consider his / her is to be superior to other and rather would follow a path of unity by accuring the essence of other religions\".However, Buddhism has also had  controversies regarding toleration. In addition, the question of possible intolerance among Buddhists in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, primarily against Muslims,  has been raised by Paul Fuller.\n\n\n== Christianity ==\n\nThe books of Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy make similar statements about the treatment of strangers. For example, Exodus 22:21 says: \"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt\". These texts are frequently used in sermons to plead for compassion and tolerance of those who are different from us and less powerful. Julia Kristeva elucidated a philosophy of political and religious toleration based on all of our mutual identities as strangers.The New Testament Parable of the Tares, which speaks of the difficulty of distinguishing wheat from weeds before harvest time, has also been invoked in support of religious toleration. In his \"Letter to Bishop Roger of Chalons\", Bishop Wazo of Liege (c. 985\u20131048) relied on the parable to argue that \"the church should let dissent grow with orthodoxy until the Lord comes to separate and judge them\".Roger Williams used this parable to support government toleration of all of the \"weeds\" (heretics) in the world, because civil persecution often inadvertently hurts the \"wheat\" (believers) too. Instead, Williams believed it was God's duty to judge in the end, not man's. This parable lent further support to Williams' belief in a wall of separation between church and state as described in his 1644 book, The Bloody Tenent of Persecution.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the Middle Ages, there were instances of toleration of particular groups. The Latin concept tolerantia was a \"highly-developed political and judicial concept in medieval scholastic theology and canon law.\" Tolerantia was used to \"denote the self-restraint of a civil power in the face of\" outsiders, like infidels, Muslims or Jews, but also in the face of social groups like prostitutes and lepers. Heretics such as the Cathari, Waldensians, Jan Hus, and his followers, the Hussites, were persecuted. Later theologians belonging or reacting to the Protestant Reformation began discussion of the circumstances under which dissenting religious thought should be permitted. Toleration \"as a government-sanctioned practice\" in Christian countries, \"the sense on which most discussion of the phenomenon relies\u2014is not attested before the sixteenth century\".\n\n\n==== Unam sanctam and Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus ====\nCenturies of Roman Catholic intoleration of other faiths was exemplified by Unam sanctam, a papal bull issued by Pope Boniface VIII on 18 November 1302. The bull laid down dogmatic propositions on the unity of the Catholic Church, the necessity of belonging to it for eternal salvation (Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus), the position of the Pope as supreme head of the Church, and the duty thence arising of submission to the Pope in order to belong to the Church and thus to attain salvation. The bull ends, \"Furthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\"\n\n\n==== Tolerance of the Jews ====\n\nIn Poland in 1264, the Statute of Kalisz was issued, guaranteeing freedom of religion for the Jews in the country.\n\nIn 1348, Pope Clement VI (1291\u20131352) issued a bull pleading with Catholics not to murder Jews, whom they blamed for the Black Death. He noted that Jews died of the plague like anyone else, and that the disease also flourished in areas where there were no Jews. Christians who blamed and killed Jews had been \"seduced by that liar, the Devil\". He took Jews under his personal protection at Avignon, but his calls for other clergy to do so failed to be heeded.Johann Reuchlin (1455\u20131522) was a German humanist and a scholar of Greek and Hebrew who opposed efforts by Johannes Pfefferkorn, backed by the Dominicans of Cologne, to confiscate all religious texts from the Jews as a first step towards their forcible conversion to the Catholic religion.Despite occasional spontaneous episodes of pogroms and killings, as during the Black Death, Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was a relatively tolerant home for the Jews in the medieval period. In 1264, the Statute of Kalisz guaranteed safety, personal liberties, freedom of religion, trade, and travel to Jews. By the mid-16th century, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was home to 80% of the world's Jewish population. Jewish worship was officially recognized, with a Chief Rabbi originally appointed by the monarch. Jewish property ownership was also protected for much of the period, and Jews entered into business partnerships with members of the nobility.\n\n\n==== Vladimiri ====\nPaulus Vladimiri (c. 1370\u20131435) was a Polish scholar and rector who at the Council of Constance in 1414, presented a thesis, Tractatus de potestate papae et respectu infidelium (Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels). In it he argued that pagan and Christian nations could coexist in peace and criticized the Teutonic Order for its wars of conquest of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania. Vladimiri strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations\u2014a forerunner of modern theories of human rights. Throughout his political, diplomatic and university career, he expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands.\n\n\n==== Erasmus ====\n\nDesiderius Erasmus Roterodamus (1466\u20131536), was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and Catholic whose works laid a foundation for religious toleration. For example, in De libero arbitrio, opposing certain views of Martin Luther, Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, \"because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived.\" Gary Remer writes, \"Like Cicero, Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors.\" Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, \"It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him.\"\n\n\n==== More ====\nSaint Thomas More (1478\u20131535), Catholic Lord Chancellor of King Henry VIII and author, described a world of almost complete religious toleration in Utopia (1516), in which the Utopians \"can hold various religious beliefs without persecution from the authorities.\" However, More's work is subject to various interpretations, and it is not clear that he felt that earthly society should be conducted the same way as in Utopia. Thus, in his three years as Lord Chancellor, More actively approved of the persecution of those who sought to undermine the Catholic faith in England.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\nAt the Diet of Worms (1521), Martin Luther refused to recant his beliefs citing freedom of conscience as his justification. According to Historian Hermann August Winkler, the individual's freedom of conscience became the hallmark of Protestantism. Luther was convinced that faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit and could therefore not be forced on a person. Heresies could not be met with force, but with preaching the gospel revealed in the Bible. Luther: \"Heretics should not be overcome with fire, but with written sermons.\" In Luther's view, the worldly authorities were entitled to expel heretics. Only if they undermine the public order, should they be executed. Later proponents of tolerance such as Sebastian Franck and Sebastian Castellio cited Luther's position. He had overcome, at least for the Protestant territories and countries, the violent medieval criminal procedures of dealing with heretics. But Luther remained rooted in the Middle Ages insofar as he considered the Anabaptists' refusal to take oaths, do military service, and the rejection of private property by some Anabaptist groups to be a political threat to the public order which would inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos. So Anabaptists were persecuted not only in Catholic but also in Lutheran and Reformed territories. However, a number of Protestant theologians such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, and Johannes Brenz as well as Landgrave Philip of Hesse opposed the execution of Anabaptists. Ulrich Zwingli demanded the expulsion of persons who did not accept the Reformed beliefs, in some cases the execution of Anabaptist leaders. The young Michael Servetus also defended tolerance since 1531, in his letters to Johannes Oecolampadius, but during those years some Protestant theologians such as Bucer and Capito publicly expressed they thought he should be persecuted.  The trial against Servetus, an Antitrinitarian, in Geneva was not a case of church discipline but a criminal procedure based on the legal code of the Holy Roman Empire. Denying the Trinity doctrine was long considered to be the same as atheism in all churches. The Anabaptists made a considerable contribution to the development of tolerance in the early-modern era by incessantly demanding freedom of conscience and standing up for it with their patient suffering.\n\n\n==== Castellio ====\n\nSebastian Castellio (1515\u20131563) was a French Protestant theologian who in 1554 published under a pseudonym the pamphlet Whether heretics should be persecuted (De haereticis, an sint persequendi) criticizing John Calvin's execution of Michael Servetus: \"When Servetus fought with reasons and writings, he should have been repulsed by reasons and writings.\" Castellio concluded: \"We can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance. Even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time, we can at any rate come to general understandings, can love one another, and can enter the bonds of peace, pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith.\" Castellio is remembered for the often quoted statement, \"To kill a man is not to protect a doctrine, but it is to kill a man.\n\n\n==== Bodin ====\nJean Bodin (1530\u20131596) was a French Catholic jurist and political philosopher. His Latin work Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis (\"The Colloqium of the Seven\") portrays a conversation about the nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds: a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic. All agree to live in mutual respect and tolerance.\n\n\n==== Montaigne ====\nMichel de Montaigne (1533\u20131592), French Catholic essayist and statesman, moderated between the Catholic and Protestant sides in the Wars of Religion. Montaigne's theory of skepticism led to the conclusion that we cannot precipitously decide the error of others' views. Montaigne wrote in his famous \"Essais\": \"It is putting a very high value on one's conjectures, to have a man roasted alive because of them...To kill people, there must be sharp and brilliant clarity.\"\n\n\n==== Edict of Torda ====\n\nIn 1568, King John II Sigismund of Hungary, encouraged by his Unitarian Minister Francis David (D\u00e1vid Ferenc), issued the Edict of Torda decreeing religious toleration.\n\n\n==== Maximilian II ====\nIn 1571, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian II granted religious toleration to the nobles of Lower Austria, their families and workers.\n\n\n==== The Warsaw Confederation, 1573 ====\n\nThe Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th centuries, however complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573 in the Warsaw Confederation. The Commonwealth kept religious-freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.The Warsaw Confederation was a private compact signed by representatives of all the major religions in Polish and Lithuanian society, in which they pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. The confederation was incorporated into the Henrican articles, which constituted a virtual Polish\u2013Lithuanian constitution.\n\n\n==== Edict of Nantes ====\nThe Edict of Nantes, issued on April 13, 1598, by Henry IV of France, granted Protestants\u2014notably Calvinist Huguenots\u2014substantial rights in a nation where Catholicism was the state religion. The main concern was civil unity\u2014the edict separated civil law from religious rights, treated non-Catholics as more than mere schismatics and heretics for the first time, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king. The edict marked the end of the religious wars in France that tore apart the population during the second half of the 16th century.\nThe Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685 by King Louis XIV with the Edict of Fontainebleau, leading to renewed persecution of Protestants in France. Although strict enforcement of the revocation was relaxed during the reign of Louis XV, it was not until 102 years later, in 1787, when Louis XVI signed the Edict of Versailles\u2014known as the Edict of Tolerance\u2014that civil status and rights to form congregations by Protestants were restored.\n\n\n=== The Enlightenment ===\nBeginning in the Enlightenment commencing in the 1600s, politicians and commentators began formulating theories of religious toleration and basing legal codes on the concept. A distinction began to develop between civil tolerance, concerned with \"the policy of the state towards religious dissent\"., and ecclesiastical tolerance, concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.\n\n\n==== Milton ====\n\nJohn Milton (1608\u20131674), English Protestant poet and essayist, called in the Areopagitica for \"the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties\" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or even Catholics). \"Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel.\"\n\n\n==== Rudolph II ====\nIn 1609, Rudolph II decreed religious toleration in Bohemia.\n\n\n==== In the American colonies ====\n\nIn 1636, Roger Williams and companions at the foundation of Rhode Island entered into a compact binding themselves \"to be obedient to the majority only in civil things\". Williams spoke of \"democracie or popular government.\" Lucian Johnston writes, \"Williams' intention was to grant an infinitely greater religious liberty than what existed anywhere in the world outside of the Colony of Maryland.\" In 1663, Charles II granted the colony a charter guaranteeing complete religious toleration.Also in 1636, Congregationalist Thomas Hooker and a group of companions founded Connecticut. They combined the democratic form of government that had been developed by the Separatist Congregationalists in Plymouth Colony (Pilgrim Fathers) with unlimited freedom of conscience. Like Martin Luther, Hooker argued that as faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit it could not be forced on a person.\n\nIn 1649 Maryland passed the Maryland Toleration Act, also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians only (excluding Nontrinitarian faiths). Passed on September 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The Calvert family sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and some of the other denominations that did not conform to the dominant Anglicanism of England and her colonies.\nIn 1657, New Amsterdam, governed by Dutch Calvinists, granted religious toleration to Jews. They had fled from Portuguese persecution in Brazil.In the Province of Pennsylvania, William Penn and his fellow Quakers heavily imprinted their religious values of toleration on the Pennsylvania government. The Pennsylvania 1701 Charter of Privileges extended religious freedom to all monotheists, and government was open to all Christians.\n\n\n==== Spinoza ====\n\nBaruch Spinoza (1632\u20131677) was a Dutch Jewish philosopher. He published the Theological-Political Treatise anonymously in 1670, arguing (according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) that \"the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted without injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that the peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the suppression of this freedom\", and defending, \"as a political ideal, the tolerant, secular, and democratic polity\". After interpreting certain Biblical texts, Spinoza opted for tolerance and freedom of thought in his conclusion that \"every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction.\"\n\n\n==== Locke ====\nEnglish philosopher John Locke (1632\u20131704) published A Letter Concerning Toleration in 1689. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer.\nUnlike Thomas Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argued that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. In his opinion, civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. However, Locke denies religious tolerance for Catholics, for political reasons, and also for atheists because \"Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist\". A passage Locke later added to An Essay Concerning Human Understanding questioned whether atheism was necessarily inimical to political obedience.\n\n\n==== Bayle ====\n\nPierre Bayle (1647\u20131706) was a French Protestant scholar and philosopher who went into exile in Holland. In his \"Dictionnaire Historique et Critique\" and \"Commentaire Philosophique\" he advanced arguments for religious toleration (though, like some others of his time, he was not anxious to extend the same protection to Catholics he would to differing Protestant sects). Among his arguments were that every church believes it is the right one so \"a heretical church would be in a position to persecute the true church\". Bayle wrote that \"the erroneous conscience procures for error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience procures for truth.\"Bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: \"One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel.\" He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state, but to the contrary: \"If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution. In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it.\"\n\n\n==== Toleration Act 1688 ====\nThe Toleration Act 1688 adopted by the English Parliament allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation. The Nonconformists were Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists. They were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance. The Act, however, did not apply to Catholics and non-trinitarians, and continued the existing social and political disabilities for Dissenters, including their exclusion from political office and from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\n\n==== Voltaire ====\n\nFran\u00e7ois-Marie Arouet, the French writer, historian and philosopher known as Voltaire (1694\u20131778) published his Treatise on Toleration in 1763. In it he attacked religious views, but also said, \"It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?\" On the other hand, Voltaire in his writings on religion was spiteful and intolerant of the practice of the Christian religion, and  Orthodox rabbi Joseph Telushkin has claimed that the most significant of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire.\n\n\n==== Lessing ====\nGotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729\u20131781), German dramatist and philosopher, trusted in a \"Christianity of Reason\", in which human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by divine revelation. His plays about Jewish characters and themes, such as \"Die Juden\" and \"Nathan der Weise\", \"have usually been considered impressive pleas for social and religious toleration\". The latter work contains the famous parable of the three rings, in which three sons represent the three Abrahamic religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Each son believes he has the one true ring passed down by their father, but judgment on which is correct is reserved to God.\n\n\n==== Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen ====\n\nThe Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789), adopted by the National Constituent Assembly during the French Revolution, states in Article 10: \"No-one shall be interfered with for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their practice does not disturb public order as established by the law.\" (\"Nul ne doit \u00eatre inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 pour ses opinions, m\u00eames religieuses, pourvu que leur manifestation ne trouble pas l'ordre public \u00e9tabli par la loi.\")\n\n\n==== The First Amendment to the United States Constitution ====\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution, ratified along with the rest of the Bill of Rights on December 15, 1791, included the following words: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...\"\nIn 1802, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the Danbury Baptists Association in which he said:\n\"...I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church & State.\"\n\n\n=== In the nineteenth century ===\nThe process of legislating religious toleration went unevenly forward, while philosophers continued to discuss the underlying rationale.\n\n\n==== Roman Catholic Relief Act ====\nThe Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 adopted by the Parliament in 1829 repealed the last of the criminal laws (TEST ACTS) aimed at Catholic citizens of Great Britain.\n\n\n==== Mill ====\nJohn Stuart Mill's arguments in \"On Liberty\" (1859) in support of the freedom of speech were phrased to include a defense of religious toleration:\n\n Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question for others, without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions.\n\n\n==== Syllabus of Errors ====\nThe Syllabus of Errors was issued by Pope Pius IX in 1864.  It condemns 80 errors or heresies, including the following propositions regarding religious toleration:\n\n 77. In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship.  78. Hence it has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship. 79. Moreover, it is false that the civil liberty of every form of worship, and the full power, given to all, of overtly and publicly manifesting any opinions whatsoever and thoughts, conduce more easily to corrupt the morals and minds of the people, and to propagate the pest of indifferentism.\n\n\n==== Renan ====\n\nIn his 1882 essay \"What is a Nation?\", French historian and philosopher Ernest Renan proposed a definition of nationhood based on \"a spiritual principle\" involving shared memories, rather than a common religious, racial or linguistic heritage. Thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the life of the nation. \"You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion\".\n\n\n=== In the twentieth century ===\nIn 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:\n\n Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance\nEven though not formally legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or influenced many national constitutions since 1948. It also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international, regional, national and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights including the freedom of religion.\nIn 1965, the Catholic Vatican II Council issued the decree Dignitatis humanae (Religious Freedom) that states that all people must have the right to religious freedom.  The Catholic 1983 Code of Canon Law states:\n\nCan. 748 \u00a71. All persons are bound to seek the truth in those things which regard God and his Church and by virtue of divine law are bound by the obligation and possess the right of embracing and observing the truth which they have come to know. \u00a72. No one is ever permitted to coerce persons to embrace the Catholic faith against their conscience.\nIn 1986, the first World Day of Prayer for Peace was held in Assisi. Representatives of one hundred and twenty different religions came together for prayer.In 1988, in the spirit of Glasnost, Soviet general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev promised increased religious toleration.\n\n\n== Hinduism ==\nThe Rigveda says Ekam Sath Viprah Bahudha Vadanti which translates to \"The truth is One, but sages call it by different Names\". Consistent with this tradition, India chose to be a secular country even though it was divided partitioning on religious lines. Whatever intolerance Hindu scholars displayed towards other religions was subtle and symbolic and most likely was done to present a superior argument in defence of their own faith. Traditionally, Hindus showed their intolerance by withdrawing and avoiding contact with those whom they held in contempt, instead of using violence and aggression to strike fear in their hearts. Another example of religious intolerance displayed by Hindus can be drawn from the events of 1947 massacre of Muslim population of Jammu and Kashmir under the Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh.\nPluralism and tolerance of diversity are built into Hindu theology India's long history is a testimony to its tolerance of religious diversity. Christianity came to India with St. Thomas in the first century CE, long before it became popular in the West. Judaism came to India after the Jewish temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE and the Jews were expelled from their homeland. In a recent book titled \"Who are the Jews of India?\" (University of California Press, 2000), author Nathan Katz observes that India is the only country where the Jews were not persecuted. The Indian chapter is one of the happiest of the Jewish Diaspora. Both Christians and Jews have existed in a predominant Hindu India for centuries without being persecuted. Zoroastrians from Persia (present day Iran) entered India in the 7th century to flee Islamic conquest. They are known as Parsis in India. The Parsis are an affluent community in the city of Mumbai. Once treated as foreigners, they remain a minority community, yet still housing the richest business families in India; for example, the Tata family controls a huge industrial empire in various parts of the country. Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the powerful Prime Minister of India (1966\u201377; 1980\u201384), was married to Feroz Gandhi, a Parsi (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi).\n\n\n== Islam ==\n\nThe Quran, albeit having given importance to its 'true believers', commands its followers to tolerate 'the people of all faiths and communities' and to let them command their dignity, without breaking the Shariah law.\nCertain verses of the Quran were interpreted to create a specially tolerated status for People of the Book, Jewish and Christian believers in the Old and New Testaments considered to have been a basis for Islamic religion:\n\nVerily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.\nUnder Islamic law, Jews and Christians were considered dhimmis, a legal status inferior to that of a Muslim but superior to that of other non-Muslims.\nJewish communities in the Ottoman Empire held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion, as did Christians, though both were subject to additional restrictions, such as restrictions on the areas where they could live or work or in clothing, and both had to pay additional taxes. Yitzhak Sarfati, born in Germany, became the Chief Rabbi of Edirne and wrote a letter inviting European Jews to settle in the Ottoman Empire, in which he asked: \"Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than under Christians?'\". Sultan Beyazid II (1481\u20131512), issued a formal invitation to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain and Portugal, leading to a wave of Jewish immigration.\nAccording to Michael Walzer:\n\nThe established religion of the [Ottoman] empire was Islam, but three other religious communities\u2014Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Jewish\u2014were permitted to form autonomous organizations. These three were equal among themselves, without regard to their relative numerical strength. They were subject to the same restrictions vis-\u00e0-vis Muslims\u2014with regard to dress, proselytizing, and intermarriage, for example\u2014and were allowed the same legal control over their own members.\n\n\n== Judaism ==\n\n\n== Modern analyses and critiques ==\nContemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of suttee (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the Mormon practice of polygamy. The French head scarf controversy represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal. Toleration of the Romani people in European countries is a continuing issue.\n\n\n=== Modern definition ===\nHistorian Alexandra Walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word \"toleration\" may be very different from its historic meaning. Toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or libertarian view of human rights. Hans Oberdiek writes, \"As long as no one is harmed or no one's fundamental rights are violated, the state should keep hands off, tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting, deplorable or even debased. This for a long time has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals... It is found, for example, in the writings of American philosophers John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Ronald Dworkin, Brian Barry, and a Canadian, Will Kymlicka, among others.\"Isaiah Berlin attributes to Herbert Butterfield the notion that \"toleration... implies a certain disrespect. I tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts, though I know them to be absurd and foolish. Mill would, I think, have agreed.\"John Gray states that \"When we tolerate a practice, a belief or a character trait, we let something be that we judge to be undesirable, false or at least inferior; our toleration expresses the conviction that, despite its badness, the object of toleration should be left alone.\" However, according to Gray, \"new liberalism\u2014the\nliberalism of Rawls, Dworkin, Ackerman and suchlike\" seems to imply that \"it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of, or against, any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good\".\n\n\n=== Tolerating the intolerant ===\n\nWalzer, Karl Popper and John Rawls have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance. Walzer asks \"Should we tolerate the intolerant?\" He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects. Rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society. He links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society, in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will, over time, acquire the tolerance of the wider society.\n\n\n=== Other criticisms and issues ===\nToleration has been described as undermining itself via moral relativism: \"either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it. If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good.\"Ronald Dworkin argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society. Dworkin has also questioned whether the United States is a \"tolerant secular\" nation, or is re-characterizing itself as a \"tolerant religious\" nation, based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics. Dworkin concludes that \"the tolerant secular model is preferable, although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model.\"In The End of Faith, Sam Harris asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity, especially beliefs which promote violence.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnekantavada\nA Critique of Pure Tolerance\nFreedom From Religion Foundation\nFreedom of religion\nFreedom of religion by country\nHistory of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance\nIslam and other religions\nMultifaith space\nOntario Consultants on Religious Tolerance\nReligious discrimination\nReligious intolerance\nReligious liberty\nReligious persecution\nReligious pluralism\nSecular state\nSeparation of church and state\n\n\n== Sources ==\n This article incorporates text from a free content work.

    "Heather Wilde": "Heather Wilde is an English actress who was active in stage and screen productions in both England and the United States between the late 1930s and 1950s. In films she was often cast in small uncredited roles. Wilde is perhaps best known today for her performances as a supporting character in two popular, critically acclaimed American comedies: as the primping little actress Miss Plupp in The Bank Dick (1940) starring W. C. Fields and as the anxious housemaid Annie in Life with Father (1947) starring William Powell and Irene Dunne.\n\n\n== Stage and film ==\nIn its December 8, 1940 issue, The Philadelphia Inquirer carries a news item that provides some background information on Wilde:Heather Wilde, English actress, is making her American screen debut in \"The Bank Dick\" now at the Earle [Theatre]. She has been but a short time in America. Previously she had four years experience on the English stage and screen. To the fact she stands but 4 feet, 11 inches in her stocking feet Miss Wilde owes her first American studio engagement. She was chosen for the current role because the character was supposed to be very diminutive. In the sequences in \"The Bank Dick\" of a motion picture within the picture, Miss Wilde is seen as an actress playing opposite 6-foot, 2-inch Reed Hadley. The sequence is played for comedy, with W. C. Fields as a film director.\n\n\n== Selected filmography ==\nThe Divorce of Lady X (1938): Maid (uncredited)\nThe Bank Dick (1940): Miss Plupp\nConfirm or Deny (1941): Telephone operator (uncredited)\nEagle Squadron (1942): WAAF member (uncredited)\nCounter-Espionage (1942): Gertie Barrow (uncredited)\nThe Undying Monster (1942): Millie (uncredited)\nSherlock Holmes Faces Death (1943): Jenny (uncredited)\nThe Lodger (1944): Mary Bowles (uncredited)\nKitty (1945): Lil\nThe Imperfect Lady (1947): maid (uncredited)\nLife with Father (1947): Annie\nThe Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947): maid (uncredited)\nThe Lone Wolf in London (1947): maid (uncredited)\nFighter Squadron (1948): Corine (uncredited)\nThe Fighting O'Flynn (1949): barmaid (uncredited)\nLast Holiday (1950): Maggie\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHeather Wilde at IMDb",

    "Newport Pagnell services": "Newport Pagnell is a town and civil parish in the Borough of Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, England.  The Office for National Statistics records Newport Pagnell as part of the Milton Keynes urban area.It is separated from the rest of the urban area by the M1 motorway, on which Newport Pagnell Services, the second service station to be opened in the United Kingdom, is located. \nThe town is more widely known for having the only remaining vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom, and being the original home of the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe town was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Neuport, Old English for 'New Market Town', but by that time, the old Anglo-Saxon town was dominated by the Norman invaders. The suffix 'Pagnell' came later when the manor passed into the hands of the Pagnell (Paynel) family. It was the principal town of the \"Three Hundreds of Newport\", a district that had almost the same boundary as the modern Borough.\nAt one time, Newport Pagnell was one of the largest towns in the County of Buckinghamshire (the assizes of the County were occasionally held there). Today, despite its own substantial expansion, it has been completely dwarfed by the growth of Milton Keynes. There were also at one time two hospitals in Newport Pagnell, and six fairs were held for the townsfolk throughout the year.The 1841 census gave the population as 3,569.Newport Pagnell became the headquarters of Newport Pagnell Rural District under the Local Government Act 1894. In 1897, Newport Pagnell became the sole civil parish comprising the newly created Newport Pagnell Urban District.\nThe Grade I listed Tickford Bridge, over the River Ouzel (or Lovat), was built in 1810. It is one of just a few cast iron bridges in Britain that still carry modern road traffic. Near the footbridge at the side, there is a plaque placed by Newport Pagnell Historical Society that gives details of its history and construction. The Ouzel joins the Great Ouse nearby, and a large set of sluice gates, used to control downstream flooding, is located near the bridge.\nBetween 1817 and 1864, the town was linked to the Grand Junction Canal at Great Linford via the Newport Pagnell Canal. In 1862, the canal owners sold the route to the London and North Western Railway. For a hundred years (1867 to 1967), Newport Pagnell was served by Newport Pagnell railway station, the terminus on the Wolverton to Newport Pagnell branch line.\nFrom 1954 until 2007, the town was the home to the exclusive sports car manufacturer Aston Martin. The Newport Pagnell factory was considered outdated and a new production facility was built near Gaydon in Warwickshire. There is still a service facility in Newport Pagnell, but the factory on the north side of Tickford St has since been demolished apart from the engine shop, board room and offices that are listed buildings. The land behind these has been purchased by Tesco and the supermarket giant had planned to build an outlet on the site, preserving the original remaining buildings for use by the townspeople: as of May 2019, this plan remains on the drawing board. In 2012, Aston Martin completely modernised the service facility and the site also houses a bespoke sales department.\nNotable industries in the town include the only remaining vellum manufacturer in the United Kingdom, William Cowley, located at Parchment Works, 97 Caldecote Street.Over the past 50 years, Newport Pagnell has attracted an increasing amount of investment and  of economic growth, due to its fortunes being intertwined with the growth of Milton Keynes. This has led to a number of new housing developments in the area.The modern civil parish of Newport Pagnell stops at the M1, but the ecclesiastical parish extends to include Broughton and Caldecote. The parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe town is home to four primary schools - Tickford Park Primary School, Cedars, Green Park Primary School, and Portfields Primary School - and three pre-schools - River Meadows, Lovat Hall and Northern Pastures. It is also home to one of two campuses of Ousedale School (the other one being in nearby Olney), which serves students from across the town and its surrounding villages, and is one of the best performing secondary schools in the Borough of Milton Keynes.\n\n\n== Location and transport ==\nThe town is located at the north-eastern corner of the Milton Keynes urban area, and straddles the urban and rural parts of the Borough. It is served by the M1 motorway from Junction 14 (2 miles (3.2 km) to the south) via the A509 which, along with the A422 and Wolverton Road, connects it with Milton Keynes proper. To the east of the town, the A422 and A509 multiplex northwards to form the Newport Pagnell Eastern Bypass, providing links to Bedford, Wellingborough and Kettering.  The historic Newport Pagnell-Northampton road (B526) runs through the centre of the town, linking rural villages to the north, and provides a secondary route to Northampton.\nIn February 2021, developers presented to Milton Keynes Council proposals for the development of a new community to the south of Newport Pagnell, with the construction of approximately 5,000 homes. In planning documents, the new area is called \"Milton Keynes East\", and is proposed to include a local centre with two primary schools and a secondary school. It is to have direct road links to Newport Pagnell town centre, and Central Milton Keynes via an expansion of the Milton Keynes grid road system. If  undertaken, it will be the first major expansion of Milton Keynes to the east of the M1. \nIt was proposed in January 2021 that, with the money that had been given to Milton Keynes Council as part of the UK Government's Active Travel Fund, Tongwell Lane in Newport Pagnell would be converted into a redway, which would better link the town with the Milton Keynes designated area.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nAlthough Newport Pagnell was excluded from the 1967 designated area of Milton Keynes, its growth has been at a similar level to that of the constituent towns of the latter; the two now join at the M1 and there are no other practical distinctions between them. The Office for National Statistics records Newport Pagnell as part of the Milton Keynes Urban Area. Its population in 1971 was 6,000: by 2001 it had reached 15,020, In 2006, the Borough Council projected that the population will remain broadly stable at this level. However, in its comments on the expansion plans for Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire County Council challenged this assumption, calling for any further expansion to be to the east of the M1 rather than south across the border into Aylesbury Vale. At the 2011 census, the population had reached 15,118.\n\n\n== Sport and leisure ==\nNewport Pagnell has a Non-League football team Newport Pagnell Town F.C., nicknamed the Swans, who play at The Pavilion on Willen Road. An ITF Taekwon-Do club, Kicks Taekwon-Do Academy, trains at Cedars Primary School, Bury Street, and a swimming pool. Between 1959-1960 it was the headquarters of the Aston Martin F1 team.\n\n\n=== Newport Pagnell Lawn Bowls ===\nBowls has been played in Newport Pagnell for over 400 years as maps of the Town dating from the mid 17 Century show a public House called \u201cThe Bowling Green\u201d. The Newport Pagnell Bowling Club was founded in 1905 and the club used the Bowling Green behind the George pub in Tickford Street (currently The Magic Wok 2019). The game was developing locally due to the Railways, with clubs at Wolverton existing already and Olney forming in 1906. After the Great War, the Club purchased a plot of land known as \u201cThe Bully\u201d and the Club remains at this site in Castle Meadow to the current day.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nFrancis Annesley, 1st Viscount Valentia, was born in Newport Pagnell.\nNigel Benson, the author, was born in Newport Pagnell.\nSteve Brooker, footballer, was born in Newport Pagnell.\nHenry Bull (1843\u20131905), cricketer, was born at Newport Pagnell.\nWilliam Bull (1738\u20131814) (born Irthlingborough) was minister to the Independent Church, now United Reformed Church.\nLetitia Dean went to Cedars School in the town.\nKelly George, actor and star of BBC children's television series Grange Hill, lived and was educated in the town.\nRichard Hopkins, the television producer, was born in Newport Pagnell.\nLawrence Humphrey,  (or Laurence Humfrey) DD (1527? \u2013 1 February 1590) English theologian, President of Magdalen College, Oxford, and Dean successively of Gloucester and Winchester.\nRichard Meredith, author, lives in Newport Pagnell.\nGordon Moakes, bassist of Indie band Bloc Party, was educated in Newport Pagnell.\nJames Nash, World Touring Car Championship driver, lives in Newport Pagnell.\nNiko B (born 2000), YouTuber and rapper, lives in Newport Pagnell.\nDavid Oldfield who played for Leicester City, Stoke City and Oxford United, lived in Newport Pagnell.\nCharles Sanford Terry, the historian, musicologist and authority on J.

    "Yhc": "Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis and one of at least 113 total cannabinoids identified in the plant.  Although the chemical formula for THC (C21H30O2) describes multiple isomers, the term THC usually refers to the Delta-9-THC isomer with chemical name (\u2212)-trans-\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol. Like most pharmacologically active secondary metabolites of plants, THC is a lipid found in cannabis, assumed to be involved in the plant's evolutionary adaptation, putatively against insect predation, ultraviolet light, and environmental stress.THC, along with its double bond isomers and their stereoisomers, is one of only three cannabinoids scheduled by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III. Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act for having \"no accepted medical use\" and \"lack of accepted safety\". However, dronabinol, a pharmaceutical form of THC, has been approved by the FDA as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an antiemetic for people receiving chemotherapy under the trade names Marinol and Syndros. The pharmaceutical formulation dronabinol is an oily and viscous resin provided in capsules available by prescription in the United States, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand.Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u03949-THC), better known as THC, is the marijuana plant's primary component for causing psychoactive effects. THC was first discovered and isolated by Bulgarian-born chemist Raphael Mechoulam in Israel in 1964. It was found that, when smoked, tetrahydrocannabinol is absorbed into the bloodstream and travels to the brain, attaching itself to the naturally-occurring endocannabinoid receptors located in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. These are the parts of the brain responsible for thinking, memory, pleasure, coordination and movement.\n\n\n== Medical uses ==\n\nTHC is an active ingredient in Nabiximols, a specific extract of Cannabis that was approved as a botanical drug in the United Kingdom in 2010 as a mouth spray for people with multiple sclerosis to alleviate neuropathic pain, spasticity, overactive bladder, and other symptoms. Nabiximols (as Sativex) is available as a prescription drug in Canada. In 2021, Nabiximols was approved for medical use in Ukraine.\n\n\n== Pharmacology ==\n\n\n=== Mechanism of action ===\n\nThe actions of Delta-9-THC result from its partial agonist activity at the cannabinoid receptor CB1 (Ki = 40.7 nM, located mainly in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor (Ki = 36 nM, mainly expressed in cells of the immune system. The psychoactive effects of THC are primarily mediated by the activation of cannabinoid receptors, which result in a decrease in the concentration of the second messenger molecule cAMP through inhibition of adenylate cyclase. The presence of these specialized cannabinoid receptors in the brain led researchers to the discovery of endocannabinoids, such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoyl glyceride (2-AG).THC is a lipophilic molecule and may bind non-specifically to a variety of entities in the brain and body, such as adipose tissue (fat). THC, as well as other cannabinoids that contain a phenol group, possess mild antioxidant activity sufficient to protect neurons against oxidative stress, such as that produced by glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.THC targets receptors in a manner far less selective than endocannabinoid molecules released during retrograde signaling, as the drug has a relatively low cannabinoid receptor affinity. THC is also limited in its efficacy compared to other cannabinoids due to its partial agonistic activity, as THC appears to result in greater downregulation of cannabinoid receptors than endocannabinoids. Furthermore, in populations of low cannabinoid receptor density, THC may even act to antagonize endogenous agonists that possess greater receptor efficacy. However while THC's pharmacodynamic tolerance may limit the maximal effects of certain drugs, evidence suggests that this tolerance mitigates undesirable effects, thus enhancing the drug's therapeutic window.\n\n\n=== Pharmacokinetics ===\nTHC is metabolized mainly to 11-OH-THC by the body. This metabolite is still psychoactive and is further oxidized to 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH). In animals, more than 100 metabolites could be identified, but 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH are the dominating metabolites. Metabolism occurs mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. More than 55% of THC is excreted in the feces and \u224820% in the urine. The main metabolite in urine is the ester of glucuronic acid and 11-OH-THC and free THC-COOH. In the feces, mainly 11-OH-THC was detected.\n\n\n== Physical and chemical properties ==\n\n\n=== Discovery and structure identification ===\nCannabidiol was isolated and identified from Cannabis sativa in 1940, and THC was isolated and its structure elucidated by synthesis in 1964.\n\n\n=== Solubility ===\nAs with many aromatic terpenoids, THC has a very low solubility in water, but good solubility in lipids and most organic solvents, specifically hydrocarbons and alcohols.\n\n\n=== Total synthesis ===\nA total synthesis of the compound was reported in 1965; that procedure called for the intramolecular alkyl lithium attack on a starting carbonyl to form the fused rings, and a tosyl chloride mediated formation of the ether.\n\n\n=== Biosynthesis ===\nIn the Cannabis plant, THC occurs mainly as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, 2-COOH-THC). Geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid react, catalysed by an enzyme to produce cannabigerolic acid, which is cyclized by the enzyme THC acid synthase to give THCA. Over time, or when heated, THCA is decarboxylated, producing THC. The pathway for THCA biosynthesis is similar to that which produces the bitter acid humulone in hops. It can also be produced in genetically modified yeast.\n\n\n=== No known lethal dose ===\nThe median lethal dose of THC in humans is not known. A 1972 study gave up to 9000 mg/kg of THC to dogs and monkeys without any lethal effects. Some rats died within 72 hours after a dose of up to 3600 mg/kg.\n\n\n=== Detection in body fluids ===\n\nTHC and its 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH metabolites can be detected and quantified in blood, urine, hair, oral fluid or sweat using a combination of immunoassay and chromatographic techniques as part of a drug use testing program or in a forensic investigation.\n\n\n=== Detection in breath ===\nRecreational use of cannabis is legal in many parts of North America, increasing the demand for THC monitoring methods in both personal and law enforcement uses. Breath sampling as a noninvasive method is in development to detect THC, which is difficult to quantify in breath samples. Scientists and industry are commercializing various types of breath analyzers to monitor THC in breath.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nTHC was first isolated and elucidated in 1969 by Raphael Mechoulam and Yechiel Gaoni at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.In 2003, the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drug Dependence recommended transferring THC to Schedule IV of the Convention, citing its medical uses and low abuse and addiction potential. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 allows any hemp derived product not exceeding 0.3% \u0394-9 THC to be sold legally in the US. Since the law counted only \u0394-9 THC, \u0394-8 THC was considered legal to sell under the farm bill and was sold online. In August 2020, all forms of THC were deemed illegal above 0.3% under the Controlled Substances Act according to the DEA. The ruling is currently being debated and companies that formerly sold forms of THC are lobbying to keep other forms of THC other than delta-9 legal for commerce.\n\n\n== Society and culture ==\n\n\n=== Comparisons with medical cannabis ===\n\nFemale cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), thought to be the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis; and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis.\n\n\n=== Regulation in Canada ===\nAs of October 2018 when recreational use of cannabis was legalized in Canada, some 220 dietary supplements and 19 veterinary health products containing not more than 10 parts per million of THC extract were approved with general health claims for treating minor conditions.\n\n\n== Research ==\nThe status of THC as an illegal drug in most countries imposes restrictions on research material supply and funding, such as in the United States where the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Drug Enforcement Administration continue to control the sole federally-legal source of cannabis for researchers.  Despite an August 2016 announcement that licenses would be provided to growers for supplies of medical marijuana, no such licenses were ever issued, despite dozens of applications. Although cannabis is legalized for medical uses in more than half of the states of the United States, no products have been approved for federal commerce by the Food and Drug Administration, a status that limits cultivation, manufacture, distribution, clinical research, and therapeutic applications.In April 2014, the American Academy of Neurology found evidence supporting the effectiveness of the cannabis extracts in treating certain symptoms of multiple sclerosis and pain, but there was insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness for treating several other neurological diseases. A 2015 review confirmed that medical marijuana was effective for treating spasticity and chronic pain, but caused numerous short-lasting adverse events, such as dizziness.\n\n\n=== Multiple sclerosis symptoms ===\nSpasticity. Based on the results of 3 high quality trials and 5 of lower quality, oral cannabis extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective, for improving people's subjective experience of spasticity. Oral cannabis extract and THC both were rated as possibly effective for improving objective measures of spasticity.\nCentrally mediated pain and painful spasms.  Based on the results of 4 high quality trials and 4 low quality trials, oral cannabis extract was rated as effective, and THC as probably effective in treating central pain and painful spasms.\nBladder dysfunction. Based on a single high quality study, oral cannabis extract and THC were rated as probably ineffective for controlling bladder complaints in multiple sclerosis\n\n\n=== Neurodegenerative disorders ===\nHuntington disease. No reliable conclusions could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of THC or oral cannabis extract in treating the symptoms of Huntington disease as the available trials were too small to reliably detect any difference\nParkinson's disease.  Based on a single study, oral CBD extract was rated probably ineffective in treating levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease.\nAlzheimer's disease. A 2009 Cochrane Review found insufficient evidence to conclude whether cannabis products have any utility in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n=== Other neurological disorders ===\nTourette syndrome. The available data was determined to be insufficient to allow reliable conclusions to be drawn regarding the effectiveness of oral cannabis extract or THC in controlling tics.\nCervical dystonia. Insufficient data was available to assess the effectiveness of oral cannabis extract of THC in treating cervical dystonia.\n\n\n=== Potential for toxicity ===\nPreliminary research indicates that exposure to high doses of THC may lead to DNA damage (chromothripsis), which may be hereditary as a factor affecting cell instability and cancer risk.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS)\nCannabinoids\n11-Hydroxy-THC, metabolite of THC\nAnandamide, 2-Arachidonoylglycerol, endogenous cannabinoid agonists\nCannabidiol (CBD)\nCannabinol (CBN), a metabolite of THC\nDelta-8-Tetrahydrocannabinol, a double bond isomer of THC\nDimethylheptylpyran\nDronabinol, the name of THC-based pharmaceutical (INN)\nHU-210, WIN 55,212-2, JWH-133, synthetic cannabinoid agonists (neocannabinoids)\nNabilone, a novel synthetic cannabinoid analog (neocannabinoid)\nParahexyl\nTetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), the biosynthetic precursor for THC\nTetrahydrocannabiphorol, the heptyl homologue\nList of investigational analgesics\nMedical cannabis\nDronabinol\nEpidiolex (prescription form of purified cannabidiol derived from hemp used for treating some rare neurological diseases)\nSativex\nEffects of cannabis\nVaping-associated pulmonary injury\nWar on Drugs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nU.S. National Library of Medicine: Drug Information Portal \u2013 Tetrahydrocannabinol",

    "G\u00fcnter Bernard": "G\u00fcnter Bernard (born 4 November 1939) is a German former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is the son of Robert Bernard who was a German international football player himself.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBernard was born in Schweinfurt, Germany. He joined SV Werder Bremen in the founding year of Bundesliga from boyhood outfit Schweinfurt 05, for whom he had played top-tier matches in the Oberliga S\u00fcd since 1958. He stayed loyal to Bremen until his retirement in 1974 and was the club's first choice in their surprise Bundesliga winning campaign in 1965. He altogether played 287 times on that level for the North Germans.\n\n\n== International career ==\nHis West Germany career started with a youth call-up in 1961 that prompted Sepp Herberger to take him to the senior level a year later. Competing with Wolfgang Fahrian and Hans Tilkowski for the job in goal of West Germany at that time, Bernard made his first West Germany appearance under contract with 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 on 24 October 1962. The Bundesliga trophy he won with Werder Bremen, three years later, helped him to achieve a spot in Helmut Sch\u00f6n's squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but did not give him the competitive edge he had been longing for. So Hans Tilkowski was the West German keeper at the tournament. Bernard made his fifth and final game for West Germany as a substitute for Horst Wolter against Wales in 1968.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nWerder Bremen\n\nBundesliga: 1964\u201365, runner-up 1967\u201368Germany\n\nFIFA World Cup: runner-up 1966\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Heptanone": "2-Heptanone, also known as methyl n-amyl ketone, or Heptan-2-one, is a ketone with the molecular formula C7H14O.  It is a colorless, water-like liquid with a banana-like, fruity odor. 2-Heptanone has a neutral formal charge, and is only slightly soluble in water.\n\n2-Heptanone is listed by the FDA as a \"food additive permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption\" (21 CFR 172.515), and it occurs naturally in certain foods (e.g., beer, white bread, butter, various cheeses and potato chips).The mechanism of action of 2-heptanone as a pheromone at odorant receptors in rodents has been investigated. 2-Heptanone is present in the urine of stressed rats and believe that it is used as a means to alert other rats. Certain species of worms are attracted to 2-heptanone and bacteria can use this as a means of pathogenesis. 2-Heptanone has also been found to be excreted by honey bees when they bite small pests within the colony such as wax moth larvae and Varroa mites. Though it was historically believed to be an alarm pheromone, 2-heptanone has been shown to act as an anaesthetic on the pests, enabling the honey bee to stun the pest and eject it from the hive.  The work could lead to the use of 2-heptanone as an alternative local anaesthetic to lidocaine, which although well established for clinical use, has the disadvantage of provoking allergic reactions in some people.2-Heptanone was one of the metabolites of n-heptane found in the urine of employees exposed to heptane in shoe and tire factories. This commonly occurs from exposure to plasticisers.  2-Heptanone can be absorbed through the skin, inhaled and consumed. Exposure to 2-Heptanone can cause irritation of skin/eyes, respiratory system, headaches, vomiting, and nausea.In mice 2-H is a urinary component and pheromone. It has a high affinity for the main olfactory epithelium. Gaillard et al 2002 found that it agonizes one specific olfactory receptor, and that that OR only binds 2-H.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMSDS for 2-heptanone\nMethyl (n-amyl) ketone, NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards",

    "Communal burrow": "Communal burrow refers to the habitat built by some species of mammals as a community habitat. There are some species that build burrows, but not communal burrows; and there are some species that live in communal groups, but do not construct burrows or any other type of habitat.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nA  burrow is a hole or tunnel excavated into the ground by an animal to create a space suitable for habitation, temporary refuge, or as a byproduct of locomotion.  Burrows provide a form of shelter against predation and exposure to the elements and can be found in nearly every biome and among various biological interactions. Many different animal species are known to form burrows. These species range from small invertebrates, such as the Corophium arenarium, to very large vertebrate species such as the polar bear. Burrows can be constructed into a wide variety of substrates and can range in complexity from a simple tube a few centimeters long to a complex network of interconnecting tunnels and chambers hundreds or thousands of meters in total length. An example of this well-developed burrow would be a rabbit warren.\n\n\n=== Types of burrows ===\n\nAnimals can create burrows using a variety of methods. Burrowing animals can be divided into three categories: primary excavators, secondary modifiers and simple occupants. Primary excavators are the animals that originally dig and construct the burrow, and are generally very strong. Some animals considered to be primary excavators are the prairie dog and the aardvark. Pygmy gerbil are an example of secondary modifiers, as they do not build an original burrow, but will live inside a burrow made by other animals and improve or change some aspects of the burrow for their own purpose. The third category, simple occupants, neither build nor modify the burrow but simply live inside or use it for their own purpose.  Some species of Bird will actually make use of burrows built by tortoises, which is an example of simple occupancy. These animals can also be referred to as commensals.\n\n\n== Specific species ==\n\n\n=== Common degus ===\nCommon degus are highly social. They live in burrows, and, by digging communally, they are able to construct larger and more elaborate burrows than they could on their own. Degus digging together coordinate their activities, forming digging chains. Females living in the same group have been shown to spontaneously nest communally; they nurse one another's young. They spend a large amount of time on the surface, where they forage for food. When foraging, their ability to detect predators is increased in larger groups, and each animal needs to spend less time in vigilance.\nCommon degus exhibit a wide array of communication techniques.  They have an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising up to 15 different sounds, and the young need to be able to hear their mother's calls if the emotional systems in their brains are to develop properly. They use their urine to scent mark, and experiments have shown that they react to one another's marks, although in males the hormone testosterone may suppress their sense of smell somewhat.\n\nCommon degus are seasonal breeders; the breeding season for wild degus begins in the Chilean autumn when day and night are roughly equal, with pups born in early to mid-spring.Common degu pups are born relatively precocial, fully furred and with eyes open, and their auditory and visual systems are functional at birth. Unlike most other rodents, male common degus also take part in protecting and raising their pups until they are old enough to leave the family.\n\n\n=== Plains viscacha ===\nPlains viscacha live in communal burrow systems in groups containing one or more males, several females, and immatures. Viscachas forage in groups at night and aggregate underground during the day. All members of a group use burrows throughout the communal burrow system and participate in digging at the burrows. Alarm calls are given primarily by adult males. The long-term social unit of the plains viscacha is the female group. Resident males disappear each year and new males join groups of females. Viscachas live in colonies that range from a few individuals to hundreds. To keep up with the colony chatter, they have acquired an impressive repertoire of vocalizations that are used in social interactions. Dominance is absent among females. Members of a social group share a common foraging area around the communal burrow system, and feed on a variety of grasses and forbs, occasionally browsing on low shrubs.\nThey collect branches and heavy objects to cover the burrow entrance. When they live close to human settlements, tend to hoard brooms, tables, garden tools, firewood, trinkets, pieces of concrete, and many human-made objects to cover the burrow.\n\n\n=== Daurian pikas ===\nDaurian pikas have been observed sharing burrows with several other mammal species. They occasionally \u201cvisit\u201d burrows of Altai marmots and Mongolian pikas. In turn, their burrows are visited by ground squirrels, and sometimes by burrowing birds. Due to low competition and predation rates, the limiting factor on Daurian pika populations is winter.\n\n\n=== Prairie dogs ===\n\nHighly social, prairie dogs live in large colonies or \"towns\" and collections of prairie dog families that can span hundreds of acres. The prairie dog family groups are the most basic units of its society. Members of a family group inhabit the same territory.   Family groups of black-tailed and Mexican prairie dogs are called \"coteries\", while \"clans\" are used to describe family groups of white-tailed, Gunnison\u2019s, and Utah prairie dogs.Although these two family groups are similar, coteries tend to be more closely knit than clans. Members of a family group interact through oral contact or \"kissing\" and grooming one another.   They do not perform these behaviors with prairie dogs from other family groups.   \n\nA prairie dog town may contain 15\u201326 family groups. There may also be subgroups within a town, called \"wards\", which are separated by a physical barrier. Family groups exist within these wards. Most prairie dog family groups are made up of one adult breeding male, two to three adult females and one to two male offspring and one to two female offspring. Females remain in their natal groups for life and are thus the source of stability in the groups. Males leave their natal groups when they mature to find another family group to defend and breed in. Some family groups contain more breeding females than one male can control, so have more than one breeding adult male in them. Among these multiple-male groups, some may contain males that have friendly relationships, but the majority contain males that have largely antagonistic relationships. In the former, the males tend to be related, while in the latter, they tend not to be related. Two to three groups of females may be controlled by one male. However, among these female groups, there are no friendly relations.\nThe average prairie dog territory takes up 0.05\u20131.01 hectares (0.12\u20132.50 acres). Territories have well-established borders that coincide with physical barriers such as rocks and trees. The resident male of a territory defends it and antagonistic behavior will occur between two males of different families to defend their territories. These interactions may happen 20 times per day and last five minutes. When two prairie dogs encounter each other at the edges of their territories, they will start staring, make bluff charges, flare their tails, chatter their teeth, and sniff each other's perianal scent glands. When fighting, prairie dogs will bite, kick and ram each other.  If their competitor is around their size or smaller, the females will participate in fighting. Otherwise, if a competitor is sighted, the females signal for the resident male.\n\n\n=== Pygmy rabbits ===\nPygmy rabbits are normally found in areas on deep soils with tall, dense sagebrush which they use for shelter and food. Individual sagebrush plants in areas inhabited by pygmy rabbits are often 6 feet (1.8 m) or more in height.  Extensive, well-used runways interlace the sage thickets and provide travel and escape routes. Dense stands of big sagebrush along streams, roads, and fencerows provide dispersal corridors for pygmy rabbits.The pygmy rabbit is the only leporid native to North America that digs burrows.    Juveniles use burrows more than other age groups. Early reproductive activities of adults may be concentrated at burrows. When pygmy rabbits can utilize sagebrush cover, burrow use is decreased. Pygmy rabbits use burrows more in the winter for thermal cover than at other times of the year.Burrows are usually located on slopes at the base of sagebrush plants, and face north to east. Tunnels widen below the surface, forming chambers, and extend to a maximum depth of about 1 meter (3.3 ft). Burrows typically have 4 or 5 entrances but may have as few as 2 or as many as 10. In Oregon, pygmy rabbits inhabited areas where soils were significantly deeper and looser than soils at adjacent sites. Site selection was probably related to ease of excavation of burrows. In areas where soil is shallow pygmy rabbits live in holes among volcanic rocks, in stone walls, around abandoned buildings, and in burrows made by badgers (Taxidea taxus) and marmots (Marmota flaviventris).Some researchers have found that pygmy rabbits never venture farther than 60 feet (18 m) from their burrows. However, Bradfield observed pygmy rabbits range up to 100 meters (330 ft) from their burrows.\nSome areas inhabited by pygmy rabbits are covered with several feet of snow for up to 2 or more months during the winter. During periods when the snow has covered most of the sagebrush, pygmy rabbits tunnel beneath the snow to find food. Snow tunnels are approximately the same height and width as burrows. They are quite extensive and extend from one sagebrush to another. Above ground movement during the winter months is restricted to these tunnel systems.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHabitat\nCommunity\nSocial animals\n\n\n== References ==",

Jake, disguised as a milkman, and Finn, disguised as his shadow, successfully enter the building. Finn sneaks off to take care of Baby-Snaps's chocolate chip accomplices, while Jake tries to reason with the cookie.\nJake soon learns that Baby-Snaps grew up in an orphanage, and that his life changed when he first met Princess Bubblegum, due to the happiness she brought to the children. However, after a young Baby-Snaps told her that he too wanted to be a princess, she laughed at him. This in turn, caused him to resent her. Jake, sympathetic to Baby-Snaps's plight, helps him escape, although the two are pursued by the Banana Guards. Cornered on the precipice of a canyon, Baby-Snaps realizes the futility of his flight, thanks Jake, and jumps over the edge.\nHowever, instead of dying, he is merely fragmented into several pieces. Baby-Snaps is later put back together and institutionalized. At the hospital, Finn and Jake arrive and, with the approval of Princess Bubblegum, Jake gives Baby-Snaps a grass crown so that he can be the princess of the Grasslands.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\"Princess Cookie\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Skyler Page, from a story developed by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. Donald Faison guest stars in this episode, playing the part of Baby-Snaps. Faison later noted in an interview that his experience with Adventure Time was extremely positive; DiMaggio came and read lines with him, which Faison called \"really cool because usually when you do voiceover work it's just you in a box and a director and a writer and whoever else is in another room.\" He also revealed that he has received a large amount of positive feedback for his role, and that he would love to reprise his character if given the chance. Likewise, the writing and production staff of Adventure Time were pleased with both Faison's performance and his amiability, with Herpich noting he was \"so, so nice.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\"Princess Cookie\" aired on Cartoon Network on June 25, 2012. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete fourth season DVD in October 2014.Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \"A\", calling it \"one of the strongest episodes of this season\". He was complimentary towards the story, writing that it \"starts mid-adventure and never loses momentum.\" Sava praised the casting of Faison, writing that he \"is absolutely fantastic in this episode, delivering his absurd lines with a passion that helps sell the drama of the scenario.\" Sava also felt that the final scene was both optimistic and beautiful, and he concluded that the \"contrast between a bleak situation and literally candy-covered everything else is what Adventure Time is founded on, and 'Princess Cookies' [sic] embodies that idea masterfully.\"The episode was later nominated for \"Best Animated Television Production For Children\" at the 2013 Annie Awards, although the episode did not win. It was also screened at the 2013 Annecy International Animated Film Festival.\n\n\n== Explanatory notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Princess Cookie\" at IMDb",

    "German submarine U-671": "German submarine U-671 was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. The submarine was laid down on 5 December 1941 at the Howaldtswerke yard at Hamburg, launched on 15 December 1942, and commissioned on 3 March 1943 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See August-Wilhelm hewicker.\nAttached to 5th U-boat Flotilla based at Kiel, U-671 completed her training period on 30 April 1944 and was assigned to front-line service.\n\n\n== Design ==\nGerman Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. U-671 had a displacement of 769 tonnes (757 long tons) when at the surface and 871 tonnes (857 long tons) while submerged. She had a total length of 67.10 m (220 ft 2 in), a pressure hull length of 50.50 m (165 ft 8 in), a beam of 6.20 m (20 ft 4 in), a height of 9.60 m (31 ft 6 in), and a draught of 4.74 m (15 ft 7 in). The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2,800 to 3,200 metric horsepower (2,060 to 2,350 kW; 2,760 to 3,160 shp) for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38\u20138 double-acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower (550 kW; 740 shp) for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two 1.23 m (4 ft) propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres (750 ft).The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17.7 knots (32.8 km/h; 20.4 mph) and a maximum submerged speed of 7.6 knots (14.1 km/h; 8.7 mph). When submerged, the boat could operate for 80 nautical miles (150 km; 92 mi) at 4 knots (7.4 km/h; 4.6 mph); when surfaced, she could travel 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km; 9,800 mi) at 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph). U-671 was fitted with five 53.3 cm (21 in) torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one 8.8 cm (3.46 in) SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin 2 cm (0.79 in) C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.\n\n\n== Service history ==\nOn the second and last war patrol, U-671 was detected by two British warships in the English Channel south of Brighton in the early hours of 4 August 1944. HMS Stayner attacked with depth charges and hedgehogs causing severe damage to the U-boat. Stayner was later joined by HMS Wensleydale. Repeated attacks resulted in an oil spill and a number of survivors appeared at the surface. Of the crew of 52 all but five perished in the attack.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHelgason, Gu\u00f0mundur. \"The Type VIIC boat U-671\".

    "Heawood conjecture": "In graph theory, the Heawood conjecture or Ringel\u2013Youngs theorem gives a lower bound for the number of colors that are necessary for graph coloring on a surface of a given genus. For surfaces of genus 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., the required number of colors is 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 12, .... OEIS: A000934, the chromatic number or Heawood number.\nThe conjecture was formulated in 1890 by Percy John Heawood and proven in 1968 by Gerhard Ringel and Ted Youngs. One case, the non-orientable Klein bottle, proved an exception to the general formula. An entirely different approach was needed for the much older problem of finding the number of colors needed for the plane or sphere, solved in 1976 as the four color theorem by Haken and Appel. On the sphere the lower bound is easy, whereas for higher genera the upper bound is easy and was proved in Heawood's original short paper that contained the conjecture. In other words, Ringel, Youngs and others had to construct extreme examples for every genus g = 1,2,3,.... If g = 12s + k, the genera fall into 12 cases according as k = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. To simplify, suppose that case k has been established if only a finite number of g's of the form 12s + k are in doubt. Then the years in which the twelve cases were settled and by whom are the following:\n\n1954, Ringel: case 5\n1961, Ringel: cases 3,7,10\n1963, Terry, Welch, Youngs: cases 0,4\n1964, Gustin, Youngs: case 1\n1965, Gustin: case 9\n1966, Youngs: case 6\n1967, Ringel, Youngs: cases 2,8,11The last seven sporadic exceptions were settled as follows:\n\n1967, Mayer: cases 18, 20, 23\n1968, Ringel, Youngs: cases 30, 35, 47, 59, and the conjecture was proved.\n\n\n== Formal statement ==\n\nPercy John Heawood conjectured in 1890 that for a given genus g > 0, the minimum number of colors necessary to color all graphs drawn on an orientable surface of that genus (or equivalently to color the regions of any partition of the surface into simply connected regions) is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        (\n        g\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \u230a\n          \n            \n              \n                7\n                +\n                \n                  \n                    1\n                    +\n                    48\n                    g\n                  \n                \n              \n              2\n            \n          \n          \u230b\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma (g)=\\left\\lfloor {\\frac {7+{\\sqrt {1+48g}}}{2}}\\right\\rfloor ,}\n  where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u230a\n          x\n          \u230b\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left\\lfloor x\\right\\rfloor }\n   is the floor function.\nReplacing the genus by the Euler characteristic, we obtain a formula that covers both the orientable and non-orientable cases,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n        (\n        \u03c7\n        )\n        =\n        \n          \u230a\n          \n            \n              \n                7\n                +\n                \n                  \n                    49\n                    \u2212\n                    24\n                    \u03c7\n                  \n                \n              \n              2\n            \n          \n          \u230b\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma (\\chi )=\\left\\lfloor {\\frac {7+{\\sqrt {49-24\\chi }}}{2}}\\right\\rfloor .}\n  This relation holds, as Ringel and Youngs showed, for all surfaces except for the Klein bottle. Philip Franklin (1930) proved that the Klein bottle requires at most 6 colors, rather than 7 as predicted by the formula. The Franklin graph can be drawn on the Klein bottle in a way that forms six mutually-adjacent regions, showing that this bound is tight.\nThe upper bound, proved in Heawood's original short paper, is based on a greedy coloring algorithm. By manipulating the Euler characteristic, one can show that every graph embedded in the given surface must have at least one vertex of degree less than the given bound. If one removes this vertex, and colors the rest of the graph, the small number of edges incident to the removed vertex ensures that it can be added back to the graph and colored without increasing the needed number of colors beyond the bound. In the other direction, the proof is more difficult, and involves showing that in each case (except the Klein bottle) a complete graph with a number of vertices equal to the given number of colors can be embedded on the surface.\n\n\n== Example ==\n\nThe torus has g = 1, so \u03c7 = 0. Therefore, as the formula states, any subdivision of the torus into regions can be colored using at most seven colors. The illustration shows a subdivision of the torus in which each of seven regions are adjacent to each other region; this subdivision shows that the bound of seven on the number of colors is tight for this case. The boundary of this subdivision forms an embedding of the Heawood graph onto the torus.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nFranklin, P. (1934). \"A six color problem\".

    "71 Harrington Street, The Rocks": "71 Harrington Street, The Rocks are heritage-listed serviced apartments and former terrace houses and shops located at 71 Harrington Street, in the inner city Sydney suburb of The Rocks in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1860. It is also known as Sailors Return Hotel; Stafford Apts. and 75 Harrington Street; Clocktower Development. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe site, in 1807, was located to the west of the garden of the Colony's hospital. After the formation of Harrington Street a portion comprising 13 perches on the western side of the street was granted to a Claimant Thomas Weedon in November 1840. The site was allotment 8 in Section 79 as show on an 1835 survey. Weedon continued as landlord until a date between 1867 and 1871, when Frederick Oatley purchased the property. The 1835 survey map shows an L-shaped building located in the northern half of the site together with a substantial structure to the south. In 1845 the City Council assessed the northern section of the site as containing a two-room stone house with shingled roof. The two room stone house appears in the Rate Assessment books, described as a \"very old building\", until 1882, when no entry is recorded at this address. The 1891 rate assessment notes Oatley and Cahill as the owners of the site. Oatley remained the owner until c.\u20091895, when E. B. McKenny became proprietor. The site appears to have remained vacant until c.\u20091896, when a building, rated as a two-storey house, was constructed for E. B. McKenny.The house first appeared in the 1898 Sands Directory, when it was known as 33 Harrington Street. It was rated as a shop, and was occupied by a George Jones. The numbering changed to 71 Harrington Street in 1924.In December 1900 Harrington Street was resumed by the NSW Government as part of Section 8 Observatory Hill lands, component of section 79 City of Sydney. Entries in various Sands Directories indicate that George Jones operated a lodging house at 33 Harrington Street between 1903 and 1918. In 1919 and 1920 Mrs Mary Jones managed the establishment. In the 1920s and 30s there was a large turnover of tenants in the building, tenants paying \u00a31/7/6 per week in the 1920s and \u00a31/9/6 per week in the 1930s. SCA tenancy records provide evidence of the everyday existential problems of tenants, noting endless rental arrears and requests for rental reduction or transfer to cheaper premises. In February 1937 George Henry Johnson signed the tenancy contract for the premises. Johnson and his family remained tenant at 71 Harrington Street until 1973, paying \u00a31/5/0 per week in 1937, \u00a32/16/0 in 1957 and $20 in 1973. Sydney Cove Authority records note rental arrears and indebtedness of G. H. Johnson a number of times during the 36 years of his tenancy.Tenancy records note a number of smaller repair and improvement and the tenant's request \"to have the hall and kitchen renovated\" and \"to have gas store connected\" (1944). In 1946 Johnson asked the \"Board to build verandah or porch\" and applied \"for a new entrance be made from the residence to Harrington Street\". The tenant's request for renovation and repairs indicate that in the 1960s the building was in a run-down condition. The building was vacant for at least ten years then in the late-1980s it was redeveloped as part of the Clock Tower development.During the redevelopment of the block in the 1980s the rear section of the house at 71 Harrington Street was demolished. The 1986 plan below indicates that half of the rear portion and the chimney stack were removed and a single brick wall built at the western end of the house. Some of the existing internal walls were removed, two doorways were bricked up and new doors and a window were fitted into existing walls at both levels. The architectural character of the street fa\u00e7ade and the general roof form together with the noteworthy chimney were retained, but the original house lost its size, mass and form, with much of its original fabric modified. The refurbishment involved the re-roofing of the buildings, replacement of floors and replacement of original features such as fireplaces, doors and windows with sympathetic replicated elements. While the house was modified, it generally still presents as intact when viewed from Harrington Street.\n\n\n== Description ==\n71 Harrington Street was constructed c.\u20091895. Originally rated as a \"shop\" it later became a \"lodging house\" and, finally, a house. As far it is known the original roof was of corrugated iron.\nStoreys: Two; Facade: Brick and render; Roof Cladding: Iron.\n\n\n=== Condition ===\nAs at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Area under building only. Terraced into hill slope.\n\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n1986/87: The facade of the building was restored as part of the Clocktower development. The iron on the roof was replaced.\n\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 30 March 2011, this house and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right.The site has historical significance as part of the Colony's hospital site in 1807, and the building as part of the 19th century housing stock in The Rocks.

In the late-1980s the rear section of the house was demolished and the retained portion became incorporated into the serviced apartment building of the Clock Tower development. The building lost its identity and ability to demonstrate its original configuration and use. The retained street section, however, enhances the human scale of the streetscape. Together with the adjacent terraces it forms a strong visual precinct, contributing to the characteristic Rocks townscape.House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\nOriginally built in the 1890s, the house at 71 Harrington Street provided accommodation of the lower middle and working classes in residence in The Rocks until the mid-1970s The remaining portion of the house at 71 Harrington Street has historic significance as part of the 19th century housing stock in The Rocks.

    "Worcester Village School": "The Worcester Village School is a historic school building at 17 Calais Road in Worcester, Vermont.  It was built in 1892, and is a good early example of a town-wide partially graded school with restrained Queen Anne features.  It served as a school until 1979, and is now owned by the local historical society.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.\n\n\n== Description and history ==\nThe former Worcester Village School building stands on the south side of Calais Road, a short way east of the crossroads center of Worcester's main village.  It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame building, with a front-facing gable roof and exterior finished mainly in wooden clapboards.  The front facade is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances sheltered by a hip-roofed single-story porch supported by chamfered square posts.  Bands of fishscale shingles separate the first and second floors, with paired sash windows on the second floor.  The eastern side of the building has bands of sash windows toward the rear, providing significant natural light to the classroom spaces.  The interior is virtually intact, with front vestibules leading to large classroom spaces which occupy most of each floor.  The only major alteration is that portions of the vestibule have been turned into restrooms.The school was built in 1892, and is a rare example of a two-room 19th-century school house.  It is also noted for the quality of the surviving exterior Queen Anne elements.  The school was built after the state abolished the district school system, and served grades 1-4 on the ground floor and 5-8 on the upper floor.  The district school it replaced was moved across the street and converted into a residence.  This building was used as a school until 1979, and served from 1980 to 2004 as a day care center.  It is now owned by the local historical society.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Vermont\n\n\n== References ==",

The series aired on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and the Tokyo Broadcasting System from October 4, 1987 to October 9, 1988. \nThe series has spawned a manga adaptation that ran in Sh\u014dnen Sunday during its broadcast; a direct sequel, Kamen Rider Black RX, in 1988; and an upcoming reboot film titled Kamen Rider Black Sun (\u4eee\u9762\u30e9\u30a4\u30c0\u30fcBLACK SUN, Kamen Raid\u0101 Burakku San) to premiere in 2022.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nAfter being kidnapped by the cult Gorgom on the night of their 19th birthday, stepbrothers Kohtaro Minami and Nobuhiko Akizuki were submitted to a cyborg surgery with the purpose of becoming the candidates for the next Gorgom Creation King. Both of them are called Century Kings and are destined to best each other in a final battle - whoever wins will become the next Creation King. Kotaro escaped before getting brainwashed (which is the final step in the surgery), with help from his foster father and turned against Gorgom. He soon finds out the horrific truth from his stepfather: Gorgom originally killed his true parents and, since both Kohtaro and Nobuhiko were born on the day of a solar eclipse, are referred to as \"Black Sun\" and \"Shadow Moon\". Kotaro, taking on the name of Kamen Rider Black, was determined to rescue his stepbrother from Gorgom while protecting Japan. However, later in the series, Nobuhiko emerged as Shadow Moon to fight Kohtaro with the survivor becoming the next Creation King.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\nBlack!!

    "Edwin Morgan": "Edwin George Morgan  (27 April 1920 \u2013 17 August 2010) was a Scottish poet and translator associated with the Scottish Renaissance. He is widely recognised as one of the foremost Scottish poets of the 20th century. In 1999, Morgan was made the first Glasgow Poet Laureate. In 2004, he was named as the first Makar or National Poet for Scotland.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nMorgan was born in Glasgow and grew up in Rutherglen. His parents were Presbyterian. As a child he was not surrounded by books, nor did he have any literary acquaintances. Schoolmates labelled him a swot. He convinced his parents to finance his membership of several book clubs in Glasgow. The Faber Book of Modern Verse (1936) was a \"revelation\" to him, he later said.Morgan entered the University of Glasgow in 1937. It was at university that he studied French and Russian, while self-educating in \"a good bit of Italian and German\" as well. After interrupting his studies to serve in World War II as a non-combatant conscientious objector with the Royal Army Medical Corps, Morgan graduated in 1947 and became a lecturer at the University. He worked there until his retirement as a full professor in 1980.Morgan described 'CHANGE RULES!' as 'the supreme graffito', whose liberating double-take suggests both a lifelong commitment to formal experimentation and his radically democratic left-wing political perspectives. From traditional sonnet to blank verse, from epic seriousness to camp and ludic nonsense; and whether engaged in time-travelling space fantasies or exploring contemporary developments in physics and technology, the range of Morgan's voices is a defining attribute.Morgan first outlined his sexuality in Nothing Not Giving Messages: Reflections on his Work and Life (1990). He had written many famous love poems, among them \"Strawberries\" and \"The Unspoken\", in which the love object was not gendered; this was partly because of legal problems at the time but also out of a desire to universalise them, as he made clear in an interview with Marshall Walker. At the opening of the Glasgow LGBT Centre in 1995, he read a poem he had written for the occasion, and presented it to the centre as a gift.In 2002, he became the patron of Our Story Scotland. At the opening of the Scottish Parliament building in Edinburgh on 9 October 2004, Liz Lochhead read a poem written for the occasion by Morgan, titled \"Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament\".  She was announced as Morgan's successor as Scots Makar in January 2011.Near the end of his life, Morgan reached a new audience after collaborating with the Scottish band Idlewild on their album The Remote Part. In the closing moments of the album's final track \"In Remote Part/ Scottish Fiction\", he recites a poem, \"Scottish Fiction\", written specifically for the song.In 2007, Morgan contributed two poems to the compilation Ballads of the Book, for which a range of Scottish writers created poems to be made into songs by Scottish musicians. Morgan's songs \"The Good Years\" and \"The Weight of Years\" were performed by Karine Polwart and Idlewild respectively.Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney \"[paid] formal homage\" during a 2005 visit.In later life Morgan was cared for at a residential home as his health worsened. He published a collection in April 2010, months before his death, titled Dreams and Other Nightmares to mark his 90th birthday. Up until his death, he was the last survivor of the canonical 'Big Seven' (the others being Hugh MacDiarmid, Robert Garioch, Norman MacCaig, Iain Crichton Smith, George Mackay Brown, and Sorley MacLean).\n\nOn 17 August 2010, Edwin Morgan died of pneumonia in Glasgow at the age of 90. The Scottish Poetry Library made the announcement in the morning. Tributes came from, among others, politicians Alex Salmond and Iain Gray, as well as Carol Ann Duffy, the UK Poet Laureate. The next day it was announced that all of the bequest would be used for the party's independence referendum campaign. Morgan also left \u00a345,000 to a number of friends, former colleagues and charity organisations and set aside another \u00a31 million for the creation of the Edwin Morgan Poetry Award, an annual award scheme for young poets in Scotland. In 2012, The Edwin Morgan Trust was established to administer the generous Award which the poet wished to create from the earnings of a long and distinguished writing career. From 27 April 2020 The Edwin Morgan Trust will be celebrating the life and work of Edwin Morgan with a year long centenary programme.\n\n\n== Poetry ==\n\nMorgan worked in a wide range of forms and styles, from the sonnet to concrete poetry. His Collected Poems appeared in 1990. He has also translated from a wide range of languages, including Russian, Hungarian, French, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Old English (Beowulf). Many of these are collected in Rites of Passage. Selected Translations (1976). His 1952 translation of Beowulf has become a standard translation in America.Morgan was also influenced by the American beat poets, with their simple, accessible ideas and language being prominent features in his work.\nHis poetry may be studied as a Scottish Text for National 5 English. Currently, if Edwin Morgan is studied at National 5, pupils study:  \"Winter\" - a depressed narrator describing Bingham's pond during winter; \"In the Snackbar\"; \"Glasgow 5 March 1971\"; \"Good Friday\" - a poem about a bus journey on the christian holiday; \"Trio\" - a tale about the power of friendship; Glasgow Sonnet (I) - a petrarchan sonnet about poverty.\nIn 1968 Morgan wrote \"Starlings in George Square\". This poem could be read as a comment on society's reluctance to accept the integration of different races. Other people have also considered it to be about the Russian Revolution in which \"Starling\" could be a reference to \"Stalin\".\nOther notable poems include:\n\n\"The Death of Marilyn Monroe\" (1962) \u2013 an outpouring of emotion and a social criticism after the death of prominent actress, Marilyn Monroe\n\"King Billy\" (1968) \u2013 flashback of the gang warfare in Glasgow led by Billy Fullerton in the 1930s.\n\"Glasgow 5 March 1971\" \u2013 robbery by two youths by pushing an unsuspecting couple through a shop window on Sauchiehall Street\n\"In the Snackbar\" \u2013 concise description of an encounter with a disabled pensioner in a Glasgow caf\u00e9.\n\"A Good Year for Death\" (26 September 1977) \u2013 a description of five famous people from the world of popular culture who died in 1977\n\"Poem for the Opening of the Scottish Parliament\" \u2013 which was read by Liz Lochhead at the opening ceremony because he was too ill to read it in person.

    "Maud Barger-Wallach": "Maud Barger-Wallach (June 15, 1870 \u2013 April 2, 1954) was an American tennis player of the early 1900s.\nShe was the daughter of Samuel F. Barger, a lawyer and director of the New York Central Railroad, and Edna Jenie LaFavor. In June 1890 she married sportsman Richard Wallach.She only began playing tennis when she was about 30 years old. In 1908, Barger-Wallach became the oldest U.S. Open champion at the age of 38 (42-year-old Molla Mallory won in 1926, taking away her old-age record).At the age of 61 in 1931, she traveled overseas with the U.S. men's tennis contingent, and when Sidney Wood of the U.S. won the Wimbledon Gentlemen's Singles over Frank Shields of the U.S. in the final, in a walkover because Shields was injured, Wood gave his trophy to Barger-Wallach to hold until the next time that he and Shields should play each other on grass (as at Wimbledon), telling her to give it to the winner. Wood finally met Shields in a tournament on grass at Queen's Club in London three years later, beating him, and Barger-Wallach then gave Wood's Wimbledon trophy to him.She was a right-handed baseline player with an accurate but soft forehand and a weak backhand which, if possible, she tried to run around. She had an unorthodox playing style characterized by an underhand serve, accurate placements as well as tennis intelligence and determination.Barger-Wallach was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1958.\n\n\n== Grand Slam finals ==\n\n\n=== Singles: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up) ===\n\n\n=== Doubles: 1 runner-up ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMaud Barger-Wallach at the International Tennis Hall of Fame\nSportspundit.com profile",

The word adempiere in Italian means \"to fulfill\" or \"to accomplish\".The software is licensed under the GNU General Public License.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe ADempiere project was created in September 2006.  Disagreement between the open-source developer community that formed around the Compiere open-source ERP  software and the project's corporate sponsor ultimately led to the creation of Adempiere as a fork of Compiere.\nWithin weeks of the fork, ADempiere reached the top five of the SourceForge.net rankings. This ranking provides a measure of both the size of its developer community and also its impact on the open source ERP software market.\nThe project name comes from an Italian word which means \"satisfy\" but with the additional senses of \"Complete, reach, practice, perform  tasks, or release; also, give honor, respect\", here which were considered appropriate to what the project aimed to achieve.\n\n\n== Goals of this project ==\nThe goal of the Adempiere project is the creation of a community-developed and supported open source business solution. The Adempiere community follows the open-source model of the Bazaar described in Eric Raymond's article The Cathedral and the Bazaar.\n\n\n== Business functionality ==\nThe following business areas are addressed by the Adempiere application:\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP)\nSupply Chain Management (SCM)\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM)\nFinancial Performance Analysis\nIntegrated Point of sale (POS) solution\nCost Engine for different Cost types\nTwo different Productions (light and complex) which include Order batch and Material Requirements Planning (or Manufacturing Resource Planning).\n\n\n== Project structure ==\nAll community members are entitled to their say in the project discussion forums. For practical purposes, the project is governed by a council of contributors. A leader is nominated from this council to act as overall project manager.

Currently database support is restricted to PostgreSQL and Oracle.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nAdempiere inherited the Data Dictionary from the Compiere project.  This architecture extends the Data Dictionary concept into the application; thus the application's entities, their validation rules and screen layout can be controlled from within the application itself. In practice, this means that customization of the application can be done without new coding.\nA Workflow Management Coalition and Object Management Group standards based workflow engine is utilized to provide Business Process Management.  These features allow for the rapid customization of the application to a business's needs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCompiere, iDempiere, metasfresh, Openbravo (Compiere source code family)\nList of ERP software packages\nList of ERP vendors\nList of free and open source software packages\n\n\n=== forks ===\niDempiere It modularized the code through the OSGi framework so it allows a plugin architecture.\nmetasfresh - originally based on ADempiere, developed in Germany.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nNotes\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Community website",

She is the daughter of Jaime Mariscal de Ghent, a judge of the Public Order Tribunal created in Francoist Spain. The brother of this judge, Commissioner Mariscal de Gante, is also known for having invited the torturer Billy el Ni\u00f1o, the alias of Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez Pacheco, to celebrate in a police station in Madrid.

    "Standard operating procedure": "A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of step-by-step instructions compiled by an organization to help workers carry out routine operations. SOPs aim to achieve efficiency, quality output and uniformity of performance, while reducing miscommunication and failure to comply with industry regulations.\nThe military (e.g. in the U.S. and UK) sometimes uses the term standing (rather than standard) operating procedure because a military SOP refers to a unit's unique procedures, which are not necessarily standard to another unit. The word \"standard\" can imply that only one (standard) procedure is to be used across all units.\nThe term can also be used facetiously to refer to practices that are unconstructive, yet the norm. In the Philippines, for instance, \"SOP\" is the term for pervasive corruption within the government and its institutions.\n\n\n== Clinical research and practice ==\nIn clinical research, the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) defines SOPs as \"detailed, written instructions to achieve uniformity of the performance of a specific function\". SOPs usually get applied in pharmaceutical processing and for related clinical studies. There the focus is always set on repeated application of unchanged processes and procedures and its documentation, hence supporting the segregation of origins, causes and effects. Further application is with triage, when limited resources get used according to an assessment on ranking, urgence and staffing possibilities.  Study director is mainly responsible for SOPs. The Quality Assurance Unit are individuals who are responsible for monitoring whether the study report and tests are meeting the SOP. \nSOPs can also provide employees with a reference to common business practices, activities, or tasks. New employees use a SOP to answer questions without having to interrupt supervisors to ask how an operation is performed. The international quality standard ISO 9001 essentially requires the determination of processes (documented as standard operating procedures) used in any manufacturing process that could affect the quality of the product.\n\n\n== Health safety and environment ==\nProcedures are extensively employed to assist with working safely. They are sometimes called safe work methods statements (SWMS, pronounced as 'Swims'). They are usually preceded by various methods of analysing tasks or jobs to be performed in a workplace, including an approach called job safety analysis, in which hazards are identified and their control methods described. Procedures must be suited to the literacy levels of the user, and as part of this, the readability of procedures is important.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProcedure\nWork method statement\nSafe work procedure\nChecklist \u2013 Aide-memoire to ensure consistency and completeness in carrying out a task\nRunbook \u2013 Record of procedures for IT system staff\nCode of conduct \u2013 set of rules outlining the responsibilities of, or proper practices for, an individual, party or organization\nGxP\nProtocol\nOperations research \u2013 Discipline concerning the application of advanced analytical methods\nQuality control \u2013 Project management process making sure produced products are good\nRules of engagement \u2013 Internal limits, authorizations and directives on use of force in combat\nBureaucracy \u2013 Administrative system governing any large institution\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nICH Guidance E6: Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated guideline\nEuropean Medicines Agency Guideline for Good Clinical Practice",

    "P. Srinivas": "Pandillapalli Srinivas was an Indian Forest Service officer (Deputy Conservator of Forests, Karnataka), who is widely considered to be one of the most outstanding figures in Indian forest conservation.He was a highly successful visionary who helped the villagers of Karnataka, by paving roads and connecting settlements. He provided drinking water channels to tribal regions, and initiated a mobile dispensary unit to assist the poor with medical services. He constructed more than 40 homes for the homeless with his own salary, started afforestation drives, and spread awareness about wildlife and the environment among the villagers.  He also rehabilitated and reformed around 120 rebels. He was murdered in November 1991 by the forest brigand Veerappan.In 1992, the President of India conferred the Kirti Chakra to the slain officer's mother as a testament to her son's bravery, noble deeds and commitment in serving the nation. Today, Srinivas is remembered as an honest, dedicated and highly competent Indian civil servant who uplifted the lives of the poor, and he is revered as a deity in several villages in Karnataka.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nPandillapalli Srinivas was born in Rajahmundry, East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, on 12 September 1954; the first son of Ananta Rao and Jayalaxmi, Srinivas spent most of his childhood in his grandmother's  village of Kamarajupeta in Rajahmundry. He completed his primary education in Nagaraju Junior Basis School and Higher Secondary from Lantern High School Rajahmundry. He graduated from Government Arts College in Rajamundry and in 1976 completed his Masters in Life Sciences from Andhra University and secured a gold medal.\n\n\n== Service ==\nIn 1979, he qualified for the Indian Forest Service and was assigned to Karnataka Cadre. His first posting (in 1982) was as Assistant Conservator of Forests (ACF) in Chamarajanagar of Mysore district, which was already affected by the activity of Veerappan, who was then a small-time poacher. Srinivas was elevated to the post of Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF) Chamarajanagar in 1983 and stayed there till 1987.As ACF, he compiled a directory of all sandalwood smugglers and poachers operating in the area and procured and circulated their photographs. He established and coordinated networks between the police and foresters, drew up strategies to curb the activities of smugglers and poachers and successfully isolated and cornered a large number of them. When the Centre banned the sale of ivory and ivory products, and made the possession of ivory articles, beyond a limit a recognisable offence, the bandit Veerappan switched to sandalwood smuggling.\n\n\n== Encounter with Veerappan ==\nSrinivas was the first and only person to arrest Veerappan in 1986 while the SAARC Summit was in progress at Bengaluru. Veerappan was brought to Budipadaga Forest Rest House in Chamarajanagar Division for interrogation. Based on the information gathered, Srinivas conducted numerous raids on the gang's hideouts in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. \nWhen Srinivas was out on one of these raids, Veerappan escaped from custody. An enquiry was ordered into this escape and some police officials were indicted. Although Srinivas was not at fault, he felt responsible and this probably explains the tenacity with which Srinivas pursued Veerappan when he could have taken up softer postings elsewhere. \nIn 1987, Srinivas was transferred as DCF at Chickmangalur and within few months of his transfer, Veerappan murdered Mr Chidabaram, Range Forest Officer, Satyamangalam Range. Srinivas assisted the local administration in investigating the case. He developed a network of informers against Veerappan in his native village Gopinatham. Veerappan, however killed the informants and displayed  their heads as an example in the village. He also doled out part of his ill-gotten wealth amongst the villagers. His excellent knowledge of the terrain coupled with the silence of the villagers,  enabled him to extend his activities.\n\n\n== Treading the path of Satyanveshan ==\nAfter 1989, Veerappan took up sandalwood smuggling in a big way in the Mysuru and Coorg districts of Karnataka and the adjoining areas of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. A Special Task Force was formed to tackle Veerappan and his activities. While the task force followed the methods of aggressively patrolling the forests and raiding hideouts, Srinivas adopted the unconventional strategy of building goodwill with people who helped Veerappan. He evolved the concept of  Satyanveshan from the ideas of two people who inspired him - Lok Nayak Jayaprakash Narayan and Acharya Vinoba Bhave, concentrating on non-violent methods of persuasion to change the hearts of criminals and reintegrate them with society.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nAt Gopinatham, Veerappan's village, Srinivas built a temple for the Goddess Mariamman, at the cost of \u20b9 3 lakhs raised through contributions. A fixed deposit scheme was launched to pay the salaries of the temple workers as well as meet the maintenance costs of the temple. He provided drinking water to remote tribal villages in his jurisdiction; developed roads to inaccessible villages and obtained motor transport connections between these villages and nearby towns. He started a mobile dispensary for the people and even learnt basic medicine to assist in the dispensary. At Chickmangalur he planned and built a modern forest complex spread over 50 acres, comprising offices, official residences, a temple and private houses for foresters under a self-financing scheme. He took up an ambitious tribal housing programme where he built 40 houses for the homeless people of Gopinatham village. He used his own salary and borrowed from friends and relatives to finance many of these humanitarian activities. He was an outstanding forest officer committed to his job and the people he served. He raised the forest nurseries successfully in the deep forests by impounding available hill top water. He conducted afforestation drives, improved communication networks and set up high altitude watch towers. He understood that forest development and tribal development are intrinsically related.\n\n\n== Rehabilitation of criminals ==\nSrinivas organised cooperatives to sell the minor forest produce collected by the villagers. He provided livelihood to the villagers by employing them in forest nurseries and other developmental works to discourage them from destroying forest wealth and wildlife. Eligible people were identified and appointed as watchers and guards in the forest department. Veerappan's gang members were also encouraged to use these employment opportunities. As a result of Srinivas efforts, the public support base on which Veerappan thrived was eroded. Srinivas offered the gang members a rehabilitation package including legal justice if they would lay down their arms and cross over. A major breakthrough was achieved in 1990 when many of the hardcore gang members surrendered before Srinivas. Veerappan's gang dwindled from over 40 to 8-10 members. Among those surrendered was Arjuna, the younger brother of Veerappan. When they were jailed, Srinivas personally engaged advocates on their behalf and got them released on bail.\n\n\n== Last encounter with Veerapan ==\nIn July 1991, Srinivas's tenure with the STF expired. He stopped getting his salary and the security provided to him was weakened but he stayed on as he felt that Veerappan's surrender was imminent. On 9 November 1991 he received a wireless message at MM Hills that Veerappan was ready to surrender if Srinivas met him unaccompanied and unarmed. Without hesitation Srinivas set out alone the same night. He met Arjuna who had been missing for over a month, at Ponnuswamy Palli (Veerappan's uncle) house, stayed the night and left for the encounter in the morning. The last message received from him said, \"We are hoping for the best. God will help us\" Instead on 10 November 1991, 37-year-old Srinivas was beheaded from behind while crossing a creek 6 km from Gopinatham village.\n\n\n== Award of Kirti Chakra ==\nThe State Government announced a reward of \u20b9 10 lakh (10,00,000rupees) and recommended him for the Presidential Gallantry Award. He was given a State funeral with gun salute and police honours. On 26 January 1992, Srinivas was posthumously awarded the second highest peace time gallantry award the Kirti Chakra, received by his mother from the President of India at the Defence Investiture Ceremony held at Rashtrapathi Bhavan. For Srinivas, the most fitting tribute came from the fact that grief over his death was most palpable at Gopinatham village where he was seen not a mere government functionary but as a social reformer.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nIn 2016, Killing Veerappan was scheduled to be released on 27 May 2016\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Recommerce": "Recommerce or reverse commerce is the selling of previously owned, new or used products, mainly electronic devices or media such as books, through physical or online distribution channels to buyers who repair, if necessary, then reuse, recycle or resell them.\n\n\n== History of the term ==\nIn February 2005, George F. Colony, the head of Forrester Research introduced the term recommerce in response to a question about the technology spending trends after the Dot-com bubble: \"There's a lot of shelf-life issues out there. People are a couple of releases behind. Older PCs. There is a move to really go back to \u2014 we call it 'recommerce'. Instead of 'ecommerce', it's 'recommerce'\". He said.The term is now primarily used to describe businesses which resell used goods. Most of them focus on consumer electronics, such as smartphones, tablets, and notebooks.  Physical media, such as books, DVDs, and blue ray discs are also significant.\nWhile there have long been channels for selling used goods, such as garage sales and flea markets, online platforms such as eBay or craigslist allow individuals to sell used goods much more efficiently.\nBeginning in the early 2000s, companies that professionalized the industry by offering professional buyback or trade-in schemes started to thrive: consumers could sell their old smartphones, TVs, or computers to offset the cost of a new one.  This has been common practice with car sales for decades.\nCompanies such as Gazelle, Rebag, and ThredUp started in the 2000s to offer purchasing and trade-in services completely separate from the purchase of new items and further spread the term.\n\n\n== Different Types of Recommerce ==\n\n\n=== Informal Market ===\nConsumers that sell used goods directly person to person (such as flea markets, garage sales or ad hoc) or via Marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. Hereby some platforms such as eBay may hedge the risk of the payment for the consumer by providing payment tools such as PayPal or just offer the possibility to market the product such as craigslist.\n\n\n=== Trade-In & Recommerce Services ===\nAn increasing amount of transactions occur directly via specialised service companies that purchase used goods, refurbish them if necessary and resell them subsequently. Such platforms often provide initial indications of the final purchase price for the good.\nMost platforms assist the user during the transaction by offering following services:\n\nAn indication of the final purchase price to the owner of the product sold (often the final price varies as the consumer cannot verify to the full extend all determining factors of the product sold such as the quality of the battery of a smartphone during the process);\nBy organizing the logistical return of the product;\nBy controlling the product's condition in a specialized workshop;\nBy recycling the good if it can't be used anymore.This kind of resale allows sellers to overcome some marketplaces drawbacks, by providing a means of simplified acquisition, and immediate and sometimes guarantied value.\n\n\n=== Buy Back & Trade-In Offers by Vendors of new Products ===\nEspecially in the electronics sector the purchase and buyback of consumer electronics became very common in recent years. By today all major MNO offer Trade-In solutions combined or detached from the purchase of a new phone.\nMost of this services are offered by 3rd party refurbishing companies specialised in used electronics.\n\n\n== Types of purchased products ==\nExamples of the main assets of companies acquired by recommerce include:\nConsumer non-durables: disposable razors, jeans, corks, pantyhose, eyeglasses, watches\nCultural goods: books, CDs, DVDs\nJewelry: gold, silver\nTechnological devices: cellphones, smartphones, tablet computers, TVs, video game consoles, GPS devices, cameras, video cameras\nClothes & unwanted fashion items and accessories; handbags, small goods\nOver the counter (OTC) medical supplies, particularly Diabetes testing supplies such as glucose test strips and lancetsMany ecommerce services have introduced recommerce solutions, including distributors, online retailers, and chain retailers.\n\n\n== The various marketing positions recommerce ==\nMultiple types of recommerce services are available:\n\nRecommerce, used as a method of funding, which can compensate the seller in cash or with a voucher.\nSolidarity recommerce, the return of products by offering its holders an opportunity to share or redistribute the residual value with a non-profit organization or a social cause (e.g., micro-credit, or insertion).\nEcological recommerce, the recycling or proper disposal of products with strong polluting capacity (providing repair or recycling regulatory compliance).\n\n\n== Positive Impact of Recommerce ==\n\n\n=== Environment ===\nEnvironmental reports by electronics manufactures show that the majority of natural resources for the production of such products are consumed during manufacturing and first transport of the product and not during the use of a product. In many cases the reuse of such a good is significantly more beneficial than the pure recycling as eventual logistics and energy consumptions during the recycling don't occur and a used product can be resold instead of a new product being produced. The reuse of a product is an effective means of reducing products' environmental footprint.\n\n\n=== Consumer Purchase Power ===\nThe product holder increases its purchasing power to acquire a new product by selling back its old one.\n\n\n== The development factors ==\nSeveral factors have greatly accelerated the development of recommerce in developed countries, including:\nThe demand for solutions enabling consumers to separate themselves ethically from their products,\nThe ease of use of recommerce services, and more importantly,\nThe preponderance of takeover bids, which handsomely compensate the owners of recommerce services.In France, the rise of recommerce is partly supported by the \"Grenelle II\" Law, which states that when they are sold under the brand name of a single dealer, it must \"provide or contribute to the collection, removal and treatment of electrical and electronic equipment waste instead of the person who manufactures, imports or brings in the domestic market (...) this equipment regardless of the selling technique, including distance selling and electronic sales\".\n\n\n== Issues of recommerce ==\nRecommerce requires a special organization of many functions, such as: logistics management, information systems, customer relations, price control and treatment of the product in the shop, promotion, retention, and resale.  Functional products recovered via recommerce solutions are usually put back on the market by the recommercer. Moreover, when this product exceeds local demand, recommercers sometimes turn to foreign markets to sell the products they have purchased.  Thus, the recommercer sells some of these used functional products in emerging markets where access to technology and accelerating economic development are reserved for some part of the population.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Related articles ===\nE-commerce\nRecycling\nReuse\nTrade in services\nWaste Management\nReseller\nUsed good\nSustainability",

    "The Green Room (film)": "Green Room is a 2015 American horror-thriller film written and directed by Jeremy Saulnier, and produced by Neil Kopp, Victor Moyers and Anish Savjani. Starring Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole, Imogen Poots and Patrick Stewart, the film focuses on a punk band who find themselves attacked by neo-Nazi skinheads after witnessing a murder at a remote club in the Pacific Northwest. The film came from Saulnier's desire to direct a thriller set in a green room.\nPrincipal photography took place during October 2014 in Portland, Oregon. The film was financed and produced by Broad Green Pictures. Green Room was screened in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival. At the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, the film finished third in the balloting for the Grolsch People's Choice Midnight Madness Award. The film began a limited release on April 15, 2016, before being widely released on May 13 through A24. It appeared on many critics' lists as one of the best films of 2016 and received a 2017 Empire Award nomination for Best Horror, but grossed just $3 million against a budget of $5 million.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nD.C. punk band the Ain't Rights\u2014Pat, Sam, Reece, and Tiger\u2014are travelling the Pacific Northwest, low on funds. After their gig is cancelled, a radio host arranges a new show in a rural area outside Portland through his cousin, Daniel. Arriving at the venue, they realize it's a neo-Nazi skinhead bar and they're opening for a NSBM band, Cowcatcher. They go ahead with the show anyway. During their set, Pat notes two young women, Emily and Amber, looking disturbed and being shepherded out of sight.\nAs the band is about to leave, Pat returns to the bar's green room to retrieve Sam's cellphone, where he stumbles upon Amber and the members of Cowcatcher standing over the body of Emily, who's been stabbed to death by Werm. Pat calls the police as he flees, but is caught, and bar employees Gabe and Big Justin capture the rest of the band and confine them in the green room with Amber. Gabe pays one young skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to Pat's call. He consults with the bar's owner, skinhead leader Darcy, who decides all witnesses need to be eliminated. He arranges for Cowcatcher to be gifted poisoned heroin, while more skinheads assemble at the bar, waiting until nightfall to kill the band and Amber. \nThe band overpowers Big Justin and holds him hostage, taking his pistol and a boxcutter from his pocket. They negotiate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the pistol. Pat agrees, on the condition that they keep the bullets, but when he opens the door, the men attempt to force their way in while slashing at his arm. They manage to close the door, however Pat loses the gun and is seriously injured. Big Justin attempts to break free, leading Reece to choke him unconscious. In response, Amber slashes his stomach open with the boxcutter.\nThe band tears up the floorboards and discovers a drug lab under the bar, but the only exit is locked from the outside. Arming themselves with improvised weapons, they attempt to fight their way out. Neo-Nazi Clark unleashes a fighting dog which kills Tiger. Amber and Pat drive the dog away with microphone feedback. Reece escapes through a window, only to be stabbed to death by Alan. Pat, Amber, and Sam retreat to the green room. \nDaniel arrives and Darcy sends him in to kill the remaining survivors, claiming they murdered Emily, his girlfriend. However, he instead talks to them, and Amber explains that Werm murdered Emily after discovering she and Daniel were planning to leave the skinhead life. Daniel agrees to help them escape, but as they venture back out into the bar, he is shot dead by the bartender. Pat kills the bartender and the group takes his shotgun, only to find themselves confronted by the full skinhead force. Sam mortally wounds Clark's dog with the shotgun before it kills her, and Amber is shot as she and Pat once again retreat to the green room.\nWith the sun rising soon, Darcy has most of the skinheads disperse, taking Clark and Alan with him to stage the band's deaths to make it look as if they were killed while trespassing on his property. Gabe prepares to clean up the bar, while Jonathan and Kyle are dispatched with the dog to finish off Pat and Amber, who formulate a plan for a last stand. They again use microphone feedback to scare off the dog before Pat lures Jonathan into the drug lab. As Kyle stands watch in the green room, Amber emerges from under the cushions of the couch and ambushes him, cutting his throat with the boxcutter. Pat and Jonathan fight, and Amber sneaks up and shoots Jonathan in the head. Gabe enters the green room to find his companions dead, and surrenders to Pat and Amber.\nHolding Gabe at gunpoint, they trek through the woods. As they near Darcy's house, Pat and Amber decide to go after him, while Gabe goes to a nearby farm to call the authorities. Pat and Amber kill Clark and Alan before confronting Darcy. Fleeing, Darcy pulls a revolver but is shot dead. Their ammunition and energy spent, Pat and Amber sit on the side of the road, waiting for the police.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nAnton Yelchin as Pat, the bassist of the Ain't Rights\nImogen Poots as Amber, Emily's friend\nAlia Shawkat as Sam, the guitarist of the Ain't Rights\nJoe Cole as Reece, the drummer of the Ain't Rights\nCallum Turner as Tiger, the singer of the Ain't Rights\nPatrick Stewart as Darcy Banker, the leader of the skinheads\nMacon Blair as Gabe, a skinhead and club employee\nMark Webber as Daniel, a skinhead and Tad's cousin in a relationship with Emily\nKai Lennox as Clark, a skinhead and dogfight breeder\nEric Edelstein as Big Justin, a skinhead bouncer\nDavid W.

Saulnier created a short film set in one as part of a 48-hour film challenge in 2007 which involved the supernatural and according to Saulnier \nwas \"Really kind of fun and hammy.\" However, he still wanted a chance to do his green room movie \"the right way\". Although the film features a large amount of violence and what Saulnier calls \"full frontal gore\", he has gone on record as stating that it is not \"sadistic\", and that every act of violence apart from the initiating incident is done with a reason.  As such Saulnier made sure that there were no \"gratuitous close ups\" of recently deceased characters.On May 22, 2014, it was announced that Broad Green Pictures would finance and produce the film directed and written by Jeremy Saulnier, with Film Science. Anish Savjani, Neil Kopp and Victor Moyers would produce the film. On October 16, Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots joined the lead cast of the film, along with Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner, Joe Cole, Macon Blair and Mark Webber. On October 21, Patrick Stewart was added to the cast to play Darcy Banker, the leader of a violent white supremacist group, while other cast includes Kai Lennox, Eric Edelstein and Taylor Tunes.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nPrincipal photography began in October 2014 in Portland, Oregon. The location for Tad's house was in Astoria, Oregon, on the Oregon coast, and the forest scenes were filmed in the Mount Hood National Forest.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nSaulnier, who used to play in a hardcore punk band called \"No Turn on Fred,\" wanted the film to \"stand the test of real musicians scrutinizing every frame.\" He enlisted Hutch Harris of American indie rock band The Thermals to teach the actors the musical parts that they would be performing onscreen. The film's soundtrack is largely populated by heavy metal artists like Midnight rather than white nationalist bands. Saulnier says that he wanted the club to have a Mot\u00f6rhead-like atmosphere, but that he had no intention of financially supporting white nationalist artists.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nIn addition to the songs appearing on the soundtrack, Green Room features several other punk and metal tracks, including Fear's \"Legalize Drugs\" (1995), Napalm Death's \"Suffer the Children\" (1990), Obituary's \"Paralyzed with Fear\" (2014), Poison Idea's \"Taken By Surprise\" (1990), Slayer's \"War Ensemble\" (1990), and Bad Brains' \"Right Brigade\" (1982).\n\n\n== Release ==\n\n\n=== Box office ===\nOn October 29, 2014, WestEnd Films acquired the international rights to the film. The film had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2015. Shortly after, it was announced A24 Films had acquired distribution rights to the film. The film screened on opening night of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, on September 10, 2015.The film was originally to open in a limited release on April 1, 2016, before opening in a wide release on April 15, 2016. However, it was moved to April 15, in limited release, and May 13 wide. According to Box Office Mojo, Green Room opened at #30 in its limited release, premiering in 3 theaters, culminating over $87,984. In its official wide release, the film premiered at 777 theaters, taking the #16 rank on opening weekend, and grossing more than $411,376.\n\n\n=== Critical response ===\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on 241 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Green Room delivers unapologetic genre thrills with uncommon intelligence and powerfully acted \u00e9lan.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times praised Patrick Stewart, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat and Macon Blair's performances and called the film \"a wonderfully nasty, gruesome, jagged-edge gem of a horror film\" that has \"first-rate\" cinematography, set design, soundtrack, and editing. Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail awarded it a full four stars and wrote, \"Jeremy Saulnier (Murder Party, Blue Ruin) continues one of the best streaks in independent horror with this terrifying and inventive thriller.\" Lenika Cruz of The Atlantic said it's \"a tense gore-fest, one that\u2019s as grimy and claustrophobic as the titular room. But scrape off the scum, and you\u2019ll find Green Room full of visual artistry, dark humor, smart writing, and glints of humanity\". IGN awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying, \"This follow-up to the brilliant Blue Ruin pits a rock band against white supremacists with ace, ultra-violent results.\"Jeffrey Bloomer of Slate favorably compared the film's \"genre maturity\", \"amoral survivalism and malleable sense of good and evil\", \"brutal efficiency\" and \"weary humor\" to John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 and praised the cast, writing \"If the world knows any justice[...] then the Screen Actors Guild will remember this cast when it doles out its awards next year\". James Berardinelli concludes the film is \"for anyone who enjoys sitting through 90 tense minutes and feeling the attendant adrenaline rush. It\u2019s like a well-constructed horror movie\" that's \"As intimate as it is unnerving\". Guy Lodge of Variety called it \"a technically sharp backwoods horror-thriller that lacks a human element\".  Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that it's entertaining but \"less disciplined, less original and less memorable work than Blue Ruin\".\n\n\n==== Accolades ====\n\n\n==== Top ten lists ====\nGreen Room was listed on many film critics' top ten lists.\n\n\n=== Home media ===\nLionsgate, as the home media distributor of A24 releases, released Green Room on Blu-ray and DVD on July 12, 2016. The end credits of the film's home media and subsequent releases feature an addended dedication to the memory of star Yelchin, who died on June 19, 2016.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nGreen Room at IMDb\nGreen Room at Box Office Mojo\nGreen Room at Rotten Tomatoes\nGreen Room at Metacritic",

    "African Jackson Cemetery": "The African Jackson Cemetery is a historic cemetery in the western part of the U.S. state of Ohio.  Formed by a colony of more than 300 freedmen from Virginia, who were freed in the will of John Randolph of Roanoke, it has been the resting place for many. Active into the 20th century, it is one of the last extant physical remnants of Rossville, a black settlement founded near the city of Piqua in the late 1840s. The cemetery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its connection to the history of free people of color in pre-Civil War Ohio.\n\n\n== History ==\nBeginning in the 1820s, Virginia planter John Randolph of Roanoke, a US Congressman, wrote a succession of wills in which he planned for the manumission of his more than 600 slaves, together with providing money to relocate the freedmen to the free state of Ohio and buy land for them. He contradicted himself in various documents and failed to provide clear direction regarding which will was to be followed.  Following his death in 1833, lawsuits were quickly filed to challenge probate of his estate, and twelve years passed before the litigation was finished and his 600 slaves' futures were resolved. As ultimately resolved by the courts, his will provided for his slaves' emancipation and transportation to a free state, and western Ohio was chosen as their destination.:\u200a1002\u200aMoney from Randolph's estate was used to buy 2,000 acres (810 ha) in Mercer County, but the area was home to the freedmen for only a short while. They left due to hostility and discrimination by the whites living in the region. Some 383 freedmen migrated southward to Miami and Shelby counties. They developed the Randolph Slave Settlement, located just north of Piqua at Rossville, as one of many rural black settlements in pre-Civil War Ohio.:\u200a1002\u200a Churches had been established in Rossville as early as 1815, but the new settlers ultimately founded their own church in 1864, a Baptist congregation. Within the following decade, they established their own cemetery (1866) and school (1872). In contrast to the white Baptist cemetery, which was abandoned and thoroughly derelict by 1880, their African Jackson Cemetery was active well into the twentieth century.By the early 1980s, comparatively little remained of the black settlement at Rossville;:\u200a1002\u200a it had been absorbed by Piqua. The nearby York Rial House has been documented as the home of a prominent member of this black community.:\u200a1016\u200a The cemetery is the chief surviving physical remainder of the community. For this reason, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982,:\u200a1002\u200a and the York Rial House was added in 1986.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "North Korea crisis": "The 2017\u201318 North Korea crisis was a period of heightened tension between North Korea and the United States throughout 2017, which began when North Korea conducted a series of missile and nuclear tests that demonstrated the country's ability to launch ballistic missiles beyond its immediate region and suggested that North Korea's nuclear weapons capability was developing at a faster rate than had been assessed by the U.S. intelligence community.This, as well as a regular joint U.S.\u2013South Korea military exercise undertaken in August 2017 and U.S. threats, raised international tensions in the region and beyond. During 2017, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in early September, and heated rhetoric was exchanged, stoking fears about a possible war.\nWhile the tensions were mostly with the United States, North Korea threatened Australia twice with nuclear strikes throughout 2017, accusing them of siding with the U.S. and 'blindly' following them.By the beginning of 2018, however, tensions began to ease dramatically, with North Korea announcing the restoration of the Seoul\u2013Pyongyang hotline and agreeing to hold talks with South Korea about participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Diplomatic activity flourished during the next few months, with the suspension of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, and the 2018 inter-Korean summit in late April which culminated in the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration on 27 April 2018. An unprecedented bilateral summit between Kim and Trump was held in Singapore on 12 June 2018. It resulted in a joint declaration calling for the \"full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula\". A second summit between Kim and Trump took place in Hanoi, Vietnam on 27\u201328 February 2019. Though talks there broke down, a third summit took place in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on 30 June 2019, with Trump becoming the first US leader to visit North Korea. Follow-up talks later in 2019, however, broke down within hours.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\n=== North Korea's nuclear weapons program ===\n\nIn his New Year's Day speech on January 2, 2017, Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, said that the country was in the \"last stage\" of preparations to test-fire an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).On May 3, North Korea issued a rare and harshly worded criticism of its chief ally, China, stating that \"One must clearly understand that the D.P.R.K.'s line of access to nukes for the existence and development of the country can neither be changed nor shaken[...] And that the D.P.R.K. will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is... China should no longer try to test the limits of the D.P.R.K.'s patience[...] China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the D.P.R.K.-China relations.\" The harsh commentary also accused the Chinese media (which is tightly controlled by the government) of dancing to the tune of the U.S.In early August 2017, The Washington Post reported an assessment, made by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency in July 2017, which said that North Korea had successfully developed nuclear warheads for missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland (a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles).\n\n\n=== Sanctions on North Korea; trade with China ===\n\nSince North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006, the UN Security Council had passed a number of resolutions that imposed various sanctions on the DPRK, including restrictions on economic activity. Nevertheless, North Korea's gross domestic product grew by an estimated 3.9 percent in 2016, to about $28.5 billion, the fastest pace in 17 years; the progress was largely attributed to continued trade with China, which accounted for more than 90% of North Korea's international trade.In late February 2017, following North Korea's February 12 test of the Pukkuksong-2 medium-range ballistic missile, China, which regards its trade with North Korea and the putative missile threat to the U.S. as separate issues, said it would comply with UN Resolution 2321 and halt all coal imports (North Korea's main export) from North Korea. The halt notwithstanding, in April 2017, China said that its trade with North Korean had expanded. In July 2017, China's trade with North Korea, while the ban on North Korean coal was said to have slowed imports from the DPRK, was worth $456 million, up from $426 million in July 2016, the year-to-date trade being up 10.2 percent at $3.01 billion.In 2017, North Korea was sanctioned several times by the UN Security Council. The latest ones were imposed on December 22, 2017. According to this resolution, oil supplies to the DPRK are prohibited, and all countries have decided to expel North Korean labor migrants from the territories of the countries where they work within 24 months.China has been opposed to secondary sanctions that may be imposed on Chinese firms that do business with North Korea.\n\n\n=== Imprisonment of U.S. citizens ===\n\nAmerican university student Otto Warmbier was freed from North Korea in June 2017, while in a coma after nearly 18 months of captivity. Warmbier died without regaining consciousness on June 19, 2017, six days after his return to the United States. Some U.S. officials blamed North Korea for his death. In July 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson authorized a \"Geographical Travel Restriction\" which banned Americans from entering North Korea.\n\n\n=== THAAD in South Korea ===\n\nOstensibly to counter North Korea's missile threat, United States Forces Korea (USFK) had been planning deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) in South Korea, which is designed to detect and destroy intermediate- and medium-range ballistic missiles (not intercontinental ballistic missile). The deployment had faced strong oppositions from China, Russia, and North Korea. In late April 2017, it was reported that while THAAD had originally been scheduled to become operational by the end of 2017, this could occur sooner. According to U.S. Forces Korea's announcement, THAAD stationed in South Korea had reached initial operating capability (IOC) on May 1, 2017.\n\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n\n=== USS Carl Vinson's movements: April 2017 ===\n\nFollowing North Korea's test-firing of a medium-range ballistic missile from its eastern port of Sinpo into the Sea of Japan on April 5, which came a month after four ballistic missiles were fired towards the Sea of Japan, tensions increased as U.S. president Donald Trump had said the U.S. was prepared to act alone to deal with the nuclear threat from North Korea. On April 9, the U.S. Navy announced it was sending a navy strike group headed by the  supercarrier USS Carl Vinson to the West Pacific (\"to sail north and report on station in the Western Pacific Ocean after departing Singapore April 8\"), but due to apparent miscommunication inside the U.S. administration, the naval move was presented as one towards the Korean peninsula. This information was backtracked by the U.S. government a few days later.The April 9 announcement by the Navy led to a \"glitch-ridden sequence of events\". On April 17, North Korea's deputy United Nations ambassador accused the United States of turning the Korean peninsula into \"the world's biggest hotspot\" and the North Korean government stated \"its readiness to declare war on the United States if North Korean forces were to be attacked.\" In reality on April 18, Carl Vinson and its escorts were 5,600 kilometres (3,500 mi) from Korea engaged in scheduled joint Royal Australian Navy exercises in the Indian Ocean. On April 24 the Japanese destroyers Ashigara and Samidare participated with Carl Vinson in tactical training drills near the Philippines; North Korea threatened to sink her with a single strike. Carl Vinson had been in the South China Sea in 2015 and again in February 2017 on routine patrols. In late April 2017, Trump stated that \"[t]here is a chance that we [the United States] could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea\".On April 24, North Korea marked the 85th anniversary of the Korean People's Army by what was said to be \"its largest ever military drill,\" conducted in Wonsan. The following day, it was reported that the United States and South Korea had begun installing key elements of the THAAD missile defense in South Korea's Seongju County.\n\n\n=== ICBM test-flight on 4 July ===\n\nOn July 4 North Korea conducted the first publicly announced flight test of its ICBM Hwasong-14, timed to coincide with the U.S. Independence Day celebrations. This flight had a claimed range of 933 kilometres (580 mi) eastwards into the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea) and reached an altitude of 2,802 kilometres (9,193,000 ft) during a 39-minute flight. The U.S. government experts classified the missile launch as a big step in Pyongyang's quest to acquire a nuclear-tipped weapon capable of hitting the U.S. North Korea declared it was now \"a full-fledged nuclear power that has been possessed of the most powerful inter-continental ballistic rocket capable of hitting any part of the world\".USFK said in a statement dated July 4, 2017: \"Eighth U.S. Army and Republic of Korea (ROK) military personnel conducted a combined event exercising assets countering North Korea's destabilizing and unlawful actions on July 4.\" South Korea's Hyunmoo-2B and U.S. Army Tactical Missile System missiles were launched during the drill.\n\n\n=== Rhetorical escalation in August 2017 ===\nOn August 8, 2017, President Donald Trump warned that North Korean nuclear threats would \"be met with fire, fury and frankly power, the likes of which the world has never seen before,\" after the mass media reported that a US intelligence assessment had found that the country had successfully produced a miniaturised nuclear warhead capable of fitting inside its missiles. President Trump also remarked of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un: \"He has been very threatening beyond a normal state.\" Within hours, North Korea responded by announcing that it was considering attacking U.S. military bases in the US territory of Guam.On August 10, 2017, North Korean Lt. Gen. Kim Rak-gyom responded to Trump's speech of \"fire and fury,\" saying his words were \"nonsense\" and asserting that \"reasonable dialogue\" wasn't possible with Trump as president of the US. The North Korean governmental news agency KCNA reported that Kim Jong-un's military was considering a plan to fire four ICBMs, type Hwasong-12, into the Philippine Sea just 30\u201340 kilometers away from the island Guam. The flight time of missiles was estimated to be exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds. A report by the KCNA suggested the plan would be put into operation in mid-August. U.S. officials stated that Joseph Y. Yun, the US envoy for North Korea policy, and Pak Song-il, a senior North Korean diplomat at the country's UN mission, were making regular contact during this dispute, through a conduit of communication they called the New York channel.On August 11, Trump wrote on Twitter: \"Military solutions are now fully in place,[ ]locked and loaded,[ ]should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path!\" Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton and former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated that the standoff between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program was comparable to the Cuban Missile Crisis.Bob Woodward, in his 2020 book Rage, quoted Mike Pompeo as saying the national security team \"never knew whether it was real, or whether it was a bluff\", and reported that Jim Mattis slept fully dressed due to concerns about a North Korean attack.On August 14, Ukraine's Chairman of the National Security and Defense Council, Oleksandr Turchynov denied that it had ever supplied defense technology to North Korea, responding to an article in the New York Times that said North Korea might have purchased rocket engines from Ukrainian factory Yuzhmash, who have also denied the report.On August 15, the North Korean leader said he was delaying a decision on firing missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam while he waits to see what Trump does next.From August 21\u201331, the U.S. and South Korea conducted the 2017 Ulchi-Freedom Guardian exercise that was billed by U.S. Forces Korea as slightly smaller than the previous year's, with 17,500 U.S. troops participating; an editorial carried by North Korea's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper condemned the drills as \"the most explicit expression of hostility against us.\"On August 25, North Korea fired three missiles from Kangwon Province in the southeastern part of the country. According to Cmdr. Dave Benham of US Pacific Command, one of the missiles exploded on launch while the other two suffered critical failures in flight, splashing down in the Sea of Japan after flying a distance of 250 kilometers (160 mi).\n\n\n==== Missile test over Japan on 29 August ====\nOn August 29, just before 6 am JST, North Korea launched a missile which flew over Hokkaido, Japan. The missile reached an altitude of 550 km (340 mi) and flew a total distance of around 2,700 km (1,700 mi) before crashing into the Pacific. The missile was not shot down by the Japanese military. This was the third time, with two prior events in 1998 and 2009, that a North Korean missile had passed over Japanese territory. However, in both of those prior cases, North Korea had claimed that they were launching satellites. The missile prompted activation of the J-Alert warning system in Tohoku and Hokkaido, advising people to seek shelter. The launch was scheduled on the 107th anniversary of the Japan-Korea annexation treaty, and KCNA said that it was \"a bold plan to make the cruel Japanese islanders insensible on bloody August 29.\" The missile launched was said to have followed a much flatter trajectory than those tested earlier in 2017.An emergency UN Security Council meeting was called for later that day to discuss the event. In a statement issued by the White House in response to the launch, US President Donald Trump said that \"All options are on the table\" regarding North Korea.\n\n\n==== U.S. response at the end of August ====\nOn August 30, President Trump issued a statement via Twitter saying \"The U.S. has been talking to North Korea and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!\" However, when asked by reporters at a meeting with South Korean Defense Minister Song Young-Moo whether diplomacy was off the table, US Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated that \"We're never out of diplomatic solutions\" and \"We always look for more. We're never complacent.\"On August 31, the US flew a squadron of bombers, including two B-1Bs and four F-35s, and conducted bombing drills in what US Pacific Command described as a \"direct response to North Korea's intermediate range ballistic missile launch,\" referring to North Korea's IRBM launch on August 29.\n\n\n=== Sixth nuclear test and aftermath: September 2017 ===\n\nOn September 3, at 3:31 am UTC, the United States Geological Survey reported that it had detected a magnitude 6.3 earthquake in North Korea near the Punggye-ri test site. Given the shallow depth of the quake and its proximity to North Korea's primary nuclear weapons testing facility, experts concluded that the country had conducted a sixth nuclear weapon test since the country first exploded a nuclear device in 2006. North Korea claimed that they had tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being mounted on an ICBM. The independent seismic monitoring agency NORSAR estimated that the blast had a yield of around 120 kilotons. An official KCNA statement of September 3, also claimed North Korea's ability to conduct a \"super-powerful EMP attack\".On the same day, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis speaking on behalf of the White House, warned there would be \"a massive military response\" to any threat from North Korea against the United States, including Guam, or its allies.Early on September 4, the Republic of Korea (South Korea) conducted a ballistic missile exercise that involved the South's Hyunmoo ballistic missile and the F-15K fighter jets, which was billed to be in response to North's detonation. The state news agency Yonhap said the South's military had carried out a live-fire exercise simulating an attack on the North's nuclear site, hitting \"designated targets in the East Sea\".On the same day, the UN Security Council convened to discuss further measures against North Korea; the leaked draft the relevant UNSC resolution prepared by the U.S. was said to call for an oil embargo on North Korea, ban on the country's exports of textiles, on the hiring of North Korean workers abroad as well as personal sanctions against Kim Jong-un. Despite resistance from China and Russia, the United States on 8 September formally requested a vote of the United Nations Security Council on the U.S. resolution. UNSC 2375 passed on September 11 as a significantly watered-down version of the United States' request.In an interview on September 4, Liu Jieyi, China's ambassador to the United Nations, called for dialogue, saying that the issue needed to be resolved \"peacefully\". He said, \"China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula.\"President Vladimir Putin speaking to the Chinese press on September 5, 2017, described U.S. proposals for further sanctions on Pyongyang as \"useless\"; he said, \"Ramping up military hysteria in such conditions is senseless; it's a dead end.\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has likened the war of words between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to a kindergarten fight between two children, saying \"Together with China we'll continue to strive for a reasonable approach and not an emotional one like when children in a kindergarten start fighting and no-one can stop them.\"A plan proposed by both China and Russia calls for a joint freeze (freeze-for-freeze) \u2013 of North's missile tests, and U.S. and South Korean military exercises; the next step would be starting talks. The joint initiative of Russia and China envisages the involved parties' commitment to \"four nos\": concerning regime change, regime collapse, accelerated reunification, and military deployment north of the thirty-eighth parallel.On September 6, Donald Trump, after a telephone conversation with China's Xi Jinping, said that the United States would not tolerate North Korea's provocations, although military action was not his \"first choice\".On September 10, the Secretary General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Jens Stoltenberg said in an interview with BBC television: \"The reckless behavior of North Korea is a global threat and requires a global response and that of course also includes NATO\"; when asked whether an attack on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam would trigger NATO's Article 5, he said: \"I will not speculate about whether Article 5 will be applied in such a situation.\"\n\n\n==== Missile test over Japan on September 15 ====\nOn September 14, North Korea issued a threat to \"sink\" Japan, and turn the US to \"ashes and darkness\". The statement drew strong condemnation from Yoshihide Suga, who described the speech as \"extremely provocative and egregious\". The next day, an IRBM was fired from near Pyongyang and flew over Hokkaido, Japan before splashing down in the western Pacific about two thousand kilometers off Cape Erimo at about 7:16 am local time.\nThe missile traveled 3,700 kilometers (2,300 mi) achieving a maximum apogee of 770 kilometres (480 mi) during its 19-minute flight. It was the furthest any North Korean IRBM missile has gone above and beyond Japan. On September 18, North Korea announced that any further sanctions would only cause acceleration of their nuclear program.\n\n\n==== U.S. and China agree on \"pressure\" ====\nOn September 18, the White House said president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping had discussed North Korea's continued nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests and committed to \"maximising pressure on North Korea through vigorous enforcement\" of UN Security Council resolutions on North Korea; North Korea said the sanctions would accelerate its nuclear program.\n\n\n==== Trump's speech at UN GA, and Kim Jong-un's response ====\n\nOn September 19, Donald Trump, in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, said that the United States: \"if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man [Kim Jong-un] is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States are ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary.\" Also, without mentioning it by name, Donald Trump criticized China for maintaining relations with NK, calling it \"an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict\".On September 20, U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order that further toughened U.S. sanctions against North Korea: the U.S. Treasury was thereby authorized to target firms and financial institutions conducting business with NK. Commenting on the executive order, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, \"Foreign financial institutions are now on notice that going forward they can choose to do business with the United States or North Korea, but not both.\"On September 21, responding directly for the first time to President Trump's threat, North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in his capacity of Chairman of State Affairs of DPRK called Trump a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard\" (Korean: \ub299\ub2e4\ub9ac \ubbf8\uce58\uad11\uc774, romanized: Neukdari michigwangi, lit.\u2009'Old man lunatic') and vowed the \"highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history.\" (The ad hominem insults aside, no reference was made to the \"hostile policy\" of the United States, a staple of North Korean statements otherwise.) Foreign minister Ri Yong-ho likewise alluded to Trump as a barking dog, and furthermore remarked that North Korea might be considering the largest test of a hydrogen bomb ever in the Pacific Ocean, which would constitute the first atmospheric nuclear test in the world since 1980 (last performed by China).On September 25, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused Trump of declaring war on his country, referring to Trump's recent tweet that North Korea \"won't be around much longer.\" The White House responded that the United States has not declared war.\nOn September 30, Rex Tillerson stated while on a trip to China, that the U.S. and North Korea were in \"direct contact\". \"We have lines of communications to Pyongyang\" he said, \"We're not in a dark situation\". He further stated that the U.S. was \"probing\" the possibility of direct talks. \"So stay tuned\". The Associated Press has claimed that a long-used back-channel has been re-opened in the past months, the 'New York Channel', facilitating communication between Washington and Pyongyang. The next day however, Trump made a series of posts on Twitter which seemed to undermine Tillerson's efforts, claiming that Tillerson was \"wasting his time\" trying to negotiate with North Korea and that \"we'll do what has to be done\".Former CIA Director John O. Brennan, during a Q&A session at Fordham University on October 18, remarked that \"I think the prospects of military conflict in the Korean peninsula are greater than they have been in several decades... I don't think it's likely or probable, but if it's a 1-in-4 or 1-in-5 chance, that's too high.\"\n\n\n==== Argument about nuclear armament of South Korea and Japan ====\nAn argument emerged in both South Korea and Japan about the nuclear option, driven by worry that the United States might hesitate to defend the countries if doing so might provoke a missile launched from the North at major U.S. cities. In South Korea, polls show that 60 percent of the population favors building nuclear weapons, and that nearly 70 percent want the United States to reintroduce tactical nuclear weapons, which were withdrawn in 1991. In October, Hong Jun-pyo, one of the leading South Korean opposition figures, argued \"only by deploying tactical nuclear weapons on South Korean territory can we negotiate with North Korea on an equal footing.\" Republican Senator John McCain urged that the U.S. should consider deploying nuclear weapons to South Korea. Former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger mentioned \"If North Korea continues to have nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons must spread in the rest of Asia.\"\n\n\n==== Armistice violation in early November 2017 ====\n\nOn November 13, North Korean soldiers unsuccessfully attempted to prevent Oh Chong-song, a defector from crossing the border in the Joint Security Area. The UN Command stated that North Korean soldiers had violated the armistice agreement by firing more than 40 shots in the demilitarized zone and in the case of one soldier by briefly crossing the military demarcation line.\n\n\n==== Re-listing as State Sponsor of Terrorism ====\nOn November 20, 2017, Trump officially announced re-listing North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, which called the move as a \"serious provocation\".\n\n\n=== Third ICBM test and aftermath: November 2017 ===\n\nOn November 28, North Korea conducted its third intercontinental ballistic missile test, marking the end of a two-month span in which no missile tests were conducted.  Photos of Hwasong-15 show the missile's booster engines are two Hwasong-14 engines bundled for its first stage, as agreed by three separate analysts, Tal Inbar, Kim Dong-yub, and Chang Young-Keun.  The missile was said to have flown to a record altitude of 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) and landed in the Sea of Japan into the exclusive economic zone, a distance of 1,000 kilometres (600 mi). breaking up into three pieces. Initial assessments made by the Pentagon and subsequent analysis suggested that it was an ICBM judging by the height it traveled and, if fired on a normal trajectory, would more than be able to reach anywhere in the continental United States.  The South Korean and Japanese defense ministries also concluded that an ICBM was likely launched and that it had traveled in a lofted trajectory.  Japanese defense minister Itsunori Onodera also added that the missile broke apart into at least three pieces before it crashed into the waters located within the exclusive economic zone, indicating that the re-entry vehicle failed to survive re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. It  was launched from a larger launcher vehicle, with 9 axles, as opposed to the 8-axle vehicles purchased from China. Each of the three ICBMs launched so far have been launched from three different locations.In a press conference shortly after the launch, President Trump said regarding North Korea's ICBM launch that \"we'll handle it\".\n\n\n==== Reports of sanction violations in December 2017 ====\nIn late December 2017, it was reported that Chinese and Russian-flagged tanker ships had been observed conducting at-sea transfers of oil and petroleum products to North Korean ships over the course of the previous year, violating sanctions imposed by the US and United Nations. In posts on Twitter, Trump blasted China for defying the sanctions and continuing to support North Korea. One of these vessels, Lighthouse Winmore registered out of Hong Kong with 23 Chinese crew members, was seized by South Korean officials after reportedly delivering 600 tons of oil illegally to the North Korean vessel Sam Jong 2 in a part of the West Sea, between China and South Korea back in October.Executive Order 13722 blocks, among other items, the export of laborers which benefit the government of North Korea, or the Worker's Union Party. On 1 January 2018 The New York Times reported that as many as 147,000 workers from North Korea now work abroad, and that the Worker's Union Party of Pyongyang garnishes from 30 to 80 percent of the workers' wages. The specific businesses reported included a shipyard, a shipping container manufacturer, and greenhouses in Poland.\n\n\n=== Winter Olympics \"d\u00e9tente\" and further developments: January\u2013February 2018 ===\n\nThe crisis had caused concern about the safety of the 2018 Winter Olympics to be held in Pyeongchang in South Korea. It is widely believed that if North Korea participates in the Games, the risk of escalation diminishes. This theory was later put to the test when North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un signaled a possibility to send athletes to the Games after all in his New Year's speech for 2018, saying \"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility\". The announcement was followed by South Korean agreement to participate in the first high-level talks with the North since December 2015. The talks were scheduled for 9 January 2018. North Korea is also prepared to talk to the IOC that week. In preparation for the North\u2013South talks, the two countries restored the Seoul\u2013Pyongyang hotline, which had been inactive for almost two years, and exchanged related documents via fax. After these developments, North Korea's IOC member Chang Ung said that the participation of North Korean figure skaters again looked likely. The possibility of North Korean participation has stirred up talk about a possible Olympic boycott by the United States, after the administration of President Donald Trump, who has been at loggerheads with Kim Jong-un, has issued mixed messages. After discussions on 9 January 2018, North Korea announced they would send athletes to compete along with a delegation to attend the Winter Olympics.North and South Korea marched together in the Olympics opening ceremony and fielded a united women's ice hockey team. As well as the athletes, North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation, headed by Kim Yo-jong, sister of Kim Jong-un, and President Kim Yong-nam, and including performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The delegation passed along an invitation to President Moon to visit North Korea.According to North Korea expert Sung-Yoon Lee, North Korea's policy toward the Olympics is to enhance North Korea's status: \"One doesn't need to be a genius to see that this is what North Korea does: After having created a war-like, crisis atmosphere, (Kim [Jong-un]) takes a small step back and there's a collective sigh of relief that there's no war. It does wonders for North Korea's image.\"\n\n\n==== False alarms in Hawaii and Japan ====\n\nResidents and tourists in the U.S. state of Hawaii were briefly thrown into a panic when an emergency alert was issued January 13, 2018, advising of an imminent ballistic missile threat. Another message was sent out about 40 minutes later describing the first alert as a false alarm.Three days later in Japan, broadcasting agency NHK also accidentally sent an alert about a North Korean missile launch in error. The error was corrected in minutes.\n\n\n==== 2018 State of the Union Address ====\nIn his first State of the Union address, President Trump devoted much time to North Korea, stoking fears that an American strike was under serious consideration and not mere saber-rattling, particularly given the withdrawal of Dr. Victor Cha as Ambassador to the Republic of Korea and its similarity to George W. Bush's Axis of Evil 2002 State of the Union Address.\n\n\n==== Speculation about attack on North Korea ====\nIn mid-February, as the Olympics were ongoing, after previous media reports, the Trump administration denied considering a so-called preemptive \"bloody nose\" attack on North Korea's nuclear program. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Susan Thornton confirmed that the administration's policy remains one of \"maximum pressure\" via economic sanctions in order to get North Korea to negotiate on eliminating its nuclear weapons. Thornton however reiterated that military options are still \"on the table\" and that Pyongyang would be forced to give up its nuclear weapons \"one way or another\".\n\n\n=== Beginning of peace efforts ===\n\n\n==== Inter-Korean summits ====\n\nOn April 27, the two leaders met at the Joint Security Area, with Kim Jong-un crossing the MDL in South Korean territory, the first time a North Korean leader has done so. President Moon also briefly crossed into the North's territory. Both Moon and Kim signed the Panmunjom Declaration, declaring the Korean conflict over and to sign a proper peace treaty by the end of the year. With that, Moon agreed to visit Pyongyang in the fall.\n\n\n===== 2018 Singapore summit =====\n\nOn March 8, in a surprise departure from the hostile dialogue during 2017, Trump announced that he would meet with leader Kim Jong-un, and the two would meet likely by May. Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that \"in the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.\"\nNorth Korea accepts South Korea's proposal to hold the high-level inter-Korean talks, which took place on March 29. On May 24, President Trump cancelled the planned meeting with Chairman Kim over \"tremendous anger and open hostility\" displayed by Kim. On June 1, President Trump reversed the cancellation and confirmed that the summit would take place on June 12 as planned.Following their talks, both leaders signed a joint declaration titled \"Joint Statement of President Donald J. Trump of the United States of America and Chairman Kim Jong-un of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at the Singapore Summit\". It states:\nThe United States and the DPRK commit to establish new U.S.\u2013DPRK relations in accordance with the desire of the peoples of the two countries for peace and prosperity.\nThe United States and the DPRK will join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.\nReaffirming the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, the DPRK commits to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\nThe United States and the DPRK commit to recovering POW/MIA remains including the immediate repatriation of those already identified.\n\n\n=== Suspicion of continued nuclear program ===\nIn June 2018, NBC News reported that U.S. intelligence believed that North Korea was increasing production of enriched uranium for nuclear weapons and that, in addition to its known fuel-producing facility at Yongbyon, it had multiple secret nuclear sites. In August 2018, US officials said that North Korea could be continuing to build nuclear weapons, and days later the United Nations Security Council received reports that North Korea may not have stopped its nuclear program. The reports also claimed that North Korea was violating the UN sanctions.In late September 2018, Trump claimed that North Korea had already stopped nuclear testing, and he said that the United States would not impose any required timeline for North Korea's total denuclearization. \"I've got all the time in the world...we are not playing the 'time game.' If takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn't matter,\" Trump said. He was responding to and denying U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's claim that North Korea's denuclearization would be completed by January 2021. Trump maintained that sanctions against North Korea would stay in place until it had denuclearized.Satellite images obtained by CNN in December 2018 show that the Yeongjeo-dong long-range missile base (the existence of which was already public knowledge) remains active. The images also revealed continued construction on an underground facility and construction on a facility (the existence of which was previously unknown to the public) several kilometres from Yeongjeo-dong.\n\n\n=== 2019 Hanoi summit ===\n\nA second summit between Kim and Trump  occurred on February 27\u201328, 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2017 North Korean missile tests\n2017 North Korean nuclear test\nKorean conflict\nKorean reunification\nList of North Korean missile tests\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBakich, Spencer D.

    "Area code 785": "Area code 785 is the area code for telephone exchanges in most of northern Kansas. It was created in a split of the numbering plan area 913 on July 20, 1997, and stretches from the Colorado state line on the west to the Missouri state line on the east, while excluding the Kansas side of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which retained 913. The largest city by population in the numbering plan area is the Kansas state capital, Topeka.\n\n\n== History of area codes in Kansas ==\nWhen the area code system was created in 1947, the southern half of the state (Dodge City, Emporia, Garden City, Wichita) was designated as numbering plan area 316, while the northern half (Kansas City, Topeka, Lawrence, Goodland, Manhattan, Salina, Hays) received area code 913.\nThis configuration remained in place for 40 years.  However, by the mid-1990s, 913 was close to exhaustion due to the rapid growth of the Kansas City area, as well as the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. The latter was especially pronounced in the eastern part of the 913 territory (the Kansas City suburbs, Topeka, and Lawrence), home to the bulk of the numbering plan's available numbers.\nLate in 1996, the Kansas Corporation Commission, which oversees telecommunications in the state, requested relief from the North American Numbering Plan Administration (NANPA) for the exchanges of area code 913.  On February 12, 1997, the NANPA announced that 913 would be cut back to the Kansas side of the Kansas City area, while most of the western portion of the old 913 plan area\u2013everything from Lawrence westward\u2013was split off as area code 785, effective on July 20, 1997. Permissive dialing of 913 continued across northern Kansas until October 3, 1998.\nThe bulk of 785's landlines and cell phones are in the eastern portion, in and around Topeka and Lawrence. Despite this, 785 is nowhere near exhaustion. Under the most recent NANPA projections, northern Kansas will not need another area code for at least 30 years.Prior to October 2021, area code 785 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. This area code was therefore scheduled to transition to ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021.\n\n\n== Major cities ==\nThe principal cities in numbering plan area 785 are Colby, Goodland, Hays, Junction City, Lawrence, Manhattan, Ottawa, Salina, and Topeka.\n\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe boundary between 785 and area code 620, which covers southern Kansas outside of the Wichita metropolitan area, runs from west to east roughly following a path along K-4 and K-96.  The code boundary dips along I-135 in McPherson County and continues east to just north of Emporia in Lyon County along the Kansas Turnpike.  At this point, area code 785 reaches its easternmost boundary with the current boundary for area code 913, although a small portion of the northeast corner of Kansas across the Missouri River from St. Joseph, Missouri is part of 785.\nThe numbering plan area contains the entire counties of Anderson, Cheyenne, Franklin, Rawlins, Decatur, Norton, Phillips, Smith, Jewell, Republic, Washington, Nemaha, Marshall, Brown, Sherman, Thomas, Sheridan, Graham, Rooks, Osborne, Mitchell, Lincoln, Cloud, Ottawa, Clay, Riley, Pottawatomie, Jackson, Wallace, Logan, Gove, Trego, Ness, Rush, Ellis, Russell, Ellsworth, Saline, Dickinson, Geary, Wabaunsee, Shawnee, Osage, and Douglas, as well as portions of Doniphan, Atchison, Coffey, Lyon, Jefferson, Morris and McPherson counties.\nThe counties of  Linn, Miami, Johnson, Wyandotte, and Leavenworth belong to number plan area 913.\nOne exception to this rule is the city of Elwood, which retained the 913 area code while the rest of Doniphan County switched to 785. This is because Elwood's servicing wire center is in St. Joseph, Missouri, which is part of the Kansas City, Missouri LATA, located in area code 816. It would have been too expensive for Southwestern Bell to reroute Elwood's trunk lines so it could follow the rest of Doniphan County into 785. All bordering 816/913 rate centers have each other's area codes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNANPA area code map of Kansas \nRural Telephone (local service provider company)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nList of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 785 Area Code\nArea Code History\n1947 Area Code Assignment Plan\nList of exchanges split off from Area Code 913 to Area Code 785",
    "New Mosque, Nicosia": "The New Mosque (Turkish: Yeni Cami) is a mosque in the northern part of Nicosia. The quarter of Yeni Jami, in which it is situated, is named after the mosque.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first building at the site of the current mosque was built as a church in the Gothic style in the 14th century and converted to a mosque in 1571, after the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. Camille Enlart and George Jeffery, who undertook the first architectural examination of the remains of this building, wrote that this building could potentially be older than St. Catherine's Church, today known as the Haydar Pasha Mosque. However, following a re-examination of the architectural features, Michalis Olympios concluded that the architecture in the New Mosque must have been influenced by St Catherine's Church, not the other way around. As such, he argued that the New Mosque must have been built in the second half of the 14th century, after the construction of St Catherine's Church, which took place in the late 1350s or the early 1360s.",

    "Altruism (ethics)": "Altruism (also called the ethic of altruism, moralistic altruism, and ethical altruism) is an ethical doctrine that holds that the moral value of an individual's actions depends solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual him- or herself. James Fieser states the altruist dictum as: \"An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent.\" Auguste Comte's version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others. One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an \"altruist.\"\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe word \"altruism\" (French altruisme, from autrui, \"other people\", derived from Latin alter, \"other\") was coined by Auguste Comte, the French founder of positivism, in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a moral obligation to renounce self-interest and live for others. Comte says, in his Cat\u00e9chisme Positiviste, that:\n\n[The] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This [\"to live for others\"], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely.\"\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia says that for Comte's altruism, \"The first principle of morality...is the regulative supremacy of social sympathy over the self-regarding instincts.\" Author Gabriel Moran, (professor in the department of Humanities and the Social Sciences, New York University) says \"The law and duty of life in altruism [for Comte] was summed up in the phrase : Live for others.\"Various philosophers define the doctrine in various ways, but all definitions generally revolve around a moral obligation to benefit others or the pronouncement of moral value in serving others rather than oneself. Philosopher C. D. Broad defines altruism as \"the doctrine that each of us has a special obligation to benefit others.\" Philosopher W. G. Maclagan defines it as \"a duty to relieve the distress and promote the happiness of our fellows...Altruism is to...maintain quite simply that a man may and should discount altogether his own pleasure or happiness as such when he is deciding what course of action to pursue.\"\n\n\n== As consequentialist ethics ==\nAltruism is often seen as a form of consequentialism, as it indicates that an action is ethically right if it brings good consequences to others. Altruism may be seen as similar to utilitarianism, however an essential difference is that the latter prescribes acts that maximize good consequences for all of society, while altruism prescribes maximizing good consequences for everyone except the actor. Spencer argued that since the rest of society will almost always outnumber the utilitarian, a genuine utilitarian will inevitably end up practicing altruism or a form of altruism. Effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that maintains that the consequences of our actions - for ourselves and others - are important, and seeks to maximise the overall quality of these consequences.\n\n\n== Criticisms ==\nDavid Kelley, discussing Ayn Rand's views, says that \"there is no rational ground for asserting that sacrificing yourself in order to serve others is morally superior to pursuing your own (long-term, rational) self-interest. Altruism ultimately depends on non-rational 'rationales,' on mysticism in some form...\" Furthermore, he holds that there is a danger of the state enforcing that moral ideal: \"If self-sacrifice is an ideal - if service to others is the highest, most honorable course of action - why not force people to act accordingly?\" He believes this can ultimately result in the state forcing everyone into a collectivist political system.Norwegian eco-philosopher Arne N\u00e6ss argues that environmental action based upon altruism \u2014 or service of the other \u2014 stems from a shrunken \"egoic\" concept of the self.  Self-actualization will result, he argues, in the recovery of an \"ecological self\", in which actions formerly seen as altruistic are in reality a form of enlightened self-interest.German philosopher Max Scheler distinguishes two different ways in which the strong can help the weak, one which is an expression of love, \"motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one\u2019s own life and existence\" and another which is merely \"one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people\u2019s business.\" At its worst, Scheler says, \"love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nAgape\nEgalitarianism\nEthical egoism\nMett\u0101\nUbuntu\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAyn Rand's quotes on Altruism",

    "Nath \u00cd mac Fiachrach": "Nath \u00cd, also known as Dath\u00ed, son of Fiachrae, son of Eochaid Mugmedon, was a semi-historical Irish king of the 5th century, the father of the likely-historical king Ailill Molt and the ancestor of the U\u00ed Fiachrach dynasties of early medieval Connacht. His mother was B\u00e9\u1e03inn. According to legend, he was a High King of Ireland, and died after being struck by lightning while on an expedition to the Alps.\n\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, Nath \u00cd is primarily known for his descendants. His son Ailill Molt was likely a historical 5th century king. Two more sons, Echu and Fiachnae, were the ancestors of the U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidni and the U\u00ed Fiachrach Muaide respectively, both early medieval dynasties in Connacht.:\u200ap. 298\u200a A fourth son, Amalgaid, was the ancestor of T\u00edrech\u00e1n, the 7th century bishop and biographer of St. Patrick.:\u200ap. 78\u200aNath \u00cd's own status and position are disputed. Most early Irish sources, including the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, the Annals of the Four Masters and Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn, place him in the traditional list of High Kings of Ireland, after Niall of the Nine Hostages and before Niall's son L\u00f3egaire, with Nath \u00cd's son, Ailill Molt, succeeding L\u00f3egaire. However, he is not included in the earliest list of kings of Tara, the Baile Chuinn Ch\u00e9tchathaig. T. F. O'Rahilly argues that Nath \u00cd did not rule at Tara, but was in fact a king of the province of Connacht, although he accepts that Ailill Molt was a king of Tara.:\u200ap. 211\u200a However, Nath \u00cd's name does not appear on the Connacht regnal lists, and Ailill Molt's does.:\u200ap. 232\u200a T. M. Charles-Edwards considers it a possibility that neither were kings of Tara, but that both were included later, when members of the U\u00ed Fiachrach dynasties were prominent and it was felt politically necessary to include their ancestors in the ranks of former High Kings.An early list of Nath \u00cd's battles takes him outside Ireland, including battles in Strathclyde and Kincardine in Scotland, and an expedition across the English Channel to the Alps.:\u200app. 212-213\u200a In the Annals of Ulster there is an entry for the year 445 which originally consisted solely of Nath \u00cd's name. Later writers, presuming this to be his death notice, added the detail that he was struck by lightning in the Alps, circumstances also recounted in the Lebor Gab\u00e1la, Keating and the Annals of the Four Masters, the latter of which dates it to 428. According to legend, his followers carried his body back to Ireland, winning ten battles on the way, and buried him at Cruachan, capital of Connacht.:\u200a212\u2013213\u200a :\u200app. 77-78\u200a   A standing stone said to mark his grave is part of the Rathcroghan complex of archeological sites near Tulsk in County Roscommon.O'Rahilly and Francis J. Byrne observe out that Nath \u00cd's death-tale is modelled on that of Niall of the Nine Hostages,:\u200a213\u2013215\u200a :\u200a78\u200a and as with Niall, the early Irish name for Britain, Alba, may have been confused with Elpa, the Alps. O'Rahilly therefore concludes that \"he was a king of Connacht in the first half of the fifth century, that he appears to have acquired fame in his day as a leader of predatory expeditions to Britain, and that he died in or about the year 445, and was probably buried at Cruachain.\":\u200a214\u2013215\u200a\n\n\n== Legends ==\nThe medieval glossary C\u00f3ir Anmann (\"the fitness of names\") and Keating say his given name was Feradach, and that he was given the nickname dath\u00ed, \"active, quick\" because of his vigour in taking up arms. Keating adds that he had three wives: Fial, daughter of Eochaid; Eithne, daughter of Orach, the mother of Aill Molt; and Ruad, daughter of Airtech Uichtlethan, who died giving birth to another of his sons, Fiachrae Elgach. His other sons were Amalgaid, Echu and Cobthach.According to legend, after the accession of Niall of the Nine Hostages as High King, there was a civil war between Niall's brothers Bri\u00f3n and Fiachrae, Nath \u00cd's father, over the kingship of Connacht. Fiachrae was defeated and captured, but Nath \u00cd continued the war and eventually defeated and killed Bri\u00f3n. Fiachrae was released and became king of Connacht.A fuller version of his death-tale, as mentioned to in the annals, is found in the saga Aided Nath \u00cd (\"the death of Nath \u00cd\"), a later version of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la, and Keating, in which he besieges a tower in which Form\u00e9nus, king of Thrace, lives as a hermit, having forsaken his kingdom for a religious life. Form\u00e9nus prays that God will punish him, and he is struck by lightning, although the Lebor Gab\u00e1la adds that \"scholars suppose\" Form\u00e9nus shot him with an arrow.:\u200a212\u2013213\u200a :\u200app. 77-78\u200a  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBanateanu, V.

    "2021\u201322 North American winter": "The 2021\u201322 North American winter is an ongoing winter season occurring across North America, as happens annually, from late 2021 to early 2022. Based on the astronomical definition, winter began on the winter solstice on December 21, 2021 and will end on the spring equinox on March 20, 2022. Based on the meteorological definition, the first day of winter started on December 1 and the last day will be February 28. These dates historically describe the period in each year when winter storms are most likely to occur. However, winter storms may occur outside of these limits, as shown by the early formation of this season's Mid-October winter storm on October 12. Since both definitions of winter span the start of the calendar year, it is possible to have a winter storm spanning two different years.\n\n\n== Seasonal forecasts ==\n\nOn October 13, 2021, The Weather Channel released its U.S. winter temperature outlooks for the 2021\u201322 winter season. The forecasts reflected the likelihood of a weak La Ni\u00f1a pattern and weak polar vortex during much of the season. Overall for the winter, significantly above-average temperatures were forecast for most of the Southern Tier, with near-average temperatures in the Central and much of the Northeastern United States. Slightly below-average temperatures were expected in most of the north-central and northwestern U.S. During the first half of the season, a relatively weak La Ni\u00f1a was expected to result in widespread below-average temperatures across the northern half of the country, with widespread above-average temperatures in the southern half. However, as both the La Ni\u00f1a and polar vortex were expected to strengthen later in the season, widespread above-average temperatures were forecast in most of the U.S. during the latter half of the winter, especially in the South and East. Below-average temperatures were still expected to continue in the far Northwestern U.S.On October 21, 2021, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center released its U.S. Winter Outlook for the upcoming winter. The temperature and precipitation outlooks reflected a typical La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern during the winter. Significantly above-average temperatures were forecasted across the Southern Tier, especially in the Southeast, with slightly above-average temperatures forecast in the Ohio Valley and Northeast. Near to below-average temperatures were expected in the far northwestern U.S. Below-average precipitation was expected across the far Southern Tier, with particularly in the Southwest, with above-average precipitation forecast in the far Northwestwern U.S., as well as the Ohio Valley and surrounding regions. Near-average precipitation was expected in the Central U.S., Northern Plains, and Northeast. Drought was forecasted to improve and end in the Pacific Northwest, while it was expected to develop or worsen across the Southwest. Drought was not expected in the eastern half of the country.\n\n\n== Seasonal summary ==\n\nThe 2021\u201322 winter season began with the formation of a significant winter storm in the Western United States on October 12, resulting in heavy snow accumulations of up to 28 in (71 cm) across much of the Intermountain West and over 80 rescues due to blizzard-like conditions in Utah. The system was estimated to have caused at least $50 million in damages. After a one-month break in winter weather events due to unfavorable conditions for winter storms, a blizzard began to develop across south-central Canada and the Upper Midwest on November 11.\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Mid-October winter storm ===\nOn October 10 at 03:00 UTC, an extratropical cyclone made landfall near Vancouver. This cyclone's remnants became a weak, elongated frontal system over the interior West Coast by October 11 at 12:00 UTC. After remaining disorganized for about 12 hours, the system began to coalesce into a stronger extratropical cyclone over Colorado on October 12. It also began to drop snow over parts of the Rocky Mountains by this point. The system then merged into a well-formed extratropical cyclone with a single-low pressure center by early the next day, beginning to steadily intensify. Snowfall rates began to rapidly increase in bands to the west of the center throughout the day, with up to a foot of snow falling within hours. The system reached its peak intensity of 988 mbar (29.2 inHg) at 21:00 UTC on October 13. The extratropical cyclone then began to accelerate to the north, becoming occluded in the process. The weakening system then moved into the Canadian Prairies, resulting in some more snow there, before merging into another frontal system on October 15.The precursor to the system resulted in blizzard conditions across parts of northeastern Utah on October 11, disrupting a 50-mile ultramarathon occurring there. Extremely heavy snowfall rates and winds gusting to tropical storm-force resulted in the race being called off, and over 87 rescues had to be made in the snow. The next day, up to 6 inches (15 cm) of snow fell across mountainous areas of Colorado as the system was organizing. The system also resulted in wind gusts of over 64 mph (103 km/h) in parts of Nevada that day. On October 13, the system moved north into areas such as Wyoming, with 17.4 inches (44 cm) of snow falling in Casper, and even higher totals in the high elevations. Additionally, hurricane-force wind gusts were recorded across parts of eastern Colorado and western South Dakota, with a 74 mph (119 km/h) gust occurring in Wasta. As the storm system reached peak intensity on October 14, heavy snowfall rates resulted in snowfall totals of over 2 feet (0.61 m) in parts of eastern Montana, with the storm's maximum snowfall total of 28 inches (71 cm) occurring in Pony. Larger cities such as Billings and Bozeman also saw 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm) of snow from the system. Areas in the Black Hills such as Deadwood and Whitewood measured over 24 inches (61 cm) of snow, with Rapid City also recording 3 inches (7.6 cm). As the system moved into south-central Canada later that day, it also resulted in some light snowfall there before the system dissipated the next day. According to Aon Benfield, the system was estimated to have caused at least $50 million (2021 USD) in damages.\n\n\n=== Late October West Coast bomb cyclone ===\n\nIn late October 2021, a powerful bomb cyclone struck the Western United States and Western Canada, bringing severe impacts to the region.\n\n\n=== Mid-November blizzard ===\nAt 15:00 UTC on November 10, an area of low pressure formed over central Kansas, this area moved northeastward over the Great Plains as it deepened, Blizzard Warnings were issued in advance of the storm in Minnesota and South Dakota, with High Wind warnings also being issued. The storm moved erratically as it looped oved the arrowhead of Minnesota on November 11\u201312 before being absorbed the next day over Lake Superior. The storm brought 5 inches of snow to Winnipeg by November 12, with the highest snowfall in Manitoba for that storm recorded in Pinawa at 12 inches.While the storm was moving over the Upper Midwest, Storm warnings and Gale warnings were issued for portions of the Great Lakes, waves from Lake Superior caused lakeshore flooding in Grand Marais.\n\n\n=== Mid-December storm complex ===\n\nIn mid-December, a large storm complex produced a devastating tornado outbreak in the South. On the wintry side, a prolific snowstorm occurred within the Plains and Upper Midwest,  entering the Western United States on December 9. The storm brought the first measurable snowfall of the rainy season to Utah. In southern Wyoming and Colorado, the storm dropped a maximum total of 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow in the mountains.In Minnesota, some towns and cities received over one foot (30 cm) of snow. The Twin Cities received a maximum total of 21 inches (53 cm) of snow, making the winter storm the heaviest snowstorm recorded in the area since another blizzard in April 2018. Minneapolis and St. Paul each declared snow emergencies. In the Twin Cities, Metro Transit reported that half of its busses were delayed. More than 250 flights were canceled at Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport. Near Faribault, a seven-car pileup occurred on Interstate 35. Minnesota State Patrol reported 232 crashes, causing 19 injuries. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for part of Minnesota during the December 10.\n\n\n=== Late December\u2013early January West Coast winter storms ===\nA series of winter storms in late December and early January brought a cold snap and heavy snowfall to parts of the West Coast, particularly areas in the Pacific Northwest region. Several weather stations in Washington state recorded record-breaking low temperatures for December 26 and 27, with temperatures at 17 \u00b0F (\u22128 \u00b0C) in Seattle and 7 \u00b0F (\u221214 \u00b0C) in Bellingham. Seattle recorded 9.2 inches (23 cm) of snow in December, exceeding the city's normal winter average, while some parts of the region had more than 1 foot (0.30 m). The storm also disrupted travel within the region, causing bus routes to be cancelled and flights at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport to be delayed or cancelled.The Cascade Range saw substantial snowfall, with Snoqualmie Pass reporting a seasonal total of 236 inches (600 cm), breaking a 20-year record. In the Sierra Nevadas of California, snowfall of up to 126.9 inches (322 cm) was reported at some ski areas.Another storm on January 6 led to the closure of several mountain passes in the Cascade Range, leaving only one east\u2013west route across Washington. Snoqualmie Pass reopened to limited traffic four days later. Interstate 5, the main north\u2013south highway in Western Washington, also closed in Lewis County due to flooding from torrential rains.\n\n\n=== Early January winter storm ===\n\nA winter storm exited the east coast of the United States on January 4, producing snowfall from Alabama to New England, with as much as 6.0 inches accumulating in Huntsville, Alabama and 6.9 inches falling at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. A peak snowfall accumulation of 15.5 in (390 mm) was recorded in Huntingtown, Maryland. Many vehicles and motorists across Interstate 95 in Virginia were stranded due to the snow, with some of them for 24 hours. Over 1,000 motor crashes were also reported and assisted by the state's police. It also caused 3 people to die in a car crash in Maryland. Thousands of flights were canceled in the eastern United States. This storm came after a day of record high temperatures; the temperature in Huntsville, Alabama the day before the storm was 79\u00b0degrees, a record for January. The winter storm was unofficially named Winter Storm Frida by The Weather Channel. It also caused 343,000 power outages in Virginia, 43,000 in North Carolina and 42,000 in Maryland.  North-central, northeast and northwest portions of Georgia were placed under winter storm warnings by the National Weather Service there on 1 January. Mccaysville registered an unnoficial snow accumulation of 4.5 inches (11 cm), followed by Blue Ridge at 4.0 inches (10 cm). Some of the areas of the state also saw power outages. Winter alerts were also placed over some areas of the state. Over 59,000 household customers lost electricity across Charlotte City, with 159,000 overall over the Carolinas. Some establishments were completely wrecked by the strong winds the storm brought, and trees were reported to have been downed. This further rose to 211,000 by 3 January and lessened to 2,500 as rescue teams started working to restore electricity.Farther north, in Iceland, news about the storm were dispatched across the country's people as a preparation. The south and western parts of Iceland were also placed under an orange warning by the Icelandic Meteorological Office by 5 January. The Icelandic Coast Guard also alerted vessels and fishermen in ports regarding the brunt of it. Icelandair also canceled some flight operations by that day owing to the storm. In the southwest portion of the country, rescue teams were reported to have been responding to the calls by the citizens there regarding the impact of the storm. Across Reykjav\u00edk, they responded to flying roofs of different houses and establishments. Su\u00f0urnes (Southern Peninsula) and Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) were also severely affected. A hut was also blown away by strong winds in Vatnsleysustr\u00f6nd. The country's eastern portion meanwhile, was battered by rough waves from the storm. Harbours at Hafnarh\u00f3lmur sustained \"biggest\" damages, as well as some vessels docked there. Rocks from the shores also pushed over the area's roadways; this was cleaned up subsequently.\n\n\n=== Early January nor'easter ===\nA winter storm, unofficially named Winter Storm Garrett by The Weather Channel impacted the Ohio Valley and Northeastern United States starting on January 6. The storm dropped nearly ten inches of snow on Lexington, Kentucky, causing 250 car crashes causing 18 injuries. The storm also dropped 6+ inches of snow on the eastern New York metropolitan area, with the city center receiving 5.8 inches (15 cm). Parts of Connecticut saw over a foot of snow and of Long Island saw up to 9.3 inches (240 mm) of snow.  Meanwhile, parts of the Philadelphia metro area saw 3\u20135 inches (7.6\u201312.7 cm) of snow. Meanwhile, further north, parts of southeastern Massachusetts got hit with up to 13 inches (330 mm) of snow, with the city of Boston itself seeing 11.7 inches (300 mm).\n\n\n=== January cold wave ===\n\n\n=== Mid-January winter storm ===\n\nA weak area of low pressure developed on January 13 in southwestern Canada, moving southeastwards into the High Plains while delivering heavy snowfall and began moving more southwards through the states of Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri into the early morning hours of January 14. Later that day, at 21:00 UTC the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) began issuing periodic storm summary bulletins on the developing system, albeit with competing areas of low pressure. Moving further south, a stronger low began forming over southern Missouri on January 15, moving into Arkansas and began strengthening due to a strong upper-level low located nearby. Associated cold air in place over the aforementioned areas allowed snow to break out in areas further south, as the system began occluding later that night while wintry precipitation spread eastward towards the Southeastern United States into the early morning hours of January 16. The system began turning more northward later that day into the southern Appalachian Mountains as the two centers began merging.The storm, unofficially named Winter Storm Izzy by The Weather Channel, caused 11 inches (28 cm) of snow in Laurens, Iowa. There were also 78 car crashes reported, which caused 14 injures. Georgia, Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina all declared a state of emergency in preparation for the winter storm.\n\n\n=== Other systems ===\n\n\n==== Late October nor'easter ====\n\nA strong nor'easter in late October brought high winds, cutting power to more than 600,000 people in New England.

    "Bohemian Quartet": "The Bohemian Quartet (Czech: '\u010cesk\u00e9 kvarteto'; known as the Czech Quartet after 1918) was a Czech string quartet of international repute that was founded in 1891 and disbanded in 1934.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe Quartet was founded in Prague by three pupils of Anton\u00edn Bennewitz (Karel Hoffmann, Josef Suk and Oskar Nedbal) and a pupil of Hanu\u0161 Wihan (Otakar Berger); Bennewitz and Wihan were both teachers at the Prague Conservatory. Wihan had himself studied at Prague, and was cellist of the chamber quartet of Ludwig II in Munich, becoming Professor at Prague in 1888. He replaced his student Otakar Berger as cellist in the quartet when Berger died prematurely. Wihan then directed the Quartet until 1913 when the strain of touring obliged him to retire from it and resume his teaching. His place was then taken by Ladislav Zelenka (b. 1881), who since 1911 had been playing with the \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk-Lhotsk\u00fd Quartet. In 1906, the violist Nedbal had run off with Hoffmann's wife; during the tour in England, his place was at short notice taken by Lionel Tertis and afterwards formally by Je\u0159\u00ed Herold. The group made repeated tours in Europe, especially with the quartets of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Smetana, and were noted for their warm tone and fiery rhythms. In 1922 the four members were appointed professors at the Prague Conservatory.\nMany key contemporary works were written for and/or first performed by the Bohemian Quartet. Most notably, this included works by Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek, such as Jan\u00e1\u010dek's second string quartet, subtitled \"Intimate Letters\".\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n1st violin\n\nKarel Hoffmann2nd violin\n\nJosef Suk (to 1933)\nStanislav Nov\u00e1k (1933\u201334)viola\n\nOskar Nedbal (to 1906)\nJi\u0159\u00ed Herold (1906\u20131934)violoncello\n\nOtto Berger (to 1894)\nHanu\u0161 Wihan (1894\u20131914)\nLadislav Zelenka (1914\u20131934)\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nSmetana: Quartet no. 1 in E minor (1876) (Polydor 78rpm, 95076-95079).

    "Portrait of Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara": "Portrait of Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara is a 1600 painting of cardinal Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara by El Greco, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\nIn the article, \u201cThree Paintings by El Greco,\u201d Walter Liedtke theorizes that it was the nephew of Cardinal Guevara, Pedro Lasso, who commissioned his portrait. In Spain during this time it was a novelty to commission a portrait on one's self (outside of courtiers), therefore it is most likely a family member who commissioned this portrait.  Conde de Los Arcos (Pedro Lasso), was an established patron of El Greco at the time when this portrait was commissioned. Lasso was a prominent member of the Spanish court and one of the only titled noble members among El Greco's group of friends and acquaintances.  At the time of Lasso's death, he is said to have owned seven or eight El Greco paintings, although it is unclear whether the portrait of Cardinal Fernando Nino de Guevara was among this group.\nThe commission of this painting likely occurred in the spring of 1600, when the Cardinal visiting Toledo for several weeks. As Katharine Baetjer notes, Guevara was named cardinal of San Martino ai Monti in 1596 and thereafter traveled to Rome. In 1599, the Cardinal then received a nomination and subsequent promotion to Inquisitor General of Spain, and made a trip to Toledo. It is possible that, during the Cardinal's visit to Toledo, Conde de Los Arcos may have recommended El Greco to his uncle. Although Guevara had siblings who could have commissioned his portrait, during this time, his sister's were dedicated to various convents and his brother, Rodrigo, lived primarily in the Spanish Netherlands and was likely not in Spain often enough to know the prominence and popularity of the work of El Greco.\nThis portrait may have served as a celebration of family pride. Liedtke also notes that, \u201camong the many works of art that Pedro Lasso collected and commissioned were family portraits and portraits of public figures, including famous churchmen and Spanish royalty.\u201d Pedro Lasso may have used this commissions portrait of his uncle as a \u2018public gesture,\u2019 and placed it in a \u201cresidence, family chapel, or an institution such as a church that he was known to support.\u201d If this portrait was hung in a public space, it would serve two purposes which elevated the family's status, having a prominent member of the church as a relative, and having a well-known artist (who by this time has received at least one commission for King Philip II) paint the portrait.\nThe painting of the novel was fictionalised in the 1936 novel El Greco malt den Gro\u00dfinquisitor by Stefan Andres.\nIn the 1947 film Lady in Ermine, the inquisitor (Rafael Calvo) sits for his portrait and judges a trial involving a Jewish silversmith in love with El Greco's (fictional) daughter.\nThe 2007 film El Greco (directed by Yannis Smaragdis) includes a fictional incident of the cardinal (played by Juan Diego Botto)  trying El Greco before the Inquisition.\n\n\n== References ==",
    "\u0218tefan R\u0103zvan": "\u0218tefan R\u0103zvan (died December 1595) was a Voivode (Prince) of Moldavia (between 24 April 1595 and August 1595) of Romani descent from the historical state of Wallachia.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nThe father of \u0218tefan R\u0103zvan was a Muslim Roma from the Ottoman Empire who emigrated north of Danube, in Wallachia, while his mother was a Romanian peasant from the new country of settlement. At that time, all the Romani people living in the Romanian states of Wallachia and Moldavia were slaves. The rule was applied also to any Romani immigrants, excepting the Ottoman citizens. Benefiting of this exception, the father and later the son could remain free and become an active part in the local society.\n\u0218tefan R\u0103zvan appears as a political player at the beginning of Michael the Brave's rule in Wallachia (1593\u20131601), as a close noble ally of the Wallachian Prince. He previously converted from Islam to Christianity, attracting the wrath of the Ottomans. He had the boyar social status and he was a cultured person. Later, he becomes involved in the politics of the neighbouring Romanian country of Moldavia, where he was appointed as part of the Princiary council, with the title of  hatman (second in rank in the army after the Prince), during the reign of Aaron the Tyrant. He led the campaigns of the Moldavian army against Tighina, Chilia, Cetatea Alb\u0103 and Northern Dobruja, then occupied by the Ottomans. \u0218tefan became very popular among the soldiers and, with their support and with the help of the Transylvanian Prince Sigismund B\u00e1thory, he ousted Aaron the Tyrant (whose image was eroded among the population), on 24 April 1595.\nHis leadership did not last long, because the neighboring political power, the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth did not agree with \u0218tefan R\u0103zvan's alliance with Transylvania and Wallachia. They invaded Moldavia in August, bringing Ieremia Movil\u0103 as the Prince accepted by the Poles. The decisive battle was on the Suceava's plains (on 3 December 1595), concluded, after three hours of fight, with the Polish victory. \u0218tefan fled towards Transylvania, but he was captured and impaled.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nIstoria \u0219i tradi\u021biile minorit\u0103\u021bii rromani, p. 28, 2005, Sigma, Bucharest, Delia Grigore, Petre Petcu\u021b and Mariana Sandu\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to \u0218tefan VIII R\u0103zvan at Wikimedia Commons",

She grew up in the Chiswick area of London. She was named after Allegra Byron, a daughter of the poet Lord Byron. She attended Chiswick Community School and Latymer Upper School, an independent school in the Hammersmith district of London, before studying archaeology and anthropology at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Journalism ===\nStratton worked as a producer for the BBC, on the foreign desk at The Times, and wrote for The Independent and the New Statesman. She then joined The Guardian as a political correspondent, presenting the newspaper's Politics Weekly podcast with journalist Tom Clark.In 2006, Stratton published a non-fiction book, Muhajababes, that explored the youth culture of the Middle East and the contradictions of the modern life of young adults in Muslim societies. The book was based on Stratton's experiences of travelling in the region in 2005.Stratton returned to the BBC on 20 February 2012, as political editor of Newsnight, replacing Michael Crick who left to become a political correspondent for Channel 4. In May the same year, she faced criticism for a Newsnight interview with a single mother who was claiming housing benefit. The interviewee described feeling \"humiliated\" by Stratton, who misrepresented her as unemployed. Private Eye magazine reported that Stratton had chosen the single mother over several other interviewees offered, including a couple with four children who had lost their jobs and faced homelessness. This incident led to a 20,000-signature petition soliciting an apology from Stratton and Newsnight. Following an official complaint to the BBC's Editorial Complaints Unit, a correction and apology was issued by Peter Rippon, the editor of Newsnight, in August.In November 2015, the BBC announced that Stratton was leaving to join ITV News as its national editor. She made her first appearance on ITV's News at Ten in January 2016 and co-presented Peston on Sunday with Robert Peston until April 2018, when she departed to spend weekends with her children.\n\n\n=== Government communications ===\nStratton left ITV News in April 2020 to become Director of Strategic Communications at the Treasury under Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Six months later, in October 2020, she was given the newly created role of Downing Street press secretary, to present proposed televised press briefings initially scheduled for launch in November 2020. The briefings were subsequently delayed to January 2021 and it was reported that they would take place when the House of Commons was sitting on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. The January launch date was repeatedly pushed back due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and on 20 April it was announced that the briefings would be scrapped entirely, with Stratton instead becoming the spokesperson for the COP26 summit that was held in Glasgow in November 2021. In this role, she made comments that a diesel car suited her lifestyle better than an electric car, that rinsing plates before putting them in the dishwasher would help the environment, and that the public should join the Green Party in order to combat the climate crisis. During the conference The Guardian reported she \"stayed in the background\" and had \"an unclear role\".\n\n\n==== 2020 Downing Street Christmas party controversy ====\n\nOn 7 December 2021, ITV News released a video of a mock press conference from 22 December 2020, in which Stratton and other Downing Street staff made joking references to a Christmas gathering at 10 Downing Street that took place four days earlier. In the leaked 47-second clip, filmed from the Downing Street Press Briefing Room, Stratton and the other staff joked about the \"fictional party\" being just \"cheese and wine\" and a \"business meeting\" with \"no social distancing\". BBC News reported that the event had \"several dozen\" attendees and that \"party games were played, food and drink were served, and the party went on past midnight\". At the time of the alleged party, London was under COVID-19 tier 3 lockdown restrictions. The restrictions prohibited indoor gatherings of more than six people, with exceptions for certain work-related activities.The day after the ITV story was broadcast, Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised for the video during Prime Minister's Questions, describing himself as \"furious\" about it, but continued to deny that a party had taken place and declared that an investigation would be undertaken by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case. Three hours later, Stratton resigned from her position as government spokesperson for the COP26 summit and apologised for her remarks which she asserted she would regret \"for the rest of [her] days\". On 15 December, a picture was leaked showing Johnson taking part in a Christmas quiz at 10 Downing Street around the same time that the parties happened in 2020; the quiz was virtual and happened online, but the picture showed Johnson sitting in a room with at least two other people.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nStratton is married to James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator magazine. They have two children and live in the Canonbury area of London. Future Chancellor Rishi Sunak was best man at their wedding in 2011, and they and Sunak are godparents to each other's children.In November 2020, Stratton told The Sunday Telegraph that she had voted for the Labour Party, the Green Party, and the Liberal Democrats in the past, but later supported Brexit and described herself as \"a Johnson Tory\". She is said to be an ally and friend of Johnson's wife Carrie.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nStratton, Allegra (2006). Muhajababes (first ed.). London: Constable.

    "Preston Barracks": "Preston Barracks was a military installation in Lewes Road, Preston, Brighton. The buildings and site are being converted into student residences and a business school.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe barracks were built in the regency style as part of the British response to the threat of the French Revolution and were completed in 1793. The barracks were designed to accommodate artillery and cavalry units and included stables for up to 1,000 horses. The structures included a building originally built as a canteen but which was converted into a military hospital in 1820: it went on to be used as a location for various military meetings, including courts-martial, chaired by Lieutenant-Colonel the Earl of Cardigan, who commanded the 11th Light Dragoons at the barracks in the 1840s and who then commanded the light brigade at the Battle of Balaklava during the Crimean War. This structure later became known as the Crimean War Building.Married quarters were added in the 1850s and a new officers' mess was built in around 1900. The original regency barracks, at the southern end of the site, were largely demolished in 1990 and that part of the site is now occupied by the Pavilion Retail Park.The northern end of the site was used as a Territorial Army Centre until around 2000; it is now however largely derelict. However, the Crimean War Building survives and remains in Ministry of Defence ownership for use as an Army Cadet Force Centre. The officers' mess is also still standing but is empty.\n\nThe northern end of the site was acquired by Brighton and Hove City Council in 2002: there are plans to develop this part of the site for the University of Brighton\u2019s Business School.The university's vice chancellor, Debra Humphris, advocated for a \u00a3300m transformation of the barracks into student residences and the university's business school.\n\n\n== References ==",

Forbes ranks Hairy Dawg No. 3 in their list of \"America's Top 10 Sports Mascots\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first costumed bulldog at the University of Georgia was a gray anthropomorphic dog called \"Fluffie,\" who was designed \"[to capture] the hearts of children with his cuddly features and tumbling stunts.\" Fluffie was created in 1975 by the late Coach Mike Castronis.The inspiration for Hairy Dawg came during the 1980 football season at the Florida vs. Georgia Football Classic, when Florida unveiled its new, more intimidating mascot. Compared to the rival's mascot, Georgia\u2019s mascot at that time, Fluffie, was described as a \"dark, dingy gray mutt with zero personality.\" Tom Sapp, a 1969 Georgia graduate and designer of the mascot explains, \u201cI created Hairy Dawg to intimidate.\" Hairy's name derives from the popular Georgia cheer, \"Go You Hairy Dogs!\" Former University head football coach Vince Dooley was the first to be presented with the sketches for Hairy Dawg and wanted the mascot at the 1981 Sugar Bowl. After many long and stressful hours of sweating and stitching by Sapp, Hairy Dawg was ready in three weeks for the national championship game between the Georgia Bulldogs and Notre Dame Fighting Irish. UGA student cheerleader, Stan Beecham, was the first to dress out as Hairy Dawg when the Bulldogs went on to beat the Irish and were crowned national champions.Hairy Dawg's first appearance in Sanford Stadium was not until the Georgia Bulldogs' 1981 home opener, a 44-0 shut-out of the Tennessee Volunteers.\n\n\n== Media appearances ==\nHairy Dawg is one of the most recognizable mascots in the country and makes regular appearances in the national media.

    "2MASS J04070752+1546457": "2MASS J04070752+1546457 (abbreviated to 2MASS J0407+1546) is a rapidly-rotating brown dwarf of spectral class L3.5, located in the constellation Taurus about 119 light-years from Earth. With a photometrically measured rotation period of 1.23 hours, it is one of the fastest-rotating known brown dwarfs announced by a team of astronomers led by Megan E. Tannock in March 2021. With a rotational velocity of over 80 km/s (50 mi/s), it is approaching the predicted rotational speed limit beyond which it would break apart due to centripetal forces. As a consequence of its rapid rotation, the brown dwarf is slightly flattened at its poles to a similar degree as Saturn, the most oblate planet in the Solar System. Its rapid rotation may enable strong auroral radio emissions via particle interactions in its magnetic field, as observed in other known rapidly-rotating brown dwarfs.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\n2MASS J0407+1546 was first catalogued as a point source in June 2003 by the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) organized by the University of Massachusetts Amherst\nand the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center under the California Institute of Technology. It was discovered to be a brown dwarf of the spectral class L3.5 by I. Neill Reid and collaborators, based on near-infrared spectra obtained in October 2005 with the Gemini North at the Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii. Their discovery and spectroscopic characterization of 430 ultracool dwarfs including 2MASS J0407+1546 was published in The Astronomical Journal in September 2008.\n\n\n== Distance ==\nThe trigonometric parallax of 2MASS 1114\u22122618 was measured to be 27.4408\u00b11.7735 milliarcseconds by the Gaia spacecraft in 2018, corresponding to a distance of 36.4 \u00b1 2.4 parsecs (118.7 \u00b1 7.8 ly). This is in close agreement with Reid et al.'s spectrophotometric estimate of 33.1 \u00b1 3.3 parsecs (108 \u00b1 11 ly) in 2008, calculated from the object's spectral type and near-infrared absolute magnitude.\n\n\n== Proper motion ==\nFrom Gaia DR2, 2MASS J0407+1546 has a measured net proper motion of 81.0 mas/yr with position angle 139.06 degrees, indicating motion in south-east direction on the sky.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2MASS J12195156+3128497 \u2013 L8 spectral class brown dwarf with a period of 1.14+0.03\u22120.01 h\n2MASS J03480772\u22126022270 \u2013 T7 spectral class brown dwarf with a period of 1.080+0.004\u22120.005 h\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrio of Fast-Spinning Brown Dwarfs May Reveal a Rotational Speed Limit, Calla Cofield, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 7 April 2021\nWestern space scientists identify fastest-spinning \"failed stars\" ever found, Jeff Renaud, University of Western Ontario, 7 April 2021\nCaught Speeding: Clocking the Fastest-Spinning Brown Dwarfs, NOIRLab, 7 April 2021",

    "Loch Errochty": "Loch Errochty is a man made freshwater loch situated within the Perth and Kinross council area at the edge of the Scottish Highlands near the Highland Boundary Fault where the topography changes to lowland.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Errochty dam lies at the head of Glen Errochty, two km NW of the hamlet of Trinafour at the approximate grid reference of NN689654. The loch has an area of 303 hectares and is 5 km long and a kilometre across at its widest point. The loch is entirely man made, being created by the damming of the Errochty Water, the river which runs down the glen. The dam was constructed in 1957 by the contractors A. & M. Carmichael Ltd as part of phase two of the Tummel hydro-electric power scheme. The loch stands at 330 metres above sea level. The dam itself is an example of a diamond-headed buttress dam, it is 49 metres high and 354 metres across. The diamond-headed buttresses provide extra strength to deal with possible tremors from the Highland Boundary Fault which runs just to the south of Pitlochry. Water from Loch Errochty is diverted through a 10 km long tunnel to the Errochty hydroelectricity power station at the western end of Loch Tummel.  The gatehouse for the tunnel at Loch Errochty is near the southern shore, the actual intake is beneath it at the bottom of the loch.  The power station has a maximum output of 75 MW and is the largest power producer of the nine main stations in the Tummel scheme.  Water is released from the dam to compensate the flow of the Errochty Water, this compensation water flows down a pipeline for 1.5 km to the very small 500 kW hydro power station at Trinafour before being released into the Errochty Water.\n\n\n== Water supply to the loch ==\nLoch Errochty's main feeder streams are the Allt Sl\u00e9ibh and the Allt Ruighe nan Saorach which both rise in the high ground to the west of the head of the loch. Other small streams flow directly off the 892-metre-high (2,927 ft) mountain of Beinn a' Chuallaich which stands just to the south. Supplementary water is diverted into the loch from the east by the Errochty catchwater, a system of tunnels and surface pipelines at a height of approximately 380 metres which redirects water from five small tributary streams of the River Garry, and the Garry itself. The catchwater then goes through a tunnel in the hill which separates the Garry and Errochty valleys to join the loch. This method of re-directing water allows it to be used more often to generate electricity. Some of the water within the Tummel scheme passes through five of the power stations and thus generates electricity five times.\n\n\n== Access and fishing ==\nThe north shore of the loch has a narrow surfaced road which is not open to general traffic, there being a locked gate at Trinafour to prevent access. The south side of the loch has extensive woodlands in the area around the dam wall. A track goes through the woodland from Trinafour and then continues in open country along the south shore until it reaches the ruin of Ruighe nan Saorach. Recreational fishing is popular on the loch with some large specimens of Pike and Perch being present. There are no salmon in the loch as a fish ladder has not been provided to allow the passage of migrating fish past the dam. Permits to fish are required from the Auchleeks estate.\n\n\n== Old buildings ==\nThe southern shore of the loch has numerous remains of old buildings. This is believed to be the remnants of old sheep farms which were in the valley before it was flooded. The remains include old farmsteads, shielings and sheep pens, some with walls 30 cm (12 ins) high. Many more of the remains are now believed to be under water.\n\n\n== References ==",

From 1909 to 1915 he lived in Villahermosa, then known as San Juan Bautista de la Villa Hermosa, studying at the Instituto Ju\u00e1rez while also agitating through revolutionary circles. In 1913 Bartlett helped found and became President of the Ju\u00e1rez Institute's Free Student Association, but ended up being expelled from the school after leading a protest against Huerta's assassination of President Madero. While at the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico he worked as editor of the student newspaper El Estudiante, graduating with a degree in law in 1920.\nBartlett returned to Villahermosa that same year and taught for a brief time at his old school, the Instituto Ju\u00e1rez. He also served as syndic in the Ayuntamiento del Centro (City Council) and President of the Committee of Public Health. From 1921-22 he served as a deputy to the Congress of the State of Tabasco. From 1920 to 1929 he held various legal and governmental positions, including consulting lawyer to the City Council of Mexico City (1920); public defender to the military (1922); consulting lawyer to the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (1924\u201328); and chief of the legal department of the same (1929). After a decade working in different district-judicial capacities Bartlett was made a Justice of the Mexican Supreme Court, position which he would hold from 1941 to 1951.\nIn 1953, after three previously unsuccessful attempts, Bartlett obtained the PRI's nomination for the governorship of Tabasco, a decision which, owing to the party's virtual monopoly on power, all but assured him the office. However, as a result of intra-party struggles combined with civil unrest in the state, Bartlett fell out of favor with the Adolfo Ruiz Cortines administration and was pressured to leave the post before the conclusion of his term. On March 22, 1955, Bartlett asked for and was granted a leave of absence by the State Congress, effectively ending his governorship.\nBartlett was married to Isabel D\u00edaz Castilla, niece of famed poet and insurgent Salvador D\u00edaz Mir\u00f3n. His son Manuel Bartlett D\u00edaz is a high PRI official and former governor of Puebla. Manuel Bartlett Bautista died on April 24, 1963 and is buried in Mexico City.\n\n\n== Published works ==\n(list not comprehensive)\n\nLa defensa como procuraci\u00f3n. 1920\nEl pocho, cojoes, tigres y pochoveras: interesantes y curiosas costumbres tradicionales de Tenosique, Tab. 1926\nLa cuesti\u00f3n electoral tabasque\u00f1a (1923-1926). 1954\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n(English) Camp, Roderic Ai, Mexican political biographies, 1935-1993.

    "Cove lighting": "Cove lighting is a form of indirect lighting built into ledges, recesses, or valances in a ceiling or high on the walls of a room. It directs light up towards the ceiling and down adjacent walls. It may be used as primary lighting, or for aesthetic accent, especially to highlight decorative ceilings. Cove lighting is valued because it hides the fixtures, and because it provides a very even light.\n\n\n== Types of cove lights ==\nOne method of installing cove lighting is by using T5 fluorescent tubes. T5 luminaires are an energy-efficient alternative to larger luminaires (such as T8 lamps) because they save on materials. An even better energy-efficient alternative is to use LED strips, mounted on an aluminium profiles for optimum heat dissipation, with prismatic covers. With a dimming controller (either analog 1..10V controls or digital, DALI based), the cove lighting can be dimmed. A wide range of LEDs are available, from warm white, daylight and even colour changing RGB modules.\n\n\n== Installation ==\nLighting specialists recommend installing cove lighting at least 18 inches (46 cm) from the ceiling and 6 feet 8 inches (2.03 m) from the floor. In kitchens, cove lights can be installed on the top of kitchen cabinets. Luminaire strips should overlap the tubes to reduce the shadow effect at the lamp ends.\n\n\n== References ==",

He is the founder of the Laugh Factory, a chain of comedy clubs in several states.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nMasada is a Persian Jewish immigrant from Iran who had arrived in America as a teenager. Despite the fact that he was living in a garage and barely spoke English, he combined Persian and Hebrew and soon was working with professional comedians like Richard Pryor, Jay Leno, David Letterman and Redd Foxx.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Laugh Factory ===\nIn 1979, Masada used a loan from Neal Israel to open the Laugh Factory on Sunset Boulevard. While other comedy club owners in Los Angeles were not paying the comedians, his goal was to create a venue where comedians could perform and earn money by \"splitting the door\".\n\n\n=== The Laugh Factory Presents ===\nThe Laugh Factory Presents is an online stand-up comedy series, which Masada created for up-and-coming comedians to spread their material to a wider audience via YouTube and Amazon.com. Masada's plan is to film comedians' shows on the Laugh Factory stage and allow them to keep 80% of the profits made from the specials. With the help of Laugh Factory New Media, Masada produced two The Laugh Factory Presents specials, The Laugh Factory Presents Tim Gaither Live from Las Vegas and The Laugh Factory Presents Raj Sharma Live from Las Vegas.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nIn recognition of all his hard work, Masada is the recipient of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the ACLU Freedom of Speech Award and the NAACP Freedom Award. In 2011, Masada received an award from Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services for being a Comedy Innovator and Humanitarian and for offering comics a listening ear to deal with their personal demons.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\n\nIn an effort to support under-privileged children, Masada created the Laugh Factory's Comedy Camp for children in 1985. Through this camp, he has worked with over a thousand children, using comedy as a way to build their self confidence.Since 1979, Masada has hosted free Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners at The Laugh Factory for the homeless, the poor, or anyone who doesn't want to be alone for the holidays, with over 5000 attending in 2008.The Laugh Factory also hosts free services during the High Holy Days of Judaism.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Laugh Factory owner is serious about comedy\".

    "Linked Data Notifications": "Linked Data Notifications (LDN)  is a W3C Recommendation that describes a communications protocol based on HTTP, URI, and RDF on how servers (receivers) can receive messages pushed to them by applications (senders), as well as how other applications (consumers) may retrieve those messages. Any web resource (like a HTML page) can advertise a receiving endpoint (inbox) for notification messages. Messages are expressed in RDF, and can contain arbitrary data.\n\n\n== Motivation ==\nThe web is a decentralized system of web resources, published by multiple organizations and individuals. Web resources, such as web pages and more formally structured Linked Data, frequently include links to other resources across the web, and may comment or describe them in various ways. The receiving end, however, are not generally notified of such link creation, and thus are unable to provide backlinks without manual intervention. Interactions within social media platforms, such as comments on a news article, are currently \"locked\" within the platform and hard to access across the web.\nSeveral linkback mechanisms exists, and are commonly used between blog systems, e.g. a \"response\" post in blog B about a post in blog A causes B's platform to send a pingback to be shown on the original blog A. These mechanisms are however generally limited in which structured information can be sent, and the notifications themselves do not form part of the decentralized web and may be difficult to consume by any third party application.\nA key motivation for LDN is to support notifications between decentralized Web applications, including web browsers who - not having their own HTTP server - are unable to generate a HTTP link for their reply messages. Another motivation is to structure  notifications as RDF statements using any Controlled vocabulary - so that any consuming application can select the particular information they understand.\n\n\n== Protocol ==\nA sender or receiver performs a GET or HEAD to an existing HTTP resource. Its inbox URI is discovered from either:\nA Link: relation in the HTTP response headers of type http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox\nAn RDF statement embedded in the HTTP body using the RDF property http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#inbox\nA sender creates a new notification (e.g. as JSON-LD), which it POSTs to the inbox URI.\nThe receiver creates a new HTTP resource containing the posted notification and responds with 201 Created and the created URI.\nA consumer retrieves RDF from the discovered inbox URI using GET, then:\nThe consumer parses the response body to find RDF statements with the property http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#contains. The object of these statements give the URIs to the accepted LDN notifications.\nThe consumer retrieve any of the linked notification using GET and process their RDF in an application-specific manner.\nNotifications remain accessible, and can therefore be linked to and described in other web resources.At each stage, the sender and consumer may perform content negotiation to send or receive in any mutually agreed RDF serialization format, however a compliant LDN receiver must support at least JSON-LD.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nA sender or consumer discovers the inbox for a given URI, in this example using the HEAD method:\n\nA sender sends a notification to the discovered inbox, in this example using the Schema.org vocabulary:\n\nA consumer lists the content of the discovered inbox to find 3 notifications:\n\nNote that the URIs of the original resource, inbox and notifications are not required to be hosted on the same HTTP server (e.g. they may be on a CDN). The consumer follows the links for any notifications they wish to retrieve.\nIn this example, the consumer retrieves the new f44f3f11 notification, with content negotiation to prefer the Turtle RDF format:\n\n\n== Implementations ==\nSeveral LDN implementations exists, covering senders, consumers and receivers, including:\n\ndokieli (sender, consumer)\nerrol (sender)\nFedora Commons (receiver)\nApache Marmotta (receiver)\nCarbon LDP (receiver)\nLinked Edit Rules (sender)\nSolid (sender, receiver, consumer)\nVirtuoso Universal Server (receiver, consumer)Any Linked Data Platform (LDP) implementations are also conforming Linked Data Notification receivers as LDN is a strict subset of LDP.\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Warcha salt mine": "Warcha salt mine is an active salt mine located in village Warcha, Khushab District of Punjab, Pakistan, with over 1 billion tonnes reserves of 98% pure (on-average), transparent and crystalline Sodium chloride salt. Warcha salt mine was launched in 1872, and is still producing over 200,000 tons of rock salt annually with capacity to doubling up its productions.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the Mughal era, Warcha was a princely state ruled by phulial family, a sub caste of Awan tribe. The ruler of the state was called the Chief of Warcha. Nawab Surkhuru was the last Chief of Warcha. In 1834, after the end of Mughal Empire, Sardar Hari Singh Nalwan, the Commander in Chief of Sikh Army conquered and took control of Warcha including all local mines.In 1860s, the British government took over the Warcha. And they gave administrative control of all local mines to the Excise and Custom Department of British India, which for the first time introduced the room and pillar mining method in the Warcha. They later started development of the main mine in 1868, which started production in 1872.In 1962, Warcha salt mine was handed over to the West Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation.

It was so named in 1957 by the New Zealand Northern Survey Party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1956\u201358) because it was necessary to make a detour on the way up the Mackay Glacier, passing south of this nunatak.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n This article incorporates public domain material from the United States Geological Survey document: \"Detour Nunatak\".

    "Shan script": "The Shan script is a Brahmic abugida used for writing Shan language which was derived from the Burmese script.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe old Shan script used until the 1960s did not differentiate all vowels and diphthongs and had only one tone marker and a single form could represent up to 15 sounds. Only the well-trained were able to read Shan. This has been fixed, making the modern Shan alphabet easy to read, with all tones indicated unambiguously.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe Shan script is characterised by its circular letters, which are very similar to those of the Mon script. The standard Shan script is an abugida, all letters having an inherent vowel a. Vowels are represented in the form of diacritics placed around the consonants.\n\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThe representation of the vowels depends partly on whether the syllable has a final consonant. They have been arranged in a manner to show the logical relationships between the medial and the final forms and between the individual vowels and the vowel clusters they help form.\n\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThe Shan alphabet is much less complex than the Thai one and lacks the notions of high-class, mid-class and low-class consonants, distinctions which help the Thai alphabet to number some 44 consonants. Shan has only 19 consonants and all tones are clearly indicated with unambiguous tonal markers at the end of the syllable (in the absence of any marker, the default is the rising tone).\nThe number of consonants in a textbook may vary: there are 19 universally accepted Shan consonants (\u1075 \u1076 \u1004 \u1078 \u101e \u107a \u1010 \u1011 \u107c \u1015 \u107d \u107e \u1019 \u101a \u101b \u101c \u101d \u1081 \u1022) and five more which represent sounds not found in Shan, g, z, b, d and th ([\u03b8] as in \"thin\").  These five (\u1077 \u1079 \u107f \u107b \u1080) are quite rare. In addition, most editors include a dummy consonant used to support leading vowels. A textbook may therefore present 18-24 consonants.\n\n\n=== Tones ===\nThe tones are indicated by tone markers at the end of the syllable (represented by a dash in the following table), namely:\n\nWhile the reformed script originally used only four diacritic tone markers, equivalent to the five tones spoken in the southern dialect, the Lashio-based Shan Literature and Culture Association now, for a number of words, promotes the use of the 'yak khuen' to denote the sixth tone as pronounced in the north.\n\n\n== Numerals ==\nThere are differences between the numerals used by the Shan script in China and Myanmar. The numerals in Shan in China are similar to the numbers in Tham script and Tai Le script in China and the numbers in Burmese, while the Shan numerals in Myanmar form their own system, similar to the Burmese Tai Le numerals.\n\n\n== Punctuation ==\n\n\n== Unicode ==\nThe Shan script has been encoded as a part of the Myanmar block with the release version of Unicode 3.0.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Old Port": "The Old Port (sometimes known as the Old Port Exchange) is a district of Portland, Maine, known for its cobblestone streets, 19th-century brick buildings and fishing piers.  The district is filled with boutiques, restaurants and bars. Because of its reputation for nightlife, the Old Port is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Old Port district is located on the southeast side of the Portland peninsula, overlooking the wide mouth of the Fore River.  It is bounded on the east by Franklin Street (United States Route 1A), with Commercial Street southwest along the waterfront, with 19th century buildings on its north side as far west as Maple Street.  It extends inland as far as Federal Street, between Pearl and Temple Streets, with Fore and Middle Streets as major cross streets that very roughly parallel the waterfront.  The shore area on the southeast side of commercial street is lined with wharves.A large portion of this area has been designated a historic district, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the \"Portland Waterfront Historic District\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Portland peninsula was first settled in the 17th century, but was abandoned during the French and Indian Wars of the late 17th and early 18th centuries.  It was resettled, and incorporated as Falmouth in 1718.  It prospered economically in the 18th century due to the lumber trade, particularly the trade in virgin trees used as ship masts.  At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, a large part of the city was destroyed by fire in a British raid in October 1775.  The city rebuilt, and again became a major shipping center and Maine's leading port and economic center.  Commercial Street was created by fill in the 1850s, and Middle and Exchanges Street area developed as a major commercial district.  In 1866 a major fire swept through the area, bringing on a wave of new construction.The Old Port was transformed in the 1970s when real estate developers purchased derelict buildings and refurbished them into apartments, condos, offices and retail space. A new group of restaurants emerged that included The Hollow Reed on Fore Street that are cited for influencing the city's current restaurant culture. During that same decade, the Old Port Association formed and helped halt the city's demolition of historic buildings (see: Portland (Maine) Union Station) and lobbied for street scape improvements. The Cumberland County Civic Center was built at the top of the Old Port in 1977. In the early 1980s, Congress passed the Economic Recovery Tax Act, which provided tax incentives for redevelopment projects, and spurred further development in the district.In 2006, construction began on the Ocean Gateway project. The Ocean Gateway serves as the city's cruise ship terminal.\n\n\n== Old Port Festival ==\nThe Old Port Festival is a yearly one-day festival which takes place in the Old Port. For the first 36 years (1973-2009), it took place on the first Sunday in June. However, noting weather patterns which consistently brought rain storms on that day, organizers moved the Festival to the second Sunday in June 2010, avoiding heavy rain. In 2009, Festival organizers sought to create the world's largest lobster roll as part of the festival. It included 48 pounds of lobster meat and 4 gallons of mayonnaise. It measured 61 feet and 9.5 inches long. Pieces of the roll were sold to benefit a youth association. In 1998, the event included children games, including a petting zoo and miniature golf. In June 2019, the final Old Port Festival occurred, though some area business owners sought to continue the event.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExchange Street (Maine)\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Portland, Maine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPortland Downtown District\nPortland Old Port Nightlife",

    "Tom Graham (rugby union)": "Thomas Cooper Graham (12 November 1866 \u2013 1 December 1945) was an England-born Welsh rugby union international forward who played club rugby for Newport. He won 12 caps for Wales and was seen as intelligent, mobile forward player. Graham is most notable within rugby for his captaincy of Newport, which saw the team through one of their most successful periods, including the 1891\u201392 \"invincible\" season.\n\n\n== Club career ==\nBorn in Newcastle upon Tyne in the North of England, Graham had left Tyneside to find work in Newport. While in Newport he joined the rugby club, making his debut on 15 October 1886 against the Cardiff Harlequins. In 1888, Graham was part of the Newport team to face the first Southern hemisphere touring team the New Zealand M\u0101oris. Led by Theo Harding, Newport were out-muscled by the M\u0101oris, losing three tries to nil. By 1890, Graham had been made the team captain, an honour he would hold for four consecutive seasons.\nThe Newport team of the time included several players who were part of Wales's first Triple Crown-winning side. Graham's vice captain was Wales front row specialist Jim Hannan, while the rest of the team included internationals Arthur Boucher, Harry Packer, Harry Day and Welsh rugby legend Arthur Gould. Graham initiated a policy of weekly training in the teams gymnasium and an avoidance of alcohol. Welsh sports journalist 'Dromio' wrote that under Graham's captaincy '...the dressing room became a school for footballers'.During the 1891\u201392 season, Newport, under the captaincy of Graham, played 33 games, winning 29, drawing 4 and losing none. With 72 goals and 95 tries scored and only three goals and five tries conceded, it was one of the greatest seasons in the team's history.\n\n\n== International career ==\nGraham made his international debut for Wales in a match against Ireland as part of the 1890 Home Nations Championship. Under the captaincy of team mate Gould, Wales drew the game 3\u20133 with the Welsh points coming from a try from another Newport player, Charlie Thomas. Although Graham missed the next Wales game, the opening match of the 1891 Championship to England at Newport's Rodney Parade, he was reselected for the final two games of the tournament.\nAfter playing two matches for Wales in a disappointing 1892 season, Graham played his only full Home Nations Championship in 1893. After a narrow win over England in the opening game at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales were on fine form in an away victory over Scotland. The last match at Stradey Park saw Wales beat Ireland and lift the Triple Crown for the first time in the country's history. Graham would play four more matches for Wales over the next two seasons, though would only play in one more win for his country, in a match against Scotland in 1894. In Graham's penultimate international game he scored his only points for his country, when he scored a try at St. Helen's in 1895.\n\n\n=== International matches played ===\nWales\n England 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895\n Ireland 1890, 1891, 1893\n Scotland 1891, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895\n\n\n== External links ==\nNewport RFC player profiles\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAlcock, C.W.; Hill, Rowland (1997).

He granted a Foral charter to the town at the same time, encouraging the development of the town.\nAfonso III (1248\u20131279) granted to the village in 1258 a second Foral Charter, promising privileges to the town.\nIn 1361 the traffic between Portugal and Galicia was required to pass through Melga\u00e7o demonstrating its importance at the time.\nIn the context of the 1383-1385 Portuguese succession crisis, the village and its castle followed the northern region of Portugal by expressing loyalty to Beatriz. It fell into Spanish hands but in early 1387, then governed by a Spanish mayor, the town suffered the harassment of the Portuguese troops under the command of John I (1385\u20131433), resisting their take over for nearly two months.\nIn 1492, Melga\u00e7o was one of only five places along the Spanish-Portuguese border where the Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain could enter Portugal. Still under the reign of King Manuel I, village defenses and its castle layout are figured in the  Duarte de Armas (Book of Fortresses, c. 1509), made up of three towers and two gates.\n\n\n=== Present day ===\nIt is classified as a National Monument by decree published on June 23, 1910, and the wall of the village been classified in the same way, with publication on February 19, 1926.The intervention of the government, however, only came to be felt in the 1960s, keeping the construction characteristics of the set. Recently, with the development of the village's historic core recovery projects, the keep of the castle was reclassified as a museum center, exposing the testimonies obtained by archaeological research.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe castle has plant in circular shape, unusual in the country, divided into three precincts. The walls, where they tear two doors are surmounted by prismatic battlements and reinforced by three towers, the main one being that is focused on the urban core, pentagonal section. The set is dominated by the keep. The keep has a square shaped plan, isolated in the center of the parade ground. Both she and the surrounding wall were fully rebuilt, inferring to its Romanesque feature only the design of this set: a solid square tower isolated in the center of the walled enclosure. The tower is divided internally into three floors, illuminated by some chinks. The crown is made by a shot in counter with battlements, now reclassified as lookout of the archaeological museum established in the tower dependencies. Regarding the doors, they are two: the main gate to the west, larger, go to the square of weapons, which opens a cistern, where he would find the commander's residence; and the betrayal door to the north, smaller. They remain part of the Barbican on the main door and towers that flanked one of the doors of the fence. Thanks to recent archaeological research, which laid bare significant stretches of gothic fence, we can now make the idea of the original design.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Castelo de Melga\u00e7o (category) at Wikimedia Commons",

Her doctoral thesis focused on Wittgensteinian moral realism. While pursuing her doctorate, O'Connor also acted as an instructor of philosophy at the University of Minnesota from 1994 to 1995, and an instructor of philosophy at Moorhead State University from 1995 to 1996.  After completing her doctorate, O'Connor accepted a position as Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Gustavus Adolphus College from 1996 to 1999, before accepting a position as Assistant Professor of Women's Studies at Gustavus Adolphus. She was raised to Associate Professor in 2003, and to full Professor in 2007 in both Philosophy and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.

She has also edited a pair of books, contributed a number of book and encyclopedia chapters, and published a number of journal articles.O'Connor's first book, published in 2002, was titled Oppression and Responsibility: A Wittgensteinian Approach to Social Practices and Moral Theory, and drew on a primarily Wittgensteinian framework to articulate various forms of political oppression (focusing on forms she views as primarily invisible because their existence relies on rarely questioned assumptions,) and to put forward a theory of moral responsibility. Her second book, published in 2008, was titled  Morality and Our Complicated Form of Life: Feminist Wittgensteinian Metaethics and opposed both realist and antirealist positions to metaethics, suggesting instead a Wittgensteinian approach that she refers to as \"felted contextualism.\"O'Connor's third book will explore issues of addiction and recovery through the lens of philosophy. In an interview on her book, she states: \"Addicts are frequently very philosophical; we tend to be armchair thinkers. Addicts struggle with issues of self-identity, self-knowledge and self-deception, the nature of God, existential dilemmas, marking the line between appearance and reality, free will and voluntariness, and moral responsibility. These are prompted by acute instances of self-examination and reflection about how to live well.\"O'Connor also maintains a blog on Psychology Today that deals with the philosophy of addiction, contributes to the New York Times' Opinionator and The Stone blogs about similar topics, and co-maintains the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's article about topics in feminism.\n\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nO'Connor, Peg; Scheman, Naomi (2002).

Abebrese and Kwaku Obeng Boateng, it was filmed entirely in Ghana on a micro-budget, with local crew and several first-time actors. The film tells the story of Kojo, who is left to die in an abandoned gold mine, as his young daughter Esi travels through a spirit land to save him.\nIt had its world premiere in New York on 21 September 2018, at the Urban World Film Festival, where it was recognized as Best Narrative Feature (World Cinema).

It is distributed by ARRAY and was released on streaming service Netflix on 31 March 2019, making it the first Ghanaian film to premiere in selected countries worldwide, on Netflix.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nEsi recounts her childhood in rural Ghana, where she lives in a village in a lake similar to the real-life village, Nzulezo, built on stilts, with her father Kojo and her mother Ama, who supplies most of the family's small income through sewing. Kojo grew up in a large city but fled to the village after a tragic event, feeling that \"only water could cleanse the past.\" Esi is close to her father, who takes her around the lake in his boat and tells her stories whose beginnings only make sense if you know their endings. An unexpected visitor \u2014 an old blind man from \"the realm in-between\" where \"everything is upside down\" \u2014 arrives in the village and entrusts Esi with a sacred white bird that he says is being hunted by the crow who rules the land in-between.\nSoon thereafter, the family receives another unexpected visitor \u2014 Esi's uncle Kwabena, from whom Kojo has been estranged. Kwabena persuades Kojo to bring his family to the city from which Kojo had fled seven years before. There, they live with Esi's grandmother, with whom Esi watches a Spanish-language Mexican telenovela featuring a conflict between two brothers who love the same woman. It transpires that Kojo and Kwabena had also once loved the same woman, who had died on the day of her wedding to Kwabena due to Kojo driving drunk. Kwabena, however, says that the past is the past, and wants Kojo to join him in illegal small-scale gold mining to make money. Initially reluctant, Kojo is finally persuaded, and goes with his brother to an old mine on property now owned by a Chinese company. Without warning, Kwabena pushes Kojo into an abandoned mineshaft and runs away. Esi and Ama go to the police to report Kojo missing. Esi continues to have visions of the \"crow who ruled the land in-between.\" She realizes that the crow is her uncle Kwabena, who also died in the drunk driving accident seven years before, and the sacred white bird is her father, and that only she can find him.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nCynthia Dankwa as Esi\nAma K.

It will leave many who see it eager for the young filmmaker's next fable.\" Brian Costello of Common Sense Media wrote, \"This is a lush and beautiful film, filled with dazzling images drawn as much from magical realism as from the setting itself.\"\n\n\n=== Awards ===\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Burial of Kojo at IMDb",
    "Kim Adams": "Kim Adams (born 17 December 1951) is a Canadian sculptor who is known for his assemblages combining prefabricated elements, often parts of cars or other machine-made structures. His visual style is influenced by industrial design, architecture and automotive design. His large-scale sculptures incorporate the model railroading technique of kitbashing, and bright stock colours. They may be shown in a park or street as well as in a museum setting. His small surreal landscapes are toy-sized, and may be installed on shelves.\n\n\n== Career ==\nAdams was born in Edmonton and studied painting at the Northwest Institute of the Arts (1974), the Kootenay School of Art (1974-1975), and the University of Victoria (1975-1977), where he received an MFA in 1979. At the University of Victoria, he was taught by teachers with competing aesthetics, Mowry Baden and Roland Brener. By 1976, Adams was an abstract painter, but knew that sculpture and installation were his future. Despite his formal education, Adams found much of his inspiration outside the classroom.Adams\u2019s sculpture work is composed of different parts: architectural structures, street events and miniature models of landscapes and architecture. His practice grew from creating miniature models in the 1980s to life-size sculptures and installations. In Toaster Work Wagon (1997), Adams assembled bicycles, lawn chairs, and parts of a 1960 Volkswagen bus. For his Autolamp (2008), he used the shell of a 1985 Dodge Ram which through holes which perforate it, gives light, transforming it into a glowing structure. The Mendel Art Gallery acquired Kim Adams' sculpture Love Birds (1998-2010) in 2013 composed of 11 foot tall sculptures - made from water barrels, grain-silo caps, and parts of two Ford Econoline vans.Since the 1980s, Adams has participated in solo and group exhibitions in Canada, Australia, the United States and Europe. In 1997, Adams participated in the international exhibition Skulptur Projekte 97, M\u00fcnster, Germany. His major work for that project was Auto Office House,  permanently installed on the flat roof of a former 1950s gas station, now the Caf\u00e9 Gasolin. More recently, his work was shown at the 2012 Kim Adams: One for the Road, Museum London, London, ON, and at Art Gallery of Ontario in an exhibition titled Kim Adams: Recent Works in 2013.His work is included in many major public collections such as the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Art Gallery of Ontario, the National Gallery of Canada, and the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, Holland. His Brueghel-Bosch Bus (1997-ongoing, sculpture-installation) is permanently installed at the Art Gallery of Hamilton. In 2001, he created a permanent outdoor work for the Vancouver Art Gallery.In 2012, Adams received the Gershon Iskowitz Prize. In 2013, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship, from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. In 2014, Adams won the Governor General's Award in Visual and Media Arts.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKim Adams at the Wynick/Tuck Gallery\nKim Adams at the Canadian Contemporary Art Database",

In the early 1980s the banking industry in West Africa was dominated by foreign and state-owned banks. There were hardly any commercial banks in West Africa owned and managed by the African private sector. ETI was founded with the objective of filling this vacuum.\nThe Federation of West African Chambers of Commerce promoted and initiated a project for the creation of a private regional banking institution in West Africa. In 1984, Ecopromotions S.A. was incorporated. Its founding shareholders raised the seed capital for the feasibility studies and the promotional activities leading to the creation of ETI.\nIn October 1985, ETI was incorporated with an authorised capital of US$100 million. The initial paid up capital of US$32 million was raised from over 1,500 individuals and institutions from West African countries. The largest shareholder was the ECOWAS Fund for Cooperation, Compensation and Development (ECOWAS Fund), the development finance arm of ECOWAS. A Headquarters\u2019 Agreement was signed with the government of Togo in 1985 which granted ETI the status of an international organisation with the rights and privileges necessary for it to operate as a regional institution, including the status of a non-resident financial institution.\nETI has two specialised subsidiaries: Ecobank Development Corporation (EDC) and eProcess International (eProcess). EDC was incorporated with a broad mandate to develop Ecobank\u2019s investment banking and advisory businesses throughout the countries where Ecobank operates. EDC operates brokerage houses on all 3 stock exchanges in West Africa and has obtained licences to operate on the two stock exchanges in Central Africa: the Douala Stock Exchange in Cameroon and the Libreville Exchange in Gabon. The mandate of eProcess is to manage the Group\u2019s information technology function with a view to ultimately centralising the Group\u2019s middle and back office operations to improve efficiency, service standards and reduce costs.\n\n\n== Governance lapses ==\nEcobank has been marred by several well publicized governance lapses:\nThe sacking and reinstatement of the CFO in 2014 after she alleged:  \"... Mrs. Do Rego sent a letter to the SEC alleging that the Chairman, Mr. Lawson and GCEO Mr.Tanoh were attempting to sell non-core assets at values below market, that both individuals \u2018attempted\u2019 to manipulate the 2012 results to enable the Group (ETI) to show a much better 2013 growth, and she questioned procedures around the approval of a substantial increase in Mr.Tanoh\u2019s 2012 bonus (which he subsequently opted not to receive). She also alleged that she was asked to write off debts owed by a real estate company Mr. Lawson chairs...\"The Chairman resigned but later sued Ecobank to force them to investigate the allegations backed by an confidential E&Y audit report on serious allegations of Fraud.\n\" As the Chairman of the Board at the time the EY investigation was commissioned, I instructed my lawyers to write a letter to the Board expressly warning them of the illegality of presenting these accounts to the shareholders without making full disclosure of the facts. This letter was delivered to board members on the 26th June 2014 (See Appendix 1). Unfortunately the letter was ignored by the Board of ETI and this obvious dereliction of duty continues to date\"Ecobank then settled the matter with the chairman and absolved him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\n== Subsidiaries ==\nThe Specialized subsidiary companies of Ecobank include the following:\n\nEBI SA Groupe Ecobank - Paris, France\nEBI SA Representative Office - London, United Kingdom\nEcobank Development Corporation (EDC) - Lom\u00e9, Togo\nEDC Investment Corporation - Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nEDC Investment Corporation - Douala, Cameroon\nEDC Securities Limited - Lagos, Nigeria\nEDC Stockbrokers Limited - Accra, Ghana\nEcobank Asset Management - Abidjan, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\ne-Process International SA - Accra, Ghana\nEcobank Asset Management Company P/L - Harare, Zimbabwe\n\n\n== The Ecobank Nedbank alliance ==\nWith more than 1,500 branches in 35 countries, the Ecobank-Nedbank Alliance is the largest banking network in Africa.

    "Han Taiwanese": "Han Taiwanese or Taiwanese Han (Chinese: \u81fa\u7063\u6f22\u4eba)  are a Taiwanese ethnic group, most of whom are of full or partial Han descent. According to the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, they comprise 95 to 97 percent of the Taiwanese population, which also includes Austronesians and other non-Han people. Major waves of Han immigration occurred since the 17th century to the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, with the exception of the Japanese colonial period (1895-1945). Han Taiwanese mainly speak three languages of Chinese: Mandarin, Hokkien and Hakka.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nThere is no simple uniform definition of Han Taiwanese, which are estimated to comprise 95 to 98 percent of the Taiwanese population. To determine if a Taiwanese is Han, common criteria include immigration background (from continental East Asia), using a Han language as their mother tongue, and observance of traditional Han festivals. Sometimes a negative definition is employed, where Han people are those who are not non-Han.Taiwanese Han ethnic groups include the Hoklo people and Hakka people that had arrived in Taiwan before World War II (sometimes called \"benshengren\"), as well those and other Han people that arrived shortly after World War II (sometimes called \"waishengren\"). The distinction between benshengren and waishengren is now less important due to intermarriages and the rise of a Taiwanese identity. In addition, there are Han Taiwanese that do not fall into the above categories, including the Puxian-speaking people in Wuqiu Township, Kinmen County, the Mindong-speaking people in Matzu, and various newly arrived Han immigrants.\n\n\n== Immigration history and demographics ==\n\nThere were two major waves of Han immigration: 1) during the Qing dynasty in the 18th and 19th centuries and 2) from Republic of China's mainland area, which is now ruled by the People's Republic of China, in the final years of the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949).\n\n\n=== Before Imperial Japanese rule ===\nTaiwan's southwest was home to a Chinese population numbering close to 1,500 before the Dutch first came in 1623. From 1624 to 1662, they began to encourage large-scale Han immigration to the island for labour, mainly from the what is today south Fujian.\nStarting from 1683, the Qing government limited immigration to Taiwan. Such restriction was relaxed following the 1760s, and by 1811 there were more than two million ethnic Chinese in Taiwan. The 1926 census counted 3,116,400 and 586,300 Han people originating from the Hok-kien and Kwang-tung provinces (roughly Fujian and Guangdong today) during the Ming or Qing dynasty.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\n\nAround 800,000 people, the vast majority being Han, immigrated to Taiwan after the end of the World War II, when Republic of China took over Taiwan, with the biggest wave taking place around the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland in 1949. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a small amount of Han immigration from the PRC into Taiwan. It mainly consists of two categories--brides of businessmen who work on the mainland, and women who have married rural Taiwanese, mostly through a marriage broker.Around 20% or 34,000 of the Vietnamese people in Taiwan are Hoa people, people of Chinese origin that are mostly Han.\n\n\n== Interactions among Han immigrants ==\n\n\n=== Qing Dynasty ===\n\n\n==== Conflicts ====\n\nThere were violent ethnic conflicts (termed \"\u5206\u985e\u68b0\u9b25\" in government documents of the Qing Dynasty), which played a major role in determining the distribution of different groups of Han peoples in Taiwan. Most conflicts were between people of Chang-chow and Chin-chew origins which includes acts where Quanzhounese fought against Hakka peasants from the southwestern hills of Fujian (Tingzhou and western Zhangzhou) throughout the period. (\"\u6f33\u6cc9\u68b0\u9b25\", Chang-Chin conflicts) and between people of Hokkien and Hakkas origins (\"\u95a9\u7cb5\u68b0\u9b25\" [Min-Yue conflicts]) where Hoklo people united to fight against the Hakkas who largely came from Guangdong and a minority from Fujian, is called (\"\u95a9\u5ba2\u68b0\u9b25\" [Min-Hakka conflicts]).\nTrying to be a mediator, T\u0113\u207f I\u014dng-sek (\u912d\u7528\u932b, 10 June 1788 \u2013 21 March 1858), the first Taiwanese to achieve the highest degree, jinshi or \"Doctor\" (Mandarin: \u9032\u58eb), in the imperial examination of the Qing Dynasty, wrote an article On Reconciliation (\u52f8\u548c\u8ad6). Similar literary works on conflicts between different ethnic subgroups include H\u00e1i-Im Poems (\u6d77\u97f3\u8a69) by L\u00e2u Ka-B\u00f4o (\u5289\u5bb6\u8b00, 1814-1853) and To the Min and Yue people (\u8aed\u95a9\u7cb5\u6c11\u4eba) by N\u00e2 T\u00edng-Gu\u00e2n (\u85cd\u9f0e\u5143, 19 September 1680 - 1 August 1733).\n\n\n==== Cultural assimilation ====\nIn some regions, where the majority of the population spoke another language, the minority group sometimes adopted the more dominant language and lost their original language. This most commonly occurred with Hakka migrants, who adopted either Quanzhou or Zhangzhou Minnanese; they are referred to as \"minnanized\" Hakka people (\u798f\u4f6c\u5ba2).\n\n\n==== Han people with different surnames ====\nThere were also conflicts between people with different surnames, such as those between different clans in Yilan. While Han people in some other places were prohibited from marrying others with the same surname, Han people in Yilan were discouraged from marrying others with a different surname.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nUnlike pre-World War II, when Han immigrants were predominantly of Hok-kien and Hakka origins, post-World War II Han people came from all over mainland China. Their different languages, habits, ideologies and relationships with the Republic of China government sometimes led to conflicts between these two groups.\n\n\n== Interactions with non-Han inhabitants ==\nIn Taiwan, the Han people came into contact with the Austronesians, Dutch, Spanish and Japanese.\n\n\n=== Han people and Austronesians ===\nThe Amis term for Han people is payrag.\nAccording to the historian Melissa J. Brown, within the Taiwanese Minnan (Hoklo) community itself, differences in culture indicate the degree to which mixture with Austronesians took place, with most pure Hoklo Han in Northern Taiwan having almost no Austronesian admixture, which is limited to Hoklo Han in Southern Taiwan. Plains aborigines who were mixed and assimilated into the Hoklo Han population at different stages were differentiated between \"short-route\" and \"long-route\". The ethnic identity of assimilated Plains aboriginals in the immediate vicinity of Tainan was still known since a Taiwanese girl from an old elite Hoklo family was warned by her mother to stay away from them. The insulting name \"\u756a\u4ed4\" (huan-a) was used against plains aborigines by the Taiwanese, and the Hoklo Taiwanese speech was forced upon Aborigines like the Pazeh people. Hoklo Taiwanese has replaced Pazeh and driven it to near extinction. Aboriginal status has been requested by plains aboriginals.\n\n\n== Biological traits and relationships with other Taiwanese/Asian people ==\n\n\n=== Genetic relationships ===\nPart of the maximum-likelihood tree of 75 Asian populations:\n\n\n=== Alcohol metabolism ===\nIn Taiwan, the prevalence of alcohol dependence among the Han is 10 times lower than that of Austronesians, which is related to genetic, physical, psychological, social, environmental, and cultural factors. An association study by researchers at the Academia Sinica found that genes in alcohol metabolism pathway, especially ADH1B and ALDH2, conferred the major genetic risk for alcohol dependence in Taiwanese Han men.\n\n\n== Languages ==\n\nThe languages used by Han Taiwanese include Mandarin (entire country), Hokkien (Taiwan proper and Kinmen), Hakka (Taiwan proper), Mindong (Matzu), Puxian (Wuqiu Island, Kinmen), and other Han languages spoken by some post-World War II immigrants or immigrants from mainland China since the 1990s. The writing systems used include Han characters, Han phonetic notations such as Mandarin Phonetic Symbols for Mandarin and Taiwanese Phonetic Symbols for Minnan and Hakka, and the Latin alphabet for various romanization systems, including Tongyong Pinyin, Wade\u2013Giles, Gwoyeu Romatzyh and Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II for Mandarin, POJ and Taiwanese Minnan Romanization System for Minnan, and Hakka Romanization System for Hakka.\nSignificant numbers of Puxian Min, Fuzhounese, and Teochew speakers came to Taiwan proper, but they were eventually assimilated into the Hokkien (Minnan) speaking population.\n\n\n=== Linguistic Diversity ===\nThe Taiwanese linguist Uijin Ang divided Taiwan (excluding Kinmen and Matsu) into 7 linguistic regions, including one Austronesian, five Han and one mixed.\n\n\n=== Influence of Non-Han Languages ===\nEver since the arrival of Han immigrants in Taiwan, their languages have undergone changes through interactions with other Han or non-Han languages. For example, one unit of land area used in Taiwanese Minnan is Kah (\u7532; 0.9699 acre), which comes from the Dutch word for \"field\", akker (akker > \u963f\u7532 > \u7532).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe most popular religions of Han Taiwanese are Taoism and Buddhism. With 11,796 temples (78.4% Taoist; 19.6% Buddhist), Taiwan is the country with the highest density of temples in the world.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Surnames ===\n\n\n==== Han surnames in Taiwan ====\nIn traditional Han society, children inherit the surname of the father. Population analyses of Han Taiwanese based on the short tandem repeat sequences on the Y chromosome, which is specific to males, shows high haplotype diversity in most surname groups. Except for rare ones, the origins of Han surnames in Taiwan are pretty heterogeneous.\n\n\n==== Han surnames used by Austronesian Taiwanese ====\n\nThe naming customs of the Austronesian people in Taiwan have been greatly endangered by the dominant Han culture under the rule of Qing and Republic of China or Japanese culture during the Japanization period. Austronesians were often forced to have surnames in Han characters that, depending on the policies then, may or may not be related to their original surnames.\n\n\n=== Villages ===\nConfucian temples formed an important part of the life of early Han immigrants. Famous temples include Taiwan Confucian Temple and Taipei Confucius Temple.\n\n\n=== Written Records/Literature ===\n\nOne of the earliest written records of Taiwanese Hakka is A Tragic Ballad about Hakka Sailing to Taiwan (\u6e21\u53f0\u60b2\u6b4c), a work written in the Raoping dialect about the life and struggle of Hakka immigrants to Taiwan under the Ching rule.\n\n\n=== Folk literature: Tales and Legends ===\nOne of the best known Han folktales in Taiwan is the Grandaunt Tiger.\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nTaiwanese architecture refers to a style of buildings constructed by the Han people, and is a branch of Chinese architecture. The style is generally afforded to buildings constructed before the modernization under Japanese occupation, in the 1930s. Different groups of Han immigrants differ in their styles of architecture. Being far away from the center of political power of Beijing, buildings were constructed free of construction standards. This, coupled with inferior level of expertise of artisans and craftsmen, and the Japanese colonization, the architectural style diverged from the ones on the mainland. Many traditional houses have been designated national monuments by the Taiwanese government, such as the Lin Family Mansion and Garden and the House of T\u0113\u207f I\u014dng-sek (\u912d\u7528\u932b).\n\n\n=== Handicrafts ===\nHakka Taiwanese have long traditions of indigo dyeing.The Yilan International Children's Folklore and Folkgame Festival exhibits collections of traditional Han Taiwanese toys.\n\n\n=== Arts and Music ===\n\n\n=== Films ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n=== Other Taiwanese ethnic groups ===\n\n\n=== Languages of Han Taiwanese ===\n\n\n=== History of Han Taiwanese ===\n\n\n=== Culture of Han Taiwanese ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTaiwan Folklore & Folk Culture (National Taiwan University OpenCourseWare)",

    "Actin, alpha skeletal muscle": "Actin, alpha skeletal muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the ACTA1 gene.Actin alpha 1 which is expressed in skeletal muscle is one of six different actin isoforms which have been identified. Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in cell motility, structure and integrity. Alpha actins are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus.\n\n\n== Skeletal actin gene expression ==\nSkeletal alpha actin expression is induced by stimuli and conditions known to cause muscle formation. Such conditions result in fusion of committed cells (satellite cells) into myotubes, to form muscle fibers. Skeletal actin itself, when expressed, causes expression of several other \"myogenic genes\", which are essential to muscle formation. One key transcription factor that activates skeletal actin gene expression is Serum Response Factor (\"SRF\"), a protein that binds to specific sites on the promoter DNA of the actin gene. SRF may bring a number of other proteins to the promoter of skeletal actin, such as androgen receptor, and thereby contribute to induction of skeletal actin gene expression by androgenic (often termed \"anabolic\") steroids.\n\n\n== Interactions ==\nActin, alpha 1 has been shown to interact with TMSB4X, MIB2 and PRKCE.\n\n\n== See also ==\nActin\nACTB\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGeneReviews/NCBI/NIH/UW entry on Nemaline Myopathy\nHuman ACTA1 genome location and ACTA1 gene details page  in the UCSC Genome Browser.",
    "JavaScript OSA": "JavaScript OSA, (originally JavaScript for OSA, abbreviated as JSOSA), is a freeware inter-process communication scripting language for the Macintosh computer.\nJavaScript OSA uses the \"core language\" of the Mozilla implementation of the JavaScript programming language, (see SpiderMonkey). The language is used as an alternative to the AppleScript language. Its use is unrelated to web browser-based scripting. It can be seen as having a similar function to Microsoft's JScript .NET language on Windows machines, although there is no interoperability between the two languages' system-level scripting.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe language is identical to Mozilla's core language, with extensions added via a \"Core\" object and a \"MacOS\" object. The MacOS object has methods for obtaining objects that are bound to applications. This is done via the AppleEvent messaging system, a part of the Macintosh's Open Scripting Architecture.\nThe language was first released in 2001, and was bundled with Late Night Software's flagship product, Script Debugger. In May 2005, a new \"alpha\" version of the language was made available for testing. This improved second version of the language was bundled with version 4 of Script Debugger. JavaScript OSA was eventually discontinued due to lack of interest and was dropped from Script Debugger 5 in 2012.\n\n\n== Alternatives ==\nOS X Yosemite introduced JavaScript for Automation (JXA): system-wide support for scripting with JavaScript, built upon JavaScriptCore and the Open Scripting Architecture.

    "Connaught (horse)": "Connaught (1965 \u2013 1987) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. Noted for his difficult temperament and front-running style he won seven of his sixteen races in a track career which lasted from October 1967 to July 1970. Owned and bred by Jim Joel, he was trained by Noel Murless and ridden in most of his races by Sandy Barclay.\nAs a two-year-old he showed great promise at home but refused to enter the starting stalls on his scheduled debut and then finished fifth in the Observer Gold Cup. In 1968 he ran poorly in the 2000 Guineas but proved himself a top class colt by running second to Sir Ivor in The Derby after looking likely to win entering the final furlong. Later that year he won the King Edward VII Stakes and Great Voltigeur Stakes but ran badly when favourite for the St Leger Stakes. As a four-year-old he won the Coronation Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes in the first half of the season before succumbing to a respiratory infection. At five he was unbeaten in three races, taking the Westbury Stakes and a second Prince of Wales's Stakes before ending his racing career with a win in the Eclipse Stakes.\nAfter his retirement from racing he had steady success as a breeding stallion. He died in 1987.\n\n\n== Background ==\nConnaught was a \"big, burly, immensely powerful\" bay horse with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs bred in the United Kingdom by his owner Jim Joel. He was sired by St. Paddy the winner of The Derby and St. Leger Stakes in 1960. His dam Nagaika won the Solario Stakes as a two-year-old in 1956 and was bought by Joel a year later. As a broodmare she had already produced Court Sentence, who won the St James's Palace Stakes in 1962. Nagaika was the great-granddaughter of Neomenie, a mare whose other descendants included the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Nikellora.The colt was sent into training with Noel Murless at his Warren Place Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Murless had been British flat racing Champion Trainer on five occasions before taking charge of Connaught and went on to win the four more championships. The horse was ridden in all of his major races by the young Scottish jockey Sandy Barclay who had been Champion Apprentice in 1966, before becoming Murless's stable jockey in 1968.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 1967: two-year-old season ===\nConnaught built up a big reputation in training gallops but his first racecourse appearance a complete failure. He was scheduled to make his debut in the Convivial Maiden Stakes at York Racecourse in August 1967 but refused to enter the starting stalls and was withdrawn from the race. In October he was entered in the Observer Gold Cup at Doncaster Racecourse (the most valuable event for two-year-olds run in Britain) and finished fifth behind Vaguely Noble.\n\n\n=== 1968: three-year-old season ===\nConnaught made good progress in the winter of 1967/1968 and was expected to run well in his seasonal debut in the Greenham Stakes but again refused to enter the stalls and did not take part. Despite his temperamental problems he was well backed for the 2000 Guineas and started at odds of 13/2 but after showing good speed in the early stages he faded to finish ninth of the ten runners behind Sir Ivor. When moved up in distance for the Chester Vase over one and a half miles he showed better form when finishing second to Remand.At Epsom Downs Racecourse he started at odds of 100/9 for the 189th running of the Derby Stakes, for which Sir Ivor started 4/5 favourite in a field of thirteen colts. Attempting to become the first maiden to win the race since Merry Hampton in 1887, Connaught was positioned in second by Barclay before taking the lead at half way. In the straight, the colt opened up a clear lead over his opponents and looked certain to win before Lester Piggott produced Sir Ivor with a late run on the outside. Connaught was overtaken well inside the final furlong and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. Commenting on the race more than forty years later, Barclay said \"The Derby on Connaught was a shattering, bone-crushing moment but, to finish so close, still opened a lot of doors for a 20-year-old. Riding at Epsom like that was a childhood dream and within sight of the post I'd won the Derby. I'm thinking to myself: `dreams must come true after all' and then all of a sudden this thing flies past me as if I was in a different race\". At Royal Ascot, later in June he started the 1/2 favourite for the King Edward VII Stakes and recorded his first win, beating Ribero by twelve lengths. He was scheduled to run in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July but broke away from his handler, galloped away and was subsequently withdrawn from the race.Connaught appeared to be short of full fitness when reappearing in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse in August but was nevertheless made the 1/3 favourite. After being held up by Barclay in the early stages he was beaten a neck by Riboccare in a rough finish, but was awarded the race after an inquiry by the racecourse stewards. In September, Connaught started 10/11 favourite for the 192nd running of the St Leger Stakes at Doncaster. Racing on heavy ground, he failed to reproduce his best form and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Ribero. After the race, Barclay commented that \"the ground did not suit him at all\".\n\n\n=== 1969: four-year-old season ===\nOn his first appearance as a four-year-old Connaught started the 6/5 favourite for the Coronation Stakes (now the Brigadier Gerard Stakes) over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse in May and won by six lengths from Jimmy Reppin, who finished lame. A year after his run in the Derby, Connaught returned to Epsom for the Coronation Cup over the same course and distance. He started favourite, but after taking the lead at half way he faded in the closing stages and finished third behind Park Top and Mount Athos. He never raced over one and a half miles again, with Murless being convinced that he did not stay the distance.  At Royal Ascot he started 11/10 favourite for the ten furlong Prince of Wales's Stakes and won by five lengths from Wolver Hollow, breaking the track record by four seconds. The colt then developed a respiratory infection and was off the course for three months.Connaught returned in the Scarborough Stakes over ten furlongs at Doncaster in September. His temperamental problems resurfaced as he was very reluctant to leave the pre-race paddock before finishing third to Karabas and Hotfoot. Later that month he was dropped down in distance to a mile and finished second to Jimmy Reppin in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. On his final appearance of the year he ran poorly when finishing sixth to Flossy in the Champion Stakes.\n\n\n=== 1970: five-year-old season ===\nConnaught began his fourth season by winning the Westbury Stakes (now the Gordon Richards Stakes) at Sandown in May at odds of 1/2 in \"most convincing\" style from Royal Rocket. In June he attempted repeat his 1969 success the Prince of Wales's for a second time. Starting the 10/11 favourite, he won by four lengths from Hotfoot and broke his own course record. In the Eclipse Stakes he started at odds of 5/4 against two opponents; Karabas and Nor. He delayed the race for some time as he was once again very reluctant to enter the stalls, and then almost unseated Barclay when swerving at the start. He soon recovered, took the lead after a furlong and never looked in danger of defeat, winning by two and a half lengths from Karabas. His winning time established a new course record, bettering the mark set by his sire St Paddy in 1961.\n\n\n== Assessment ==\nConnaught was given a peak Timeform rating of 130 in 1970.\n\n\n== Stud record ==\nConnaught was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion and produced a steady stream of stakes winners before being pensioned from stud duty in the mid 1980s. He died in 1987 at the age of twenty-two.\nConnaught's best winners included;\n\nSauceboat (1972), won Child Stakes\nSir Montagu (1973), won Ebor Handicap\nConnaught Ranger (1974), won Triumph Hurdle, Ascot Hurdle\nMiss Pinkie (1974), won Fillies' Mile\nCenturion (1975), won Cesarewitch Handicap\nRemainder Man (1975), won Ormonde Stakes, second 2000 Guineas, third Derby sire of One Man\nConnaught Bridge (1976), won Yorkshire Oaks, Nassau Stakes\nLa Dolce (1976), dam of Pebbles\nDukedom (1977), on White Rose Stakes\nPlayboy Jubilee (1977), won Dee Stakes\nBuffavento (1978), won Grosser Preis von Dortmund\nClare Island (1979), won Princess Elizabeth Stakes\nLirung (1982), won Prix Jacques Le Marois\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Suitland station": "Suitland is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States, approximately one mile (1.6 km) southeast of Washington, D.C. As of the 2010 census, the population of the CDP was 25,825. Prior to 2010, Suitland was part of the Suitland-Silver Hill census-designated place.\n\n\n== History ==\nSuitland is named after 19th century landowner and businessman Senator Samuel Taylor Suit, whose estate, \"Suitland,\" was located near the present-day intersection of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads.\n\n\n=== Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ===\nIn the 1600s, the Piscataway tribe inhabited the lands in southern Maryland. European settlers first visited Saint Clement's Island on the Potomac River and then established their first Maryland colony downriver at Saint Mary's City in 1634, and by the 1660s through the 1680s, settlers had moved into what is now known as Prince George's County. Faced with this encroachment, the Piscataways left the area in 1697, and moved north to what is now known as Coney Island. They eventually moved further north into Pennsylvania and Michigan. The sole export of the European settlers was tobacco, and slaves were first brought to the county in the 1700s.\n\n\n=== Nineteenth century ===\nPrior to the Civil War, tobacco production had made Prince George's County one of the wealthiest counties in Maryland, and half of the county's population was enslaved. After the war, old plantations were broken up and replaced by communities centered on small farming and country villages.\nIn 1867, Samuel Taylor Suit moved to Maryland and purchased more than 800 acres (320 ha) near Washington, D.C. In the 1870s and 1880s, such prominent guests as U.S. Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes visited the Suitland estate. It was the 1871 site of negotiations preliminary to the international tribunal in Geneva that arbitrated the Alabama Claims. After Suit's death in 1888, portions of the estate were sold (circa 1892 to 1903) to William A. Harrison, and the land was subsequently subdivided and sold over the years. Suit's son, Arthur B. Suit, retained three acres (1.2 ha) of land near the corner of Suitland and Silver Hill Roads, where he maintained a general store, a bar, a bowling alley, and the community's one-room jailhouse.\n\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nBy the turn of the century, the village of Suitland had added a post office, churches, and several houses.  On August 10, 1909, local residents met at the home of George J. Hess and organized the Suitland Improvement Association of Maryland to raise funds for a community meeting hall.  Three officers were elected to serve one-year posts: President, Dr. C. M. Emmons; Vice President, C. L. Jenkins; and Secretary and Treasurer, George J. Hess.  The Association was incorporated on November 17, 1950 and is now known as the Suitland Civic Association.There are two historic cemeteries in Suitland: Cedar Hill and Lincoln Memorial.  Cedar Hill Cemetery was founded in 1895 and built on the former Nonesuch Plantation.  Prior to 1913, it was known as Forest Lake Cemetery and was likely renamed after the cedar trees that lined both sides of Suitland Road from the D.C. line to Silver Hill Road.  Early churches performed baptisms at this location and it is also the burial site for victims of the 1906 Terra Cotta Railroad wreck.  Lincoln Memorial Cemetery was founded in 1927 on the former Landon dairy farm and is the site where many prominent African-Americans are buried.  Individuals include Dr. Charles Richard Drew, who established improved techniques for blood storage and developed large scale blood banks early in World War II, and Nannie Helen Burroughs, educator and civil rights activist.The first one-room schoolhouse was built in 1891 on land purchased by the community.  A two-room schoolhouse was later built in 1915 on Silver Hill Road, expanded to four rooms in 1922, and saw additions to the building in 1928, 1941, and 1957.Property owned by James West and Joseph Friday, located near the current intersection of Swann and Silver Hill Roads, was used as an airfield from 1938 to 1941.  Named \"Skyhaven\" by a local student who won the naming contest sponsored by West and Friday, Skyhaven Airfield hosted a flying club that served 20 small planes, including Wacos, Great Lakes, and Pipers.\nSuitland remained a rural farming community until the onset of World War II.  To meet the need for additional office space to support the war effort, in September 1941, the Public Buildings Administration awarded a $2,749,000 contract to McCloskey and Co. of Philadelphia to develop a new federal office building in Prince George's County, Maryland.  Later that year, 437 acres (177 ha) of farm and dairy land were purchased in Suitland to build the Suitland Federal Center.  The 12 existing residences on this property included the former dairy and summer home of Albert Carry, the German-American founder of the National Capital Brewing Company and the Carry Ice Cream Co.  The Suitland House, built by Lowell O. Minear, a pioneer designer of memorial parks, is the sole remaining residence on the Federal Center property.  A colonial-revival style home, it now serves as office space for the U.S. Census Bureau and is included in the Prince George's County Planning Department's 2010 Approved Historic Sites and Districts Plan.In 1942, the Suitland Manor apartments were built in anticipation of new federal workers.  Parkway Terrace, Whitehall Square, and Marlborough House developments soon followed to accommodate the influx of Census Bureau and other federal employees.  In 1943, the Census Bureau turned 14 acres (5.7 ha) of land at the Federal Center site into the largest Victory Garden in the Washington metropolitan area.  The land was a parceled into 616 plots and plowed, fertilized, and tended by census employees.  As late as 1989, 110 garden plots were still available for summer rental on a first-come, first-served basis for $7.00 each.  These gardens were located at the site of the current Naval Intelligence Building.\nIn 1944, the Suitland Parkway was opened to connect the Army's Bolling Air Force Base (Bolling Field) to the Camp Springs Army Military Reservation, later named Andrews Air Force Base and now known as Joint Base Andrews.  The 9.35 miles (15.05 km) of highway, originally named the Fighter Command Station Access Parkway, was initially limited to military use only and came under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service in 1949.\nSuitland Junior-Senior High School, was the first high school in Suitland.  The building was dedicated on November 15, 1951 to the high ideal of freedom of education, with John W. McNamara presiding as master-of-ceremonies and principal Thomas Warthen accepting the dedication on behalf of the students and faculty. Nearby was also LaReine High School, offering a Roman Catholic education for girls. LaReine was eventually closed, and its students transferred to nearby Bishop McNamara High School which became co-educational.\nThe 1950s and 1960s were a period of major growth for Suitland, as new middle and working-class families settled into the newly built residential communities.  However, this population boom came to an end around 1970 due to several converging factors.  These included the availability of cheaper land and lower taxes in neighboring county jurisdictions; the ending of the postwar baby boom; the slowdown in the rate of federal government growth; and migration patterns spurred by school busing mandates leading to regional demographic shifts.The 1970s were both the beginning of a period of population adjustment and a recognition of Suitland's unique local history.  Beginning in 1973, Prince George's County became the largest school district to adopt a busing plan after the Supreme Court's ruling on Brown v. Board of Education.  The demographic changes caused by desegregation busing changed the county, transforming a great number of neighborhoods that were formerly white and middle-class to majority black and middle-class, and these shifts are reflected in the current population demographic of the Suitland CDP.\nIn 1975, local historian Darlie Norton was elected to draft a local history of the township in preparation for Suitland's centennial celebration. A History of Suitland, Maryland, 1867\u20131976 (1976) includes a detailed history of early residents, businesses, land purchases, and the development of Suitland civic, public, and private enterprises.  That same year, local resident Walter Coley organized a committee within the Suitland Civic Association to preserve the Suitland Bog, which led to the purchase of 20 acres (8.1 ha) of woods and wetland by the Maryland National Capitol Park and Planning Commission.In the 1980s, crime associated with vandalism, property violations, landlord absenteeism, and drugs were seen as a threat to the federal workers who were now commuting into Suitland from outside the community, and in 1983, a razor wired fence was erected around the Federal Center complex.  Through most of this decade, neighborhoods near the Federal Center remained distressed and in need of a plan for positive change and growth.\nIn the mid-1990s, county executive Wayne Curry conceived a plan to revitalize Suitland as part of a greater county-wide effort to improve townships located inside the Beltway.  In 1997, as the first stage of the Prince George's County Redevelopment Authority project to reduce local crime rates and revitalize the site, the Manchester Square housing development was turned over to the county.  Two years later, the fence surrounding the Federal Center was replaced with a regular wrought iron fence. Notoriously in 2003, two business women in their 70s were murdered during a robbery at their retail flower shop on Suitland Road. As of Spring 2019,  most of the retail district along Suitland Road across from the Census Bureau has been torn down,  with plans for building new residential/retail ventures finally moving forward.\n\n\n=== Twenty-first century ===\n\nThe Suitland station on the Washington Metro's Green Line opened to the public January 13, 2001.\nIn 2004, Windsor Crossing, a $45 million multifamily condominium complex built by Stavrou Associates in partnership with the Prince George's Redevelopment Authority, was completed on the former Manchester Square development.  In 2005, the $15.7 million Suitland Elementary School was opened to the public as part of the revitalization plan.  The defense departments Base Realignment Commission initiatives resulted in major changes at Andrews Air Force Base with hundreds of new employment positions anticipated over the coming decades.\nIn 2006, multi-million-dollar federal renovations of the U.S. Census Building and National Oceanic and Atmospheric headquarters were completed. On October 1, 2009, Andrews Air Force Base, along with Naval Air Facility Washington, became a joint base known as Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility Washington, or Joint Base Andrews. Renovations were completed at the Spauldings Branch Library in 2012, which while located in District Heights, MD also serves Suitland and surrounding communities.\nRecent developments in Suitland include a double-digit fall in crime rates and increased development in the surrounding county. These include National Harbor to the south, Konterra to the north, Joint Base Andrews to the east of town, and the continuing development and/or gentrification of southeast Washington D.C. to the west. Several currently under-utilized Metro Stations in or around Suitland promise further development, as does recent legislation permitting gaming/casinos to be located in National Harbor. Two more revitalization projects were announced to the public in 2012: the \"Buy Suitland\" initiative and the Green Suitland Neighborhood Stabilization Project.\nThe \"Buy Suitland\" initiative offers up to 5% purchase price to first time home buyers, up to 7% purchase price to local civic workers, or 35% of purchase price or $40,000 to debt-to-income candidates for properties located in 11 census tracts. Green Suitland NSP is allocating over $2 million for the purchase of foreclosed and abandoned homes to be rehabilitated with enviro-friendly, cost-saving upgrades before they are resold.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAs an unincorporated area, Suitland's boundaries are not officially defined.  The U.S. Geological Survey locates the center of Suitland at 38\u00b050'49\"N 76\u00b055'33\"W.  This area is roughly bounded by Southern Avenue (D.C. Line) to the north, Branch Avenue (MD 5) to the west, Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) to the east, and Donnell Drive/Suitland Parkway/Meadowbrook Drive (Henson Creek) to the south. Within the northeastern section of these boundaries lies the township of Morningside, MD and a small portion of another unincorporated area known as Forestville, MD.According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Suitland has a total area of 4.2 square miles (11.0 km2), a 25% reduction from the 2.2 square miles (5.6 km2) used in previous years.  While the Census Bureau defines the CDP as all land, the Suitland Bog and portions of Henson Creek, a tributary of the Potomac, are located off Suitland Parkway near the southern border of the CDP.\nSuitland Bog is one of the last of the natural bogs in the D.C. region, which numbered approximately thirty before the onset of suburban development. This wetland ecosystem features sweet bay magnolias and other rare species of plants, including northern pitcher-plants, lady slipper orchids, sundews, and sphagnum moss.\n\n\n=== Parks and recreation ===\nThere are two community recreation centers (Bradbury Heights Recreation Center and William Beanes Community Center) and 4 parks (Auth Village Neighborhood Park, Douglas Patterson Community Park, Dupont Heights Neighborhood Park, and Michael J. Polley Neighborhood Park) maintained by the Prince George's County Department of Parks and Recreation.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nFor the 2010 Census the boundaries of the Suitland CDP were changed reducing the land area by approx. 25%. As a result, the population count for 2010 shows a 22.9% decrease, with a population density increase of 4%.\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 25,825 people and 10,139 households residing in the Suitland CDP.

The average household size was 2.53 and the average family size was 3.19.\nIn the census area, the population was spread out, with 23.9% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 30.5% from 25 to 44, 17.5% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30.5 years.\nThe median income for a household in the census area was $56,217, and the median income for a family was $61.393.  The per capita income for the area was $26,040. 7.4% (+/- 2.0%) of the population and 6.5% (+/-2.4%) of families were below the poverty line.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nThe major roads in Suitland are mostly two and three-lane highways. Suitland Parkway runs through the entirety of the Suitland CDP, and the Capital Beltway can be accessed from Pennsylvania Avenue (MD 4) and Branch Avenue (MD 5).\nThe community is served by the Washington Metro Naylor Road, Suitland and Branch Avenue stations (on the Green Line), respectively located at the intersections of Naylor Road and Branch Avenue, Silver Hill Road and Suitland Parkway then terminating between Auth Way and Capital Gateway Drive just off Branch Avenue and Auth Road.\n\n\n=== Major highways ===\n Interstate 95 enters the county at Laurel. It joins with Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) in College Park where it continues and leaves at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River.\n Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway) enters the county near Adelphi, and joins Interstate 95 at the College Park Interchange here it continues and leaves at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge over the Potomac River.\n Maryland Route 4, also called Pennsylvania Avenue, runs from the Maryland\u2013D.C. border eastward into Anne Arundel County and south in Calvert County.\n Maryland Route 5, also called Branch Avenue, runs from the Maryland\u2013D.C. border southeast through Charles County into St. Mary's County.\n Maryland Route 458, also called Silver Hill Road, runs from Branch Avenue northeast to Walker Mill Road in District Heights\n Maryland Route 218, also called Suitland Road, runs from the Maryland\u2013D.C. border east across Maryland Route 458 terminating at the front gate of Joint Base Andrews on Allentown Road.\n\n\n== Government ==\nPrince George's County Police Department District 3 Station in Landover CDP and District 4 Station in Glassmanor CDP, with an Oxon Hill postal address, serve the community.The U.S. Postal Service operates the Suitland Post Office in the CDP.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nSuitland is served by the county-wide public school system, Prince George's County Public Schools.Elementary schools serving sections of Suitland include Suitland, William Beanes, Samuel P.

    "Egypt\u2013Tunisia relations": "Egyptian\u2013Tunisian relations is the long, historical and cordial relationship between Egypt and Tunisia, two North African Arab countries.\n\n\n== Antiquity to medieval relations ==\nEgypt and Tunisia were homes of two of the earliest and oldest civilizations in Africa, the Egyptian civilization and Carthaginian civilization. Being two ancient countries, trades between Carthage and Ptolemaic Kingdom was extremely abundant, if not say, good and extensive. Nonetheless, rivalry existed between two countries, as the Egyptians didn't trust the Carthaginians and sometimes turned against the Carthaginians, making it complicated. This complicated nature between two nations would maintain until the end of antiquity and beginning of medieval eras.War elephants of Hannibal were thought to have traced from the Egyptians, many took parts on Hannibal's failed attempts to conquer Rome.Both Egypt and Tunisia were together fallen to various empires later, the Roman Empire, the Arab Caliphates and Ottoman Empire.  The most influential among all were the conquests led by Arabs on two countries, in which two nations adopted the Arabic language instead of their ancient languages, and the arrival of Islam. The influence of Islam and Arab also caused significant remarks, with some of the oldest ongoing institutions located in two countries, notably Al-Azhar University in Egypt and Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia.\nWith the Ottoman conquest, Egypt and Tunisia were together placed under the Turks, but Ottoman rule in two diverged by differences. Ottoman Egypt and Ottoman Tunisia both functioned as autonomous provinces of the empire, but relationship were remarkedly different. The Tunisians, in majority, remained loyal to the Ottoman state, and had been one of the earliest regions to support the Tanzimat, including abolishment of slavery which was one of the earliest in the world, at 1846, and was even among some of the most liberal parts of the empire; but the Egyptians had a number of conflicts with the Turks, dating back to the Ottoman\u2013Mamluk Wars, and even later Egyptian\u2013Ottoman Wars; while at the same time, Egypt used to support the Ottomans in various Ottoman wars. This backlash of relations between Egypt to the Ottoman Empire further developed with its own different view that would eventually escalate into 20th century under Gamal Abdel Nasser. Overall, Tunisia's relations with the Ottomans were deemed as good while Egypt's relations with the Ottomans were mostly complicated.\nIn late 19th century, both Egypt and Tunisia fell to the hand of European colonizers, the British Empire and France. Both were heavily modernized and effectively became some of the most liberal Arab countries, but its treatments varied. However, anti-British and anti-French activities in Egypt and Tunisia were so great that it pushed the British and French to re-decide their positions over its colonies. Both countries suffered much at the World War II, being targeted by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy; and also the turning points of the war started in both nations, notably the North African Campaign.\n\n\n== Modern relations ==\nWith Tunisia became independence at 1956, Egypt and Tunisia established relations thanked for the efforts by Habib Bourguiba, who used to study in Egypt previously. Egypt and Tunisia maintained cordial relationship, with Egypt and Tunisia were in common front against Israel. However, after Anwar Sadat signed the Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty at 1973, relationship between two soured, though not directly, as Tunisia had refrained from engaging against Israel unlike Egypt prior to Sadat. It was not until late 1980s that saw Egypt and Tunisia restored tie, but Tunisia was able to maintain low-key relations with Egypt.\nIn 1985, Israel launched Operation Wooden Leg, attacking Palestine Liberation Organization headquarter in Tunis, prompted angers from Tunisians. Egypt was one of these nations to condemn the attack, helped warming relations. After the end of Cold War, Egypt and Tunisia re-approached and became strategic partnership.\n\n\n=== Arab Spring ===\nThe outbreak of the Arab Spring drew strong support from both Tunisians and Egyptians alike, since they were the two earliest Arab nations to be influenced by the revolution. Despite this however, only Tunisia was more successful in transforming into democracy; Egypt, on the other hand, saw a second change of regime and even more unrest, although it was able to fully avoid civil war unlike Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.Despite the Spring, the two countries remain unsolved over its social issues. Radicalization of young people and Islamists alike, along with unstable economic conditions, have led to the two countries remaining corrupt even after the Spring.\n\n\n== Cooperation ==\nIn 2019, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced strengthening of relations and anti-terrorism with Tunisia. Previously, two countries also signed 10 cooperation agreements in 2017. It was expected, in 2017, that the trade relationship between two would have a boost.There are educational exchanges between Egypt and Tunisia in many fronts.\n\n\n== Diplomatic missions ==\nEgypt has an embassy in Tunis.\nTunisia has an embassy in Cairo.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nEgypt-Tunisia relations\nA comparative historical analysis of the Ulama and the state in Egypt and Tunisia",

    "Access to public information in North Macedonia": "Access to public information and freedom of information (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as \"right to know\". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.Access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution of North Macedonia (Article 16). To implement this constitutional right, the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia in January 2006 adopted the Law on Free Access to Public Information defining the procedures for exercising this right. The Law has been significantly amended at the beginning of 2010. According to a research carried out by the Centre for Law and Democracy, Macedonia is in the high 14th place on the world ranking list of states having the most functional law on free access to public information, despite the fact that this right has been introduced into Macedonian legal system in a relatively recent period. However, according to the European Commission, the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.\n\n\n== FOI provisions under the law ==\nThe Law on Free Access to Information stresses the obligation of the institutions to provide information with precise deadlines: it allows individuals and legal entities to exercise their right of access to public information and obliges the holders of information to provide information to the public.The public authorities subject to the law are governmental institutions and other bodies and institutions set by law, municipal bodies, public institutions and services, public enterprises and natural persons and legal entities performing a public service. In general, all information available to the public authorities holding the information is public. Access to them may be refused in exceptional cases determined by law.The holders of information are obliged to keep records and to update the list of information in their disposal and to publish them in a manner available to the public. Also, they are obliged to provide premises for inspection of the requested information.All institutions subject to the law are required to appoint officials for handling access to information requests. They are the reference point for the citizens willing to exercise their right to access public information. The holder of the information is obliged to inform the public on the official person responsible for mediating information. The appointed person for mediating information shall provide the necessary information, help the applicant and keep special records for receipt of the applications for information.Applicants can submit the requests in writing or orally. Reviewing the documents at the institution's building is free of charge. Costs of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents can be charged to the applicant. A decision on the request should be made within 30 days. Access to information can be refused if it threatens national or public security; the economy; the environment; commercial or private legitimate interests; monetary and exchange policies; or if interferes with the prevention of criminal offences.The Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information (KOMSPI) is in charge for providing information to the citizens regarding access to information, monitoring the implementation of the  law and delivering regular annual reports on the application of the Law to the Parliament. Also, the Commission conducts seminars and trainings aiming at educating public officials in their duties to implement the access to public information law. According to the 2015 European Commission Progress Report 2015 the Commission does not have sufficient capacity to monitor compliance with proactive disclosure of information, and has not the power to impose sanctions to better enforce the legislation.The applicant has the right to appeal against a refusal. The first complaint is to the Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information; in case the applicant is not satisfied with the decision, he/she can launch a judicial review.\n\n\n== Access to public information in practice ==\nDespite the good legal framework, the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective. Penalties are not imposed for failure to comply. Political parties are excluded from the list of holders of information, thus they are outside the scope of the law.According to journalists, there is a tendency by public authorities to over-use the \"classification\" of documents to prevent public access to information. According to Freedom House, the law is unevenly and selectively enforced, with official denying responses and shunning independent or critical media outlets.To monitor and test the implementation of the law, in 2012 the Macedonian Young Lawyers Association (MYLA) submitted 145 requests for free access to information of public interest to a number of state institutions. More than two thirds of the information holders responded within the legal time limit and delivered the requested information. However, some problems of implementation and difficulties emerged, such as the practice of redirecting the requests towards other state institutions, instead of delivering it.According to a survey conducted in 2013 by the Foundation Open Society - Macedonia, a significant share of Macedonian citizens does not believe they are entitled to have the right of access to public information and request informations of public interest. According to the survey, more than half of citizens had never heard and were unaware of the Law on Free Access to Public Information; only 13% of them were well knowledgeable about the Law.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccess to public information in Europe\nFreedom of information\nFreedom of information laws by country\nTransparency of media ownership in Europe\nMedia of the Republic of Macedonia\nTransparency of media ownership in the Republic of Macedonia\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Tungsten trioxide": "Tungsten(VI) oxide, also known as tungsten trioxide or tungstic anhydride, WO3, is a chemical compound containing oxygen and the transition metal tungsten. It is obtained as an intermediate in the recovery of tungsten from its minerals. Tungsten ores are treated with alkalis to produce WO3. Further reaction with carbon or hydrogen gas reduces tungsten trioxide to the pure metal.\n2 WO3 + 3 C \u2192 2 W + 3 CO2  (high temperature)\nWO3 + 3 H2 \u2192 W + 3 H2O  (550 - 850 \u00b0C)Tungsten(VI) oxide occurs naturally in the form of hydrates, which include minerals: tungstite WO3\u00b7H2O, meymacite WO3\u00b72H2O and hydrotungstite (of the same composition as meymacite, however sometimes written as H2WO4). These minerals are rare to very rare secondary tungsten minerals.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1841, a chemist named Robert Oxland gave the first procedures for preparing tungsten trioxide and sodium tungstate. He was granted patents for his work soon after, and is considered to be the founder of systematic tungsten chemistry.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\nTungsten trioxide can be prepared in several different ways.

It is tetragonal at temperatures above 740 \u00b0C, orthorhombic from 330 to 740 \u00b0C, monoclinic from 17 to 330 \u00b0C, triclinic from -50 to 17 \u00b0C, and monoclinic again at temperatures below -50 \u00b0C. The most common structure of WO3 is monoclinic with space group P21/n.Tungsten trioxide is a strong oxidizing agent: it reacts with rare-earth elements, iron, copper, aluminium, manganese, zinc, chromium, molybdenum, carbon, hydrogen and silver, being reduced to pure tungsten metal. Reaction with gold and platinum reduces it to the dioxide.\nWO3 + 2 Fe \u2192 W + Fe2O3\n2WO3 + Pt \u2192 2 WO2 + PtO2\n\n\n== Uses ==\nTungsten trioxide is used for many purposes in everyday life. It is frequently used in industry to manufacture tungstates for x-ray screen phosphors, for fireproofing fabrics and in gas sensors. Due to its rich yellow color, WO3 is also used as a pigment in ceramics and paints.In recent years, tungsten trioxide has been employed in the production of electrochromic windows, or smart windows. These windows are electrically switchable glass that change light transmission properties with an applied voltage. This allows the user to tint their windows, changing the amount of heat or light passing through.\n2010- AIST reports a quantum yield of 19% in photocatalytic water splitting with a caesium-enhanced tungsten oxide photocatalyst.In 2013, highly photocatalytic active titania/tungsten (VI) oxide/noble metal (Au and Pt) composites toward oxalic acid were obtained by the means of selective noble metal photodeposition on the desired oxide's surface (either on TiO2 or on WO3). The composite showed a modest hydrogen production performance.In 2016, shape controlled tungsten trioxide semiconductors were obtained by the means of hydrothermal synthesis. From these semiconductors composite systems were prepared with commercial TiO2. These composite systems showed a higher photocatalysis activity than the commercial TiO2 (Evonik Aeroxide P25) towards phenol and methyl orange degradation.In 1999, Reich and Tsabba propose a possible nucleation of superconducting regions with Tc = 90 K on the surface of Na-doped WO3 crystals. It would be the only superconducting material containing no copper, with Tc higher than the boiling point of liquid nitrogen at normal pressure. Later, it was reported results of the search for the possible superconducting state in tungsten oxides WO3\u2212x  with various oxygen deficiency 0 < x < 1. In samples with one particular composition WO2.9, the signatures of superconductivity with the transition temperature Tc  = 80 K   was observed in the magnetization measurements.Recently, some research groups have demonstrated that non-metal surface such as transition metal oxides (WO3, TiO2, Cu2O, MoO3, and ZnO etc.) could serve as a potential candidate for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy substrates and their performance could be comparable or even higher than those of commonly used noble-metal elements. There are two basic mechanisms for this application. One is that the Raman signal enhancement was tuned by charge transfer between the dye molecules and the substrate WO3 materials. The other is to use the electrical tuning of the defect density in the WO3 materials by the oxide leakage current control in order to modulate the enhancement factor of the SERS effect.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInternational Tungsten Industry Association\nPreparation of tungsten trioxide electrochromic films\nSigma Aldrich (supplier)",
    "Russian submarine Severodvinsk (K-560)": "K-560 Severodvinsk is a Yasen class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarine of the Russian Navy, and the lead vessel of the class. The submarine is named after the city of Severodvinsk.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe construction of the submarine started in 1993 and was first planned to be launched in 1998. However budgetary problems delayed the construction for years, and it was only launched on 15 June 2010. Severodvinsk began its sea trials on 12 September 2011 and it returned from the first voyage by 6 October 2011.On 7 November 2012, Severodvinsk successfully launched a Kalibr cruise missile (anti-ship version) from submerged position at a sea target in the White Sea. Later that month, the submarine successfully test fired two additional Kalibr cruise missiles (land attack version). The launches occurred on 26 November 2012 from a surfaced position and two days later from a submerged position.Severodvinsk was handed over to the Russian Navy in late December 2013. The flag-raising ceremony was held on 17 June 2014, marking its introduction into the Russian Navy.In November 2014, the submarine successfully tested its rescue capsule which surfaced from a depth of 40 metres (130 ft) with five crew members inside.Severodvinsk became combat-ready in early 2016. At the end of April 2016 and in August 2017, it conducted drills using 3M14 cruise missiles.On 28 March 2019, it has launched a Kalibr cruise missile from a pier at its homebase. Previously, such launches were not possible. The submarine has again launched Kalibr cruise missile during Grom-2019 strategic nuclear exercise on 17 October 2019.In Autumn 2019, she reportedly participated in the largest post-Cold War Russian submarine drills. The drills, sometimes dubbed as operation, included ten submarines, among them two diesel-electric and eight nuclear. The eight nuclear submarines was Northern Fleet's entire available non-strategic nuclear submarine fleet at the moment. The operation was supposedly testing Russian ability to breach the GIUK gap undetected and sail into the Atlantic Ocean, much like the operations Aport and Atrina in 1985 and 1987, respectively, when the Soviets deployed several SSNs near the U.S. coast before Gorbachev-Reagan meeting. This time, the operation started a week before Commander of the Russian Northern Fleet Aleksandr Moiseyev and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met their Norwegian counterparts in Kirkenes, Norway. The operation was expected to last up to two months.According to RF Defense Ministry sources, in late 2019 Severodvinsk trained submerging, surfacing and cruise missile fire in the Arctic.On 5 February 2021, she successfully hit a coastal target in Chiza training ground, Arkhangelsk Oblast with a Kalibr missile. In October 2021, the submarine was reported to have carried out a successful launch of the hypersonic Tsirkon missile from the White Sea at a target in the Barents Sea.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Julia Vargas Avenue": "Julia Vargas Avenue is a central east\u2013west arterial road that passes through Ortigas Center in Metro Manila, Philippines. It is a four-lane divided road with one-way protected bike lanes that runs parallel to Ortigas Avenue to the north and Shaw Boulevard to the south. The avenue stretches 2.3 kilometers (1.4 mi) from Eulogio Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5 Road) in Ugong, Pasig in the east to Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Wack-Wack Greenhills, Mandaluyong in the west. \nIt was named for philanthropist Do\u00f1a Julia Vargas y Camus vda. de Ortigas, wife of Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership founder Don Francisco Ortigas y Barcinas who owned the Hacienda de Mandaloyon estate on which Ortigas Center was built.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Carpool lanes ===\nThe road was previously a six-lane divided avenue with no bike lanes until 2018, when an experimental road diet was implemented, changing the corridor into a widened four-lane (two lanes per direction) divided avenue with one-way bike lanes with bollards. On each direction, one lane acted as a carpool lane for at least four passengers per vehicle, while the other was designated as a non-carpool lane.This traffic scheme has since been rescinded due to it being confusing for motorists. Despite this, the lane markings remain, with vehicle traffic during rush hours largely ignoring the lane markings, informally reverting the avenue back into its six-lane (four lane per direction) state.\n\n\n=== Motorcycle and bike lanes ===\nIn March 2021, Pasig mayor Vico Sotto announced that the avenue will undergo another road diet, shrinking the two car lanes, and adding a motorcycle lane parallel to the bike lane. The bike lane will also be physically separated by plant boxes.\n\n\n== Intersections ==\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\nJulia Vargas Avenue originates at an intersection with C-5 Road, also known as E. Rodriguez, Jr. Avenue, where SM Center Pasig is located. It heads west across Valle Verde passing the Silver City Auto Mall and Valle Verde 5 and 2 Village gates. Between the next intersection at Lanuza Avenue and City Golf, Vargas serves as the boundary between Valle Verde 3 and 4 villages. It passes the Ortigas Home Depot, a Sitel call center building, and a row of bars on the northern side before it comes to an intersection with Meralco Avenue and the Meralco flyover. \nWest of Meralco Avenue, the avenue officially enters the Ortigas Center business district. It passes the office towers of San Antonio, Pasig toward the border with Barangay Wack-Wack Greenhills, Mandaluyong at the intersection with ADB Avenue and San Miguel Avenue where the El Pueblo Real de Manila strip mall is located. This span of Julia Vargas Avenue onwards used to contain one-way unprotected bike lanes, which has since become faded.\nThe Ortigas Walkways Project, a series of elevated pedestrian walkways, covers the span of Julia Vargas Avenue within San Antonio.From ADB and San Miguel to its western terminus at EDSA, Vargas is one-way westbound only, with the left side of the road only allowing left turns to St. Francis Street, while the right side of the road continues as a service road and allows right turns to Bank Drive. Here, at the western edge of Ortigas Center, is St. Francis Square Mall, San Miguel Corporation Headquarters, and SM Megamall, where the avenue ends at EDSA.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nAntel Global Corporate Center\nIntegrated Bar of the Philippines\nMetrobank Ortigas Center\nThe Centerpoint Ortigas\nThe Currency Ortigas\nCity Golf\nEl Pueblo\nOne Corporate Center\nCW Home Depot\nSan Miguel Corporation Headquarters\nSt. Francis Square Mall\nSitel\nSM Center Pasig\nSM Megamall\nThe Podium\nValle Verde\nOrtigas East\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Igor Vovchanchyn": "Igor Yaroslavovych Vovchanchyn (vov-CHUN-chin, Ukrainian: \u0406\u0433\u043e\u0440 \u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043d; born August 6, 1973) is a retired Ukrainian mixed martial artist and kickboxer, who competed in early no holds barred MMA contests. After making his professional MMA debut in 1995, he won nine openweight mixed martial arts tournaments (back when tournament format required 3 to 4 consecutive bare-knuckle fights during the same night), 3 superfights, holds the second longest unbeaten streak in MMA (at 37 fights,) and is the second most successful MMA fighter ever by number of wins achieved by way of knockout. A stand-up striker throughout most of his career, he is widely considered one of the MMA legends, Ukrainian authorities created a MMA tournament named after him, the Igor Vovchanchyn Cup.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nVovchanchyn was born in the settlement of Fesky, in the Zolochevsky district to his father Yaroslav Iosifovich and his mother Kladiya Michaylovna. Vovchanchyn said that growing up, he caused trouble and got into street fights and different kinds of mischief. Due to his antics, there was a popular story in circulation, that whenever Igor became upset, the villagers would ring a bell in the center of town which would alarm everyone to stay in their houses until Igor calmed down. Vovchanchyn later stated that this story was just a joke, although there was a bell in the center of town. At age 17, he moved to Kharkiv and began competing in track and field, running the 100m dash and throwing the discus. Due to his love for fighting, he later moved to boxing under trainer Oleg Ermakov. In 1993, he met Eugenia Borschevskaya, general secretary of the All Eurasian Kickboxing Federation. After taking up kickboxing, he later went to Denmark to compete at the World Kickboxing Amateur Championships with the Ukrainian national team, where he became the world champion that same year. Vovchanchyn also won the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) kickboxing championship in 1994.\n\n\n== Mixed martial arts career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\n\n==== Honour of the Warrior ====\nIn late 1995, Vovchanchyn transitioned from a successful kickboxing career to MMA after being invited to participate at Honour of the Warrior in Kharkiv, Ukraine. In this 8-man tournament, Vovchanchyn knocked out his first two opponents before losing via submission to Ukrainian Sambist Andrey Besedin in the final.\n\n\n==== International Absolute Fighting Council ====\nHe then fought a month later in a 32-man tournament, performing impressively at the inaugural International Absolute Fighting Council event in Russia, where he TKO'd Sergei Akinen before defeating Adilson Lima, a Gracie Jiu Jitsu black belt who trained with Ryan Gracie. Vovchanchyn won by knockout via soccer kick 56 seconds into the fight, but Lima's cornerman (Renzo Gracie) argued to the tournament organisers, complaining that kicks to a downed opponent were unfair and demanded an instant rematch. Unusually, an immediate rematch was granted, and the fight began again only to be stopped a second time after Lima's nose was broken by a punch, giving Vovchanchyn the win by TKO. Vovchanchyn would advance to the quarterfinal, where he would be finally submitted by Russian sambo champion Mikhail Ilyukhin.\n\n\n==== Mr. Strongman SEKAI ====\n\nWith his dominant kickboxing style, he became famed for being one of the few strictly stand-up fighters to overcome grappling-based opponents, exemplified in his victory in the 8-man Mr. Strongman Sekai tournament in Minsk, Belarus on January 23, 1996.\n\n\n==== March 1996 ====\nIn March 1996, Vovchanchyn fought in and won 3 different tournaments: the \nDNRF: Ukrainian Octagon, the UCMAL: Ukrainian No Rules Championship, and the first ever IFC event: IFC 1: Kombat in Kyiv. Across these three tournaments, he won 9 fights (7 KO/TKO's and 2 submissions) with none of them going past the first round. At the IFC tournament, all three men he faced in the same night (Fred Floyd, Paul Varelans and John Dixon) weighed over 300 pounds/136 kilograms. The fight against Paul Varelans was considered one of the greatest fights in European MMA history. In attendance at this event, was former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spinks, who was a 'guest of honor'.\n\n\n==== UFC Invitation ====\nVovchanchyn was invited to fight at UFC 11 in September 1996, but could not participate due to visa issues as well as dissatisfaction with the offer.\n\n\n==== World Vale Tudo Championship ====\nHaving achieved much success across Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and even winning a tournament in Israel - winning 7 tournaments in total - Vovchanchyn competed in the World Vale Tudo Championship in Brazil. He won all 3 fights in one night via KO/TKO, including a brutal 14-second knockout in the final over Nick Nutter, an NCAA All-American Wrestler from Ohio State (and a teammate of Mark Coleman).Vovchanchyn won eight MMA tournaments during this stage of his career, and was considered arguably the best heavyweight in the world for several years to come.\n\n\n=== PRIDE FC ===\n\n\n==== Early PRIDE career ====\nAfter winning at World Vale Tudo Championship 5, Vovchanchyn was invited to Japanese promotion PRIDE, fighting Gary Goodridge in his debut. Vovchanchyn was taken down twice by the larger Goodridge and was left behind on points, but he dominated Goodridge during the stand-up exchanges and knocked him out with two left hooks, 5:58 into the first round.\nVovchanchyn returned to the World Vale Tudo Championship, winning two superfights against Aloisio Freitas Neto and Edson Carvalho.\nOnce again in PRIDE, Vovchanchyn then fought Japanese fighter Akira Shoji. Most of the fight stayed in the standing position, with Vovchanchyn damaging a wary Shoji and throwing him down, while the Japanese circled him and lied on the mat to avoid his hits. At the end Vovchanchyn won the judges decision by damaging Shoji badly with strikes.\nIn what was Vovchanchyn's last venture for some time outside of PRIDE, he participated in another 4-man tournament called 'InterPride' in his home country of Ukraine, winning the first fight via TKO and the final by submission.\nComing back to PRIDE, he fought Carlos \"Carl\u00e3o\" Barreto, a Carlson Gracie team member and reigning IVC Heavyweight Champion. Despite the larger height of Barreto, Vovchanchyn countered him with punches and leg kicks and shut down his takedown attempts for the first two rounds, but action was slow and often saw Barreto as the most active fighter. Come the overtime, they traded hits and Barreto managed to take Igor down, ending the fight working ground and pound on him. The decision was given to Vovchanchyn, which was met with a certain controversy.After the Barreto match, Vovchanchyn made a special appearance in K-1 for a kickboxing rules match, facing multiple champion and established star Ernesto Hoost. The format impaired Igor, who often found himself going for takedowns, while Hoost kept attacking his left leg with low kicks. At the end, the Ukrainian fighter fell down thrice due to the damage to his leg, which cost him the match by knockout.\nAt Pride 7, Vovchanchyn faced Mark Kerr in a highly anticipated bout.  Vovchanchyn knocked out Kerr with a knee to the head from a north-south position.  Later, the fight was ruled a \"no-contest\", as knee strikes to the head of a grounded opponent was illegal.\n\n\n===== Unofficial #1 Heavyweight Superfight =====\nVovchanchyn was next matched up with American wrestler Mark Kerr for the unofficial title of #1 heavyweight in the world. Nearly all outlets that covered mixed martial arts considered either Igor or the unbeaten two-time UFC Champion and ADCC Champion Mark Kerr as the best heavyweight and pound for pound fighter in the world. Early in the fight, Kerr cut Vovchanchyn with a knee strike to the right eye and secured several takedowns, but he was unable to pass Igor's guard or do any more significant damage. In the last round, Vovchanchyn pounced on the now-exhausted Kerr and dominated him with strikes, eventually knocking him out with a series of knees. Igor was declared the winner, but the result was later overturned and the result declared a no contest. Knees to the head of a grounded opponent in the four points position had been banned just prior to the event. This fight was also the first time Vovchanchyn's manager, Eugenia Borschevskaya, was seen in his corner.\n\n\n===== Bueno Knockout =====\nIn his next fight, Vovchanchyn fought Brazilian jiu-jitsu master Francisco Bueno. Igor knocked Bueno out with a vicious combination, Bueno literally falling face first as he was being punched in the face. This knockout is still to this day considered one of the most brutal knockouts in the history of MMA - it even prompted the promoters of K-1 to give him $1,000 cash in the locker room and propose that he fought K-1 Champion Ernesto Hoost. After this string of victories, Vovchanchyn became a huge favorite going into the Pride Grand Prix 2000.\n\n\n==== PRIDE Openweight Grand Prix 2000 ====\nVovchanchyn had been considered the top fighter in the sport for some years, and as commentators Stephen Quadros and Bas Rutten stated, he was likely the favorite to win the tournament. In the opening round he defeated Japanese professional wrestler Alexander Otsuka by decision and, in a rematch with Gary Goodridge, decisively won by knockout in an entirely stand-up fight.  He reached the final of the PRIDE 2000 Openweight Grand Prix.\nVovchanchyn then faced the number one pound for pound fighter in the world, Kazushi Sakuraba of Japan, who had beaten Royce Gracie earlier that night in a 90-minute bout, the longest in recent competitive fighting history. Though Sakuraba took him down and punched him, Vovchanchyn eventually grabbed a waist lock takedown and controlled the Japanese with strikes while Sakuraba covered up. After the fight was declared a draw and needed a second round to determine a finalist, Sakuraba's corner threw in the towel as he had just fought for 105 minutes and could not physically continue. Vovchanchyn won the fight via TKO (corner stoppage) and advanced to the last round.\nVovchanchyn met powerhouse American wrestler Mark Coleman in the final. Coleman had the advantage, coming into the final match, as he bypassed the semi finals after his opponent, Kazuyuki Fujita, retired due to injury. Coleman kept the visibly tired Igor on the ground, and during the second 20-minute round, finished the fight by gaining a north-south position and repeatedly kneed Vovchanchyn the head, forcing Vovchanchyn to tap out. Igor later said that Coleman was the toughest opponent he faced up to that point.\n\n\n==== Post Grand Prix ====\nFacing Japanese gatekeeper Daijiro Matsui at PRIDE 9, Vovchanchyn controlled the bout by sprawling and performing ground and pound on him, until the fight was stopped by eye damage on Matsui.\nIgor then fought Enson Inoue at PRIDE 10 in what was one of the most one sided fights in MMA history, which resulted in a doctor stoppage after the end of the 1st round. Inoue later recounted of the fight, \"I sustained a broken jaw, fractured finger, perforated eardrum, swollen brain, a liver count 2000x the normal person and spent 2 days in intensive care.\" Vovchanchyn then faced off against Nobuhiko Takada at PRIDE 11, who was the trainer of Sakuraba and Matsui. Vovchanchyn was taken down and met leg kicks and some resistance, but he finished him on the second round via ground and pound.\nAfter three straight victories, Vovchanchyn received a rematch with Mark Kerr at PRIDE 12. Vovchanchyn's advantage in the stand up fighting was countered by Kerr's superior grappling and takedowns, and the fight was ruled a draw after two rounds. After an extra, third round, Vovchanchyn was awarded the victory via unanimous decision. Igor cited both of his fights against Mark Kerr as the most difficult wins of his career.\n\n\n==== PRIDE decline ====\n\n\n===== 2001 =====\nAlthough he was scheduled to face Ken Shamrock at Pride 13, Vovchancyn faced Tra Telligman, as Shamrock had sustained a neck injury 2 weeks prior to the fight. Despite Igor being able to counterstrike, Telligman surprised him with a left straight which knocked Vovchanchyn down, allowing Tra control the rest of the fight and win the decision. This was the first time Igor had been outstruck, even if it was seen as an upset.\nHe later faced another feared striker, former RINGS Openweight champion Gilbert Yvel at PRIDE 14. However, sensing Gilbert was weaker than him on the ground, Vovchanchyn took him down, putting his sambo skills to use and choking Yvel out.\nVovchanchyn would go to defeat another striker, beating world karate champion Masaaki Satake by decision at PRIDE 15.\nIn PRIDE 17, Vovchanchyn suffered another upset when was submitted in under three minutes by Brazilian Top Team trainer Mario Sperry. After this bout, he was invited to fight at the RINGS promotion, in Lithuania. Vovchanchyn's original opponent pulled out of the event with an injury, and was replaced by a fighter who \"hadn't fought for quite a while\". This fighter requested that no punches be allowed in the fight, which Igor said was difficult to avoid, but won via leg kicks in the second round.He ended the year on a high note; showing great grappling expertise against Valentijn Overeem at PRIDE 18, escaping from heel hook attempts and slipping his own heel hook for the tap out, ending 2001 with a mixed record in PRIDE - going 3\u20132.\n\n\n===== 2002\u20132003 =====\nAt the start of 2002, Vovchanchyn considered moving down to the Middleweight (205lb) division, and stated he thought he had a good chance to become a champion in that weight class. This move did not happen, and he faced Heath Herring at PRIDE 19, struggling in a fight which saw both grappling and striking from the two men, but after Herring accidentally headbutted Vovchanchyn at the third round, he was controlled by him, and judges gave the decision to Heath. Fighting Quinton Jackson would be similarly unfortunate for Vovchanchyn, as the American fighter slammed him twice, getting him submitted due to injury at PRIDE 22.\nAfter beating Bob Schrijber by submission in a Dutch promotion, Vovchanchyn faced off against Mirko Cro Cop in August 2003. Igor was knocked out via left head kick. This fight is considered a 'passing of the torch', as Vovchanchyn had split his last 8 fights in Pride with a record of 3\u20135 (1\u20133 in his last 4), and it elevated the newer striking sensation Cro Cop into an Interim Heavyweight Championship fight with Ant\u00f4nio Rodrigo Nogueira.\n\n\n===== 2004 =====\nBreaking his losing streak at the start of 2004, Vovchanchyn defeated former King of the Cage Super Heavyweight champion Dan Bobish and was announced as one of the participants of PRIDE's upcoming 16-man heavyweight Grand Prix, but withdrew due to injury. Vovchanchyn went on to fight Katsuhisa Fujii at the end of the year.\n\n\n==== Drop to Middleweight (93 kg) ====\nIn 2005, Vovchanchyn moved down a weight division - beating former Pancrase Heavyweight champion Yoshiki Takahashi. Takahashi said after the fight, \"I've never been knocked out by a single punch until today, I'm still dizzy and have [a] headache.\" After this victory, he entered PRIDE's 2005 Middleweight Grand Prix. PRIDE commentator Bas Rutten believed that Vovchanchyn was a favorite to win the tournament.\n\n\n===== PRIDE Middleweight Grand Prix 2005 =====\nVovchanchyn was matched against Yuki Kondo - the reigning Pancrase Light Heavyweight champion and former two-time Pancrase Openweight champion - in PRIDE Total Elimination 2005. Vovchanchyn controlled the fight, winning a unanimous decision.\nHe then fought Alistair Overeem in the quarter finals and lost via submission. Vovchanchyn received a second chance to progress when offered a fight against Kazuhiro Nakamura in PRIDE Final Conflict 2005, with the winner earning the right to be an alternate in the finals of the tournament. After 15 minutes, Vovchanchyn lost a unanimous judges' decision in what would be his last competitive MMA fight.\nOn his move down to the Middlweight division, Vovchanchyn said, \"It's all about training. I was 93 kg only for the last two years in PRIDE when they introduced weight divisions. But actually my natural weight is around 103-104 kg. Losing weight I did't feel myself as strong as before. But 104 kg is the best weight for me and I am really comfortable about it. I felt strong, powerful, full of energy. Due to losing weight I felt lack of self-confidence. By the way the same goes for Fedor (Emelianenko), when he lost the weight, he felt out of his comfort zone. It's not about the shape and visual muscular performance but it was not his style.\" Regarding Vovchanchyn's weight, popular nutritionist Mike Dolce stated that he wished he could've helped Vovchanchyn drop to the 170 lb weight-class and make him the 'welterweight Fedor'. Some experts say that Vovchanchyn ideally should have fought at the Welterweight (183) division that PRIDE had, and that he was an undersized heavyweight.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nAlthough he was rumored to fight at PRIDE 34 against Wanderlei Silva, Vovchanchyn retired at age 32, citing multiple injuries, including a right hand that remained seriously affected as of 2008. It has been speculated that due to this injury, his last few performances in his career were passive. He finished his career in PRIDE with a record of 18\u20138 with 1 no contest, having the second most bouts in PRIDE history (27), second most wins in PRIDE history, and third most wins via KO/TKO (10). Vovchanchyn is considered one of MMA's hardest punchers, one of the best fighters in history to have never competed in the UFC, one of the greatest European mixed martial artists ever, and one of the best mixed martial artists of the 1990s. He was a top 10 heavyweight from April 1996 to January 2001 according to FightMatrix. In 2011 and in 2017, Vovchanchyn received several votes on Sherdog's 'MMA's All-Time Heavyweights' list.\n\n\n==== Potential return to MMA ====\n\n\n===== 2009 =====\nIn July 2009, Vovchanchyn was linked to making his return in MMA at the Fighting Mixed Combative event in South Korea, which was scheduled for September 29, 2009. Although Jan Nortje was rumored to be his opponent, Vovchanchyn had just stated one year prior that he had no interest in fighting due to his injuries. The event took place and Igor did not appear on the card.\n\n\n===== 2016 =====\nIn September 2016, Rizin Fighting Federation CEO Nobuyuki Sakakibara posted several photos on his Instagram account, showing Vovchanchyn training in his gym back in Ukraine - even hinting that he may invite Igor back to fight in Japan.\n\n\n== Fighting style ==\nPrimarily a kickboxer, Vovchanchyn based his MMA game around his punching power, which made him to be considered one of the most devastating strikers of his time. His boxing utilized an ample pattern of looping punches, among them the casting punch, and he specialized in an aggressive counterpunching style in order to make up for his short reach. Vovchanchyn also displayed significant grappling skills, utilizing his sambo background, and would work a vicious ground and pound offense with short and hard strikes from the top. He was able to surprise many with his defensive guard and dexterity on the ground despite being known primarily as a striker, and displayed this ability against submission fighters such as Carlos Barreto, Mark Kerr and Valentijn Overeem among others.Despite his small size, Vovchanchyn was known for his toughness and strength, leading Nobuhiko Takada to call him a \"strongman\". Vovchanchyn would later state that his punching power and fighting skills came naturally, not because of the martial arts, even though martial arts helped him along the way.\nHe also never invited any famous fighters to spar and train with him as he did not see the point in copying their styles.\nHe trained with many of the same coaches his entire career.\nVovchanchyn was known to take on any challenger, despite size or rules, even fighting in prison when he was not even a prisoner himself.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nVovchanchyn is married and has one daughter, named Zlata. He identifies himself as neither Russian or Ukrainian, but as a Slav. He is close friends with Fedor Emelianenko.\nIn a 2008 interview, Vovchanchyn stated that since retiring from competition he runs a local cafe-bar called 'Champion'.\n\n\n== Championships and accomplishments ==\n\n\n=== Mixed martial arts ===\nUkrainian Combat Martial Arts League\nHonour of the Warrior Runner-up (1995)\nUkrainian No Rules Championship Champion (1996)\nMr. Strongman SEKAI\nMr. Strongman SEKAI Champion (1996)\nDonetsk No Rules Fighting\nUkrainian Octagon Champion (1996)\nUkrainian Octagon 2 Champion (1996)\nInternational Fighting Championship\nInternational Fighting Championship 1 Champion (1996)\nInternational Absolute Fighting Council\n1st Absolute Fighting World Cup Pankration Champion (1997)\nAbsolute Fighting Championship 2 Superfight Champion (1997)\nAbsolute Fighting Russian Open Cup 3 Champion (1997)\nWorld Vale Tudo Championship\nWorld Vale Tudo Championship 5 Tournament Champion\nWVC 6 Super Fight Champion (one time)\nWVC 7 Super Fight Champion (one time)\nInterPride\nInterPride 1999: Heavyweight Final Champion (1999)\nPRIDE Fighting Championship\n2000 PRIDE Openweight Grand Prix Runner-Up\nSecond most bouts in PRIDE history (27)\nSecond most wins in PRIDE history (18)\nThird most wins via KO/TKO in PRIDE history (10)\n\n\n=== Kickboxing ===\n63 Fights, 61 Wins, 2 Losses\n\nWorld Kickboxing Amateur Championships Winner - Denmark (1993)\nCommonwealth of Independent States (CIS/USSR) Kickboxing Champion (1994)\n\n\n== Mixed martial arts record ==\n\n\n== Kickboxing record (Incomplete) ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfessional MMA record for Igor Vovchanchyn from Sherdog \nIgor Vovchanchyn profile at Pride FC official website\nIgor Vovchanchyn official website at the Wayback Machine (archive index)",

    "Paul Weller (album)": "Paul Weller is the eponymous debut solo album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Weller, released in 1992.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAfter disbanding The Style Council and leaving label Polydor in 1989, Weller formed The Paul Weller Movement in 1990, releasing a single, \"Into Tomorrow\", on his own Freedom High record label, in October 1991.  Its success - reaching #36 in the UK chart - led to Weller being offered a new record deal with Go! Discs.\nThe album represents something of a return to Weller's 'roots', with \"Into Tomorrow\" and \"Uh Huh Oh Yeh\" in particular being heavily influenced by 60s R&B. According to Weller, \"'Uh Huh Oh Yeh' \u2013 and, after it, the Stanley Road album \u2013 was me revisiting my roots. I hadn't been down to Woking in a long time. That was the first time, in the early '90s, when I was finding my feet again.\" The album as a whole retained some of the funk influences displayed by The Style Council, particularly on \"I Didn't Mean To Hurt You\" and \"Remember How We Started\". However, the explicit political leanings of The Style Council are abandoned, with the lyrical themes visited on the album being much more personal.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe album entered the UK Albums Chart on 12 September 1992, reaching number eight and staying on the chart for seven weeks.Before the UK edition of the album, it had already been released in Japan on 29 April 1992. The track listing differs from subsequent releases, and the running order is altered. The track \"New Thing\" (a different recording of \"Here's a New Thing\" from the \"Into Tomorrow\" single) was replaced by \"The Strange Museum\" on all other versions. Until 2009, \"New Thing\" was unique to this release.\nIn addition to \"Into Tomorrow\", included on the album, two further singles were released from the album - \"Uh Huh Oh Yeh\", on 15 August 1992, reaching #18, and \"Above The Clouds\" on 10 October 1992, reaching #47.\nA deluxe edition of the album was released on 26 October 2009 and reached #88 in the UK Album Chart.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nAll songs written by Paul Weller, except where noted.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nSteve White - Drums, Percussion\nJacko Peake - Saxophones, Flute, Backing Vocals\nPaul Weller - Guitar, Vocals, Bass (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11), Keyboards, Percussion\nDr. Robert - Bass (12), Backing Vocals (3,8)\n\"Brother\" Marco Nelson - Bass (9)\nDee C.

    "South Africa and the World Bank": "The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited is a major South African bank and financial services group. It is Africa's biggest lender by assets. The company's corporate headquarters, Standard Bank Centre, is situated in Simmonds Street, Johannesburg.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe bank now known as Standard Bank was formed in 1862 as a South African subsidiary of the British overseas bank Standard Bank, under the name The Standard Bank of South Africa.\nThe bank's origins can be traced to 1862, when a group of businessmen led by the prominent South African politician John Paterson formed a bank in London, initially under the name Standard Bank of British South Africa. The bank started operations in 1863 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and soon after opening it merged with several other banks including the Commercial Bank of Port Elizabeth, the Colesberg Bank, the British Kaffrarian Bank and the Fauresmith Bank.\nIt was prominent in financing and development of the diamond fields of Kimberley in 1867. The word \"British\" was dropped from the title in 1883.  When gold was discovered on the Witwatersrand, the bank expanded northwards and on 11 October 1886 the bank started doing business in a tent at Ferreira's Camp (later to be called Johannesburg), thus becoming the first bank to open a branch on the Witwatersrand gold fields. On 1 November 1901 a second branch was opened in Eloff Street of Johannesburg.\n\nUntil 1962 the British bank was formally known as the Standard Bank of South Africa, although by then its operations spread across Africa. When the South African operations were formed into a subsidiary in 1962, the parent changed its name to Standard Bank Limited, and the South African subsidiary took its parent's previous name.\nIn 1967 shares in the Standard Bank of South Africa were offered to the South African public, although the British parent company retained over 80% of the shares.The parent bank merged in 1969 with Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China and the combined bank became known as Standard Chartered Bank.  In 1969 the Standard Bank Investment Corporation (now Standard Bank Group) was established as the holding company of the South African bank.  During the 1970s and 1980s Standard Chartered gradually reduced its shareholding, and sold its remaining 39% stake in Standard Bank Group in 1987, transferring complete ownership of the holding company to South African investors and in particular Liberty Life (and its affiliates), with the latter being the company's major shareholder until 1999.In March 2019, Standard became the first bank in Africa to shift its operations onto Amazon Web Services.In March 2019, the bank announced a reduction of 91 branches and 1200 staff. The decision was taken due to a growing use of self-service channels and a branch network becoming less relevant.\n\n\n== Expansion and acquisitions ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\nIn 1992 the bank acquired the operations of ANZ Grindlays Bank in eight African countries.  Most of the newly acquired banks were renamed Stanbic Bank, to avoid confusion with the former parent (and now competitor), Standard Chartered, which continued to operate in Africa.  Several more banks in Africa were acquired during the 1990s, and adopted the Stanbic name. Standard Bank now trades under the name Stanbic Bank in Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\n\n\n==== Eswatini ====\nStandard Bank Eswatini opened its doors in 1988 and is today a leading commercial bank in the country.\n\n\n==== Ivory Coast ====\nIn February 2014, Standard Bank Group is expected to open a representative office in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, marking the entry of the banking conglomerate into Francophone West Africa. Ivory Coast becomes the 19th African country where Standard Bank maintains a subsidiary.\n\n\n==== Malawi ====\nIn December 2001, Standard Bank acquired 60.18% holding in the Commercial Bank of Malawi and became a majority shareholder.

The bank was established in Namibia by the first commercial branch on 19 August 1915 in L\u00fcderitz. It's one of the largest banks in Namibia and operates from more than 50 branches.\n\n\n==== Nigeria ====\nOn 21 August 2007 Standard Bank Group acquired controlling interest in IBTC Chartered Bank. founded by the merger of the International Banking & Trust Company Plc and Chartered Bank Plc. This gave subsidiary Stanbic IBTC Holdings significant presence in the Nigerian market.\n\n\n==== Tanzania ====\n\nIn 1995, the bank acquired the operations of the Meridien BIAO Bank and renamed it Stanbic Bank Tanzania Limited. In September 2012, Stanbic Bank Tanzania secured financing worth $3 billion for Mchuchuma Iron Ore and Liganga Coal mining project in the Ludewa district of the newly created region of Njombe in southwestern Tanzania.\n\n\n==== Uganda ====\nIn 2002, Standard Bank acquired 90% of Uganda Commercial Bank, the largest commercial bank in Uganda at that time, making Standard Bank a major actor in the banking sector of that East African country. They renamed the bank Stanbic Bank (Uganda) Limited. As of December 2012, Stanbic Bank (Uganda) was still Uganda's largest commercial bank with approximately 20% of all bank assets and about 18% of all bank branches in the country. The stock of Stanbic Bank (Uganda) Limited is traded on the Uganda Securities Exchange (USE) under the symbol SBU. Standard Bank Group maintains approximately 80% shareholding.In 2015 Stanbic Bank was involved in a fraud scandal involving money transfers from the Swedish embassy to private accounts of a former embassy employee.\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn the early 1990s the bank started operations in London, and Standard Bank London Ltd was awarded a banking licence in 1992.It was announced at the end of July 2013 that Standard Bank was in talks to sell its markets business in London to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for more than $500 million. In November 2013, Standard Bank confirmed it was in talks to sell a controlling stake in its London-based global markets business.In January 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) fined Standard Bank PLC (Standard Bank) \u00a37,640,400 for failings relating to its anti-money laundering (AML) policies and procedures over corporate customers connected to politically exposed persons (PEPs).\nBetween 15 December 2007 and 20 July 2011, Standard Bank failed to comply with Regulation 20(1) of the Money Laundering Regulations because it failed to take reasonable care to ensure that all aspects of its AML policies were applied appropriately and consistently to its corporate customers connected to PEPs.\n\n\n==== Argentina ====\nIn 2006, Standard Bank bought BankBoston Argentina unit expanding its operations into this country.\nIn 2012, ICBC acquired 80% of its shares.

[1]\n\n\n==== Jersey ====\nStandard Bank has operations in Jersey.\n\n\n==== Turkey ====\nAlso in August 2007, Standard Bank Group acquired a 67% share of the Turkish bank Dundas \u00dcnl\u00fc Securities and now operates in Turkey under the name of Standard \u00dcnl\u00fc. The Bank sold its shares down to 25% in April 2012 and the Turkish sub was renamed \u00dcNL\u00dc & Co. afterwards.\n\n\n==== Russia ====\nOn 6 March 2009, Standard Bank announced plans to acquire 33% of Russia's second biggest investment bank, Troika Dialog. Troika, which was Russia's oldest brokerage, acquired Standard Bank's Russian banking operation, and in addition received cash of $200-million in the form of a 'convertible loan'[2]. Two executives of Standard Bank joined Troika's six-member board.\nIn March 2011, Sberbank, number one bank in Russia by the size of capital and assets, bought Troika Dialog [3] and paid Standard Bank $372 million for its 36.4% stake in Troika.\n\n\n== Investments in Standard Bank ==\n\n\n=== Loan deal with Chinese banks ===\nOn 11 September 2009 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau), Bank of China, China Development Bank, China CITIC Bank initiated $1Billion club loan to Standard Bank.\n\n\n=== ICBC deal ===\nIn October 2007 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China acquired a stake of about 20% in Standard Bank for US$5.5bn.

    "Jules David (photographer)": "The photographer Jules David is not to be confused with the lithographer Jules David.Jules David, also Jules David-Cavaz (16 April 1848 \u2013 8 October 1923), was a French photographer. In France, he was one of the first professional photographers to specialize in school photography. With his specialty, he built up an international career, often returning to schools, institutions and companies that he had worked with previously. Based in Levallois-Perret near Paris, he worked throughout Europe, and beyond, for almost forty years, traveling as far as Norway, Russia, Greece and Brazil.\n\n\n== Life ==\nJules David-Cavaz was born the son of Jean David-Cavaz and Fran\u00e7oise Capitant in the hamlet of Charvin, near the village of Pinsot in the Is\u00e8re department of South-Eastern France. His parents were propri\u00e9taires, land-owning farmers, so his family was probably not entirely poor.Little is known about the first 20 years of his life. Nor do we know where he learned his photographic skills. In 1867, nineteen years old, he worked as an independent \"group photographer\" (photographe des groupes). In 1869 he was working with the photographer Claude Bretagne (1824\u20131880) in Leuven, Belgium. In 1870\u20131871 he served in the French army during the Franco-Prussian War. He left the army in August 1871 as a sergeant major.\nIn 1873 David opened, together with Bretagne, a photo studio at the rue Gravel 54 in Levallois-Perret. The studio advertised specifically with \"school photographs\" (photographies des \u00e9coles), whereby schools included secondary schools, boarding schools, teacher training colleges and military academies. The association with Bretagne ended after two or three years, in 1875 or 1876, after which David set up his own studio at the rue Gravel 50. Levallois-Perret was to remain his home base for the rest of his life. After a short stay at the rue Tr\u00e9zel 19, in 1879 he moved to rue des Courcelles 90. In 1897 he won a bronze medal at the Brussels International Exposition. From 1902 to 1910 he lived in the Rue Rivay in Levallois-Perret.On 8 October 1874 Jules David married Marie C\u00e9cile Mathilde Daman (1851-after 1923) in Leuven, Belgium, where his wife was born. It is not known whether the couple had any children. Some sources indicate that David became a wealthy man. After World War I he volunteered to pay for a monument commemorating the dead in his birthplace Pinsot. He also donated a large sum to the local school, which the pupils decided to devote to the rebuilding of the destroyed school in Manicamp, Northern France.David died, aged 75, on 8 October 1923, in his home in the rue Pr\u00e9sident Wilson 90. He was a recipient of the French M\u00e9daille militaire.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\nDavid's work differs from that of the numerous traveling photographers of the late 19th century. Photography was still a relatively new discipline and in some regions of Europe few photo studios existed. Travelling photographers filled the gap, advertising their services wherever they went. Generally, portrait photography was all they had on offer. This was not the case with Jules David who carefully prepared his travels and almost exclusively worked with clients who wanted more than a simple portrait. His preferred clients were educational institutions of the bourgeoisie, among them military schools and boarding schools, where French was often the language of instruction.\nAs a rule, he would take a series of photographs of the building and its interior, he would then prepare a number of carefully composed group portraits of teachers and students, often complemented with 'action' photographs of students taking classes or involved in leisure activities. He then finished the production in his studio in Levallois. The finished product, often a luxury album bound in linen or red leather with imprints in gold, was sent free of charge to the head of the institution after which directors, teachers, students or employees would choose the images they wanted a copy of.The demand for this type of photographs diminished towards the end of the century. There was more competition from local photographers who were able to provide schools with simpler \u2013 and thus cheaper \u2013 class photographs. The era of technical challenges and carefully prepared compositions was over. David ended his international career shortly after 1910, after which he exclusively worked in France. With his associate Edmond Vallois he ran a photo studio at the rue de Rennes in Paris. Many of his negatives on glass were sold to the then flourishing picture postcard industry, which after his retirement remained an important source of income for his successor Vallois.\n\n\n== Photographs ==\n\n\n=== France ===\nJules David worked in France as a photographer specialized in school photography from 1867 until around 1915. The majority of his clients were schools and Catholic institutions. Judging by the number of photographs of Paris sixth-form colleges (lyc\u00e9es), quite a few of them made use of his services. However, his reputation in France was not limited to 'school photography', as can be deducted from the prestigious commission to portray the French president Jules Gr\u00e9vy and his military staff in the garden of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. Other well-known people were photographed by David: a photograph of Gustave Eiffel with his wife and children shows them relaxing in their garden in Levallois-Perret. His work in France continued after 1875, even when increasingly spending time abroad.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Belgium and Netherlands ===\nThe first country outside France where David received commissions was Belgium. In 1874, while still associated with Claude Bretagne, he worked in Antwerp and Verviers. Perhaps not entirely accidental, one of his last recorded trips abroad in 1911 was also to Verviers. An important commission, possibly given to him by the bishop of Namur, mgr. Th\u00e9odore-Joseph Gravez, led in 1878 to the publication of the leather-bound album L'Episcopat Belge 1878, which included portraits of all Belgian bishops, their cathedrals and their episcopal palaces. He must have returned to the country at least fourteen times, each time taking commissions from more than one client.\nIn the Netherlands, professional school photography was introduced by Jules David in the school year 1879\u20131880. Between 1879 and 1908 he visited the country at least twenty times. As in France and Belgium, his main clients were Catholic institutions, notably Jesuit and Ursuline boarding schools. However, his best client in the Netherlands was the Royal Naval College in Den Helder, which he visited eight times between 1883 and 1905. Other favoured clients were Rolduc, a Catholic boarding school for boys (6 commissions) and the Episcopal College St. Joseph in Weert (5 commissions).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== British Isles ===\nIn Britain and Ireland, David was employed by the military. In York he photographed the 2nd Dragoon Guards (Queen's Bays) in 1899 (an album with 34 photographs). He also worked at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, as well as in the Loreto Convent in Gibraltar. In Limerick, Ireland, he photographed the 9th Field Battery of the Royal Artillery in the courtyard of the Mulgrave Street barracks in 1898.\n\n\n=== Northern Europe ===\nIn Scandinavia, he counted many schools among his clients, as well as military institutions and private businesses. He visited Denmark at least once but only photographs of schools in Copenhagen are recorded (1889/90). In Norway the emphasis lay on school photography, although he also had firemen posing in front of his camera, as well as workers at an arms manufacturor (1890, 1892, 1893/94, 1895, 1898, 1899, 1903 and 1908). In Sweden his clients consisted of shipbuilders, a paper factory and a railway company, as well as schools and military institutions, including an equestrian portrait of Prince Carl, Duke of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (1892, 1894, 1900, 1901 and at least once between 1905 and 1910). In Finland, David took photographs of the various infantry battalions of the Army of the Grand Duchy of Finland (1880s and 1890s). The Finnish revolutionary leader Johan Kock was photographed by David while in Paris.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Southern Europe ===\n\nIn 1878 David received a prestigious commission from the Holy See. It resulted in Le Vatican 1878, another luxury album with twenty double-mounted photographs of the new pope Leo XIII, his closest associates, the Papal Swiss Guard and various locations in the Vatican. A copy of this album with a dedication was presented to emperor Alexander II of Russia. There is only one other photograph, taken in Turin in 1895/96, to testify of David's presence in Italy.\nIn Spain, on the contrary, numerous visits are recorded between 1878 and 1909, including some return visits to clients, as was the case with the railway company Ferrocarriles Andaluces in Malaga in 1895, 1903, 1907 and 1908. Other clients included Catholic (and Protestant) schools, technical schools, military and naval schools, factories and an observatory. In 1890 he worked in Gran Canaria.David visited Portugal at least twice. In 1887/88 he took photographs at the University of Coimbra. A series of photographs of the Jesuit boarding school Col\u00e9gio Jesus Maria Jos\u00e9 in Lisbon is undated but must have been taken prior to October 1910, when the school was closed down as a result of the Portuguese Revolution. Only one visit to Greece is recorded.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\nDavid's busy schedule took him to every corner of Europe, and beyond. In Central and Eastern Europe he visited institutions and private enterprises in Poland, Moravia, Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Russia. His furthest journey, as far as we know, took him to Brazil in 1906 where he spent several weeks taking photographs at the Col\u00e9gio Militar in Rio de Janeiro, the Col\u00e9gio Notre-Dame de Sion in Petr\u00f3polis, and the S\u00e3o Paulo Railway around S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External link ==",

    "Panihati": "Panihati is a city and a municipality of North 24 Parganas district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is close to Kolkata and also a part of the area covered by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA).\n\n\n== History ==\nThere is a legendary belief that Maharaja Chandraketu of Deganga established a garh (fort) at Panihati in the 13th century. There is an association of goddess Bhawani with the fort. In the early days when river transport was the primary means of communication, Panihati was a major trading and business centre, then known as Pannyahati (Emporium for Merchandise). Scholars feel that the name has come from the word Pannyahatic. Panihati is mentioned in several Vaishnava Padavali literary texts \u2013 Chaitanya Mangal Kavya by Jayananda and Lochandas in the 16th century,  Sri Chaitanya Bhagawat by Brindaban Das in 1548, Bansi Bistar by Nityannda, Vaishnava Namdeva by Debaki Nandan, Sri Chaitanya Charitamritam by Krishnadas Kabiraj in 1580\u20131610, Bhakti Ratnakar and Chaitanya Chandroday. Panihati Municipality was established in 1900. This place is said to be visited by Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu on his way to Puri & later by his close associate Nityananda too, due to which Gaudiya Vaishnavas consider this place holy.\nGandhi Memorial Asram or Sodepur Khadi Pratisthan was established by Satish Chandra Dasgupta in 1921 at Panihati. Mahatma Gandhi himself visited  and stayed there several times in 1939, 1945, 1946 and 1947.With the partition of Bengal in 1947, \"millions of refugees poured in from East Pakistan.\" In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but \"it was squatters who made the East Bengali refugees famous or infamous.\" Squatting (jabardakhal in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. \"This happened as early as 1948 with middle class refugees in the Jadavpur area: first on government land and then on private property, leading to violent clashes. Having won the battle, the elated squatters named their colony \u2018Bijaygarh\u2019, the Fort of Victory.\" By 1949, there were 40 such colonies in Jadavpur, Kasba, Santoshpur, Garia and Behala, in the south-eastern part of the city, and 65 in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone in the north. Subsequently squatters colonies also came up along the west bank of the Hooghly and by 1950, there were 150 such colonies. It has to be borne in mind that the squatters were in a way \u201cself-settlers\u201d in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government/ administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres. Efforts have been made in more recent years to regularise land/property rights in the refugee colonies.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Location ===\nPanihati has an average elevation of 13 metres (42 feet).\n96% of the population of Barrackpore subdivision (partly presented in the map alongside, all places marked in the map are linked in the full screen map) lives in urban areas.

    "Carlsbad, California": "Carlsbad is a coastal city in the North County region of San Diego County, California, United States. The city is 87 miles (140 km) south of downtown Los Angeles and 35 miles (56 km) north of downtown San Diego and is part of the San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area. Carlsbad is a popular tourist destination and notable home for many businesses in the golf industry. The city's 2020 census population was 114,746 and the reported median household income was $123,409.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nCarlsbad's history began with the Luise\u00f1o people (the Spanish name given to them because of their proximity to Mission San Luis Rey), as well as some Kumeyaay in the La Costa area. Nearly every reliable fresh water creek had at least one native village, including one called Palamai.  The site is located just south of today's Buena Vista Lagoon.The first European land exploration of Alta California, the Spanish Portol\u00e1 expedition of 1769, met native villagers while camped on Buena Vista Creek. Another Luise\u00f1o villages within today's city of Carlsbad was a village at the mouth of the San Marcos Creek that the Kumeyaay called 'Ajopunquile'. A Kumeyaay village that was visited by Portol\u00e1 was Hakutl, in the Rancho Ponderosa area.During the Mexican period, in 1842, the southern portion of Carlsbad was granted as Rancho Agua Hedionda to Juan Mar\u00eda Marr\u00f3n.\nIn the 1880s a former sailor named John Frazier dug a well in the area. He began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier's Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the Bohemian town of Karlsbad (now Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic).To take advantage of the find, the Carlsbad Land and Mineral Water Company was formed by a German-born merchant from the Midwest named Gerhard Schutte together with Samuel Church Smith, D. D. Wadsworth and Henry Nelson. The naming of the town followed soon after, along with a major marketing campaign to attract visitors. The area experienced a period of growth, with homes and businesses sprouting up in the 1880s. Agricultural development of citrus fruits, avocados and olives soon changed the landscape. By the end of 1887, land prices fell throughout San Diego County. However, the community survived on the back of its fertile agricultural lands.\nThe site of John Frazier's original well can still be found at Alt Karlsbad, a replica of a German Hanseatic house, located on Carlsbad Boulevard.\nIn 1952, Carlsbad was incorporated to avoid annexation by its neighbor, Oceanside.The single-runway Palomar Airport opened in 1959 after County of San Diego officials decided to replace the Del Mar Airport.  The airport was annexed to the City of Carlsbad in 1978 and renamed McClellan-Palomar Airport in 1982 after a local civic leader, Gerald McClellan.\nThe first modern skateboard park, Carlsbad Skatepark, was built in March 1976. It was located on the grounds of Carlsbad Raceway and was designed and built by inventors Jack Graham and John O'Malley. The site of the original Carlsbad Skatepark and Carlsbad Raceway was demolished in 2005 and is now an industrial park. However, two skateparks have since been developed.\nIn March 1999, Legoland California was opened. It was the first Legoland theme park outside of Europe and is currently operated by Merlin Entertainments. Merlin Entertainments owns 70 percent of the shares, and the remaining 30 percent is owned by the  LEGO group and Kirkbi A/S.Carlsbad is home to the nation's largest desalination plant. Construction of the Carlsbad Desalination Plant at the Encina Power Station was completed in December 2015. The Encina Power Station is currently being demolished, despite efforts to preserve it as a historical landmark.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 39.1 square miles (101 km2) of which 37.7 square miles (98 km2) are land and 1.4 square miles (3.6 km2) are (3.55%) water, the majority of which is contained within three lagoons and one lake.\nThe northern area of the city is part of a tri-city area consisting of northern Carlsbad, southern Oceanside and western Vista.\nThe ocean-side cliffs fronting wide white-sand beaches and mild climate attract vacationers year-round.Types of Households in Carlsbad city, California in 2015\u20132019. 56.6% was Married-couple households, 5.1% was cohabiting couple households, 13.6% male householder no spouse, 24.7% female householder no spouse.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nCarlsbad has a semi-arid Mediterranean climate (Koppen classification BSh) and averages 263 sunny days per year. Winters are mild with periodic rain. Frost is rare along the coast, but sometimes occurs in inland valleys in December and January. Summer is almost rain free, but overcast and cool with fog off the Pacific. While most days have mild and pleasant temperatures, hot dry Santa Ana winds bring high temperatures on a few days each year, mostly in the fall.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nFor city planning and growth management purposes, Carlsbad is divided into four distinct quadrants.\n\n\n==== Northwest quadrant ====\nThe northwest quadrant of Carlsbad (ZIP code 92008) includes the downtown \"Village\", \"The Barrio\", and \"Olde Carlsbad.\" It was the first part of Carlsbad to be settled. Homes range from 1950s cottages and bungalows, 1960s ranch style houses, to elegant mansions on the hill overlooking the ocean. It is also home to Hosp Grove Park, a grove of eucalyptus trees relatively untouched by development and now designated by the city for recreational use, in addition to the Buena Vista and Agua Hedionda Lagoons. It is located west of El Camino Real and north of Palomar Airport Road.\n\"The Barrio\" area is near downtown Carlsbad bordered by Carlsbad Village Drive to the north, Tamarack Avenue to the south, Interstate 5 to the east and the railroad tracks to the west. It was settled by Latinos in the early 20th century. It is the site of the Centro de Aprendizaje, a Spanish division of the Carlsbad City Library.\n\n\n==== Northeast quadrant ====\nThis quadrant (ZIP code 92010) is located east of El Camino Real and north of Palomar Airport Road and consists mostly of single-family homes, with larger lots found in the older area known as Chestnut Hills and the newer developments around Calavera Hills.\nThe Northeast quadrant also contains the Lake Calavera Nature Preserve, a 110-acre space containing a 513-foot extinct volcano known as Mount Calavera. The preserve \u2014 notable for its small lake, wide dam, and mountain \u2014 was officially set aside in the 1990s as the surrounding land was being developed. The preserve is bordered on three sides by suburban single-family homes, and on one side by small farms and rural compounds. In 2012, Sage Creek High School was developed in the southwest corner of the preserve amid some controversy. Nature experts challenged the decision to construct the school on the preserve, but Carlsbad High School was reaching its capacity and there were few undeveloped areas that had sufficient space for an additional high school. Despite missing one of its original corners, the preserve still offers miles of hiking trails with ocean views.\n\n\n==== Southeast quadrant ====\nThe southeast quadrant (ZIP code 92009) is located east of El Camino Real and south of Palomar Airport Road and features several newer expensive master-planned communities set among hillsides, golf courses, Alga Norte Community Park and permanent open spaces. It includes Bressi Ranch and the La Costa neighborhoods of Rancho La Costa, La Costa Ridge, La Costa Oaks, La Costa Greens, La Costa Valley, and Rancho Carillo. In 1965, La Costa gave its name to the Gold Medal Golf Resort, La Costa Resort and Spa, now known as the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa. Residents here are served by the Carlsbad Unified School District, San Marcos Unified School District and the Encinitas Union School District.\n\n\n==== Southwest quadrant ====\nThis quadrant (ZIP code 92011) extends along the Pacific Ocean to the south of the center of Carlsbad. It includes the Aviara neighborhood, which is home to the Park Hyatt Aviara Resort. It is located west of El Camino Real and south of Palomar Airport Road.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== 2010 ===\nAs of the 2010 United States Census Carlsbad had a population of 105,328.

    "Anarchist Federation of Gran Canaria": "The Anarchist Federation of Gran Canaria (Spanish: Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista de Gran Canaria, FAGC) is an anarchist organization on the island of Gran Canaria, founded in 2011. It is focused on defending the right to decent housing.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn a context of social and labor precariousness, as well as the economic crisis in the Canary Islands, the Anarchist Federation of Gran Canaria was born from the confluence of different participants of the 15-M Movement in the Plaza de San Telmo in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, within which they identified themselves as the black bloc. They shared \"the \u00e1crata sentiment and a great desire to promote a change in this unjust system.\" From then on, the FAGC was made up of \"groups and individuals from different parts of the island, by people and groups with different experiences, sensitivities and preferences\". The group, partly made up of non-anarchist members, is made up of 90% women.\n\n\n== Premises and actions ==\nThe FAGC try to seek self-sufficiency based on the premise, \"do as you can and receive as you need\", and they have aligned themselves against any type of dirigisme. They claim the active role of the street and the need for a horizontal and self-managed action. They defend that it is necessary to first look for practical solutions and then develop the theory, thus exposing the problems of practice in a self-critical way.They have openly shown their criticism of yellow unionism.In 2013, the FAGC managed to relocate more than 70 people into empty buildings that belonged to banks or financial entities, following the ideas of the squatter movement and until 2016 it had managed to relocate more than 400 people on the island. The FAGC, unlike of the Stop Evictions platform, emphasizes cases of squatting, homelessness and renting.They also deal with the dissemination of libertarian ideas through social networks and, during their early years, with a weekly radio program: Voces libertarias.In 2018 a project emerged to give testimony in a documentary of the actions of the FAGC and the Tenant Union of Gran Canaria, under the title Precaristas: cr\u00f3nica de la lucha por la vivienda en Gran Canaria.\n\n\n=== \"La Esperanza\" Community ===\nThe organization Comunidad \"La Esperanza\" was born in the municipality of Santa Mar\u00eda de Gu\u00eda, which constitutes the largest squatting project in Spain and the most ambitious project of the FAGC.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nAnarchist Federation of Gran Canaria (2019).

    "Cane Spree": "Cane Spree is an annual autumn tradition at  The College of New Jersey (referred to then as Princeton College and now known as Princeton University) which began during the Gilded Age\u2014the period just after the Civil War, or the mid-to-late 1860s.  Cane Spree began as a riot between classes, turned into an annual event with each class designating a candidate for the wrestling, and ultimately shedded its violence altogether to become a regular intramural multi-sport event held on the campus.  The tradition endures today.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the Gilded-Age of the 1860s, fashionable and elegant gentlemen carried walking sticks (canes).  At Princeton College, sophomores were offended by seeing underclassmen carrying canes and would attack freshmen students found carrying canes in a sort of hazing ritual.\n\nWhat eventually became known as Cane Spree began as an actual riot on Nassau Street in Princeton, New Jersey where sophomores \"provoked by freshmen flaunting their canes\" attacked the freshmen, and relieving them of their canes in the process.  Later, Cane Spree (in its modified, non-violent form) became a common form of hazing on campus, ultimately becoming what was considered the \"first intramural sport\" at the college. In 1868, sophomores officially proclaimed a ban on all freshmen, prohibiting them from carrying canes on campus. Any freshman found carrying a cane was subject to attack from sophomores, their canes taken in the process.\nThe rules of Cane Spree were simple\u2014there were no rules\u2014except for a rule against biting. Cane Spree was described by Harrington DeGoyler Green as that [...Cane Spree would] \"weld the class together and put some spirit in it.\"  This was important because class identity and bonding is an important virtue at Princeton University. The 1868 Cane Spree inspired a song called \"Siege of Canes.\"Sometime in the 1870s the Princeton University administration attempted to implement controls to minimize the violence, however random attacks continued. On September 15, 1870, James McCosh (President of Princeton College)  interrupted a brawl between sophomores and freshmen and shouted \"Disperse, young men, or the bailiffs will be after you.\"  By 1891, Cane Spree was formally abolished, but the class fighting continued informally.  Between the 1880s and early 1900s as Cane Spree became an officially organized event; prominent newspapers would carry news of the winners, losers as well as details of what privileges the losers must relinquish.   Throughout the years, it was said that winning a cane in Cane Spree was \"the honor of a lifetime\".Cane Spree was reported in the New York Times, Scribner's Magazine, as well as local and university publications.While it has changed significantly since its origins in the 1860s, Cane Spree is a tradition that endures today, taking place in Princeton's football stadium in early October as a friendly and fun multi-sport battle for supremacy between the freshmen and sophomore classes.\n\n\n== Canes ==\nThe canes (walking sticks) carried by students were intricately carved and decorated by the class members themselves who etched their autograph or decorative mark onto the cane.  Many of the markings detail the intended profession or area of study of the engraver.  Canes were passed around for each carved name to be added then returned to their owner.\n\n\n=== Notable Names ===\nSeveral of the names carved on the Princeton College class of 1881 cane pictured above are members of prominent Gilded Age families and/or went on to become notable historical figures:\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Art Gallery of Ballarat": "The Art Gallery of Ballarat is the oldest and largest regional art gallery in Australia.  Established in 1884 as the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery by the citizens of Ballarat, both the building and part of its collection is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register \nand by the National Trust of Victoria.\nThe gallery was noted as the home of the original Eureka Flag (while the Flag is still part of the Gallery's collection, the Flag is on long term loan to the Eureka Centre Ballarat, at 102 Stawell Street South, Ballarat). The Art Gallery houses major collections covering the history of Australian art from the early colonial period to the present day, which are on display in a thematic hang covering a range of themes including Place, Home, Country and Disruption. For the first five years of the gallery's life, the Association rented the large supper room of the Ballarat Academy of Music, now Her Majesty's Theatre, which was made available by Sir William Clarke, 1st Baronet. The Association then worked to secure land on the site of the Government Camp and to raise funds for a permanent home for its collection.  Much of the energy and the money came from a prominent Ballarat citizen, James Oddie. The current building is the oldest purpose built art gallery building in Australia.  \nDesigned by Tappin, Gilbert and Dennehy in the Renaissance Revival architecture style as a bluestone brick and render facade and stone stairway, the foundation stone was laid by Sir William Clarke in 1887 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The new building was opened by Alfred Deakin on Friday 13 June 1890.The gallery is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, of which the City of Ballarat is the sole shareholder. It is administered by a board of directors. Louise Tegart is the current Director.\nThe Gallery is supported by the Art Gallery of Ballarat Foundation, which raises funds and receives donations on behalf of the gallery and by the Art Gallery of Ballarat Association, an independent organisation which established the gallery in 1884 and gave it to the Ballaarat City Council in 1972. Membership of the Association is open to members of the public and brings with it a range of benefits, including discounts at the Gallery shop and cafe and invitations to exhibition openings.\n\n\n== Redevelopment and restoration ==\n\nA 2001 public appeal raised $2 million for expansion of the gallery. The $7 million extension, built by H. Troon and designed by Peddle Thorp, was completed in 2001 to accommodate the expanding collection of contemporary works, temporary exhibits and gallery functions. In addition, two cast-iron verandahs, based on originals first installed on the Lydiard Street facade of the building in 1901 but removed in the 1960s, were reconstructed and reinstated.\nEntry to the gallery is free, with entry fees applying only to selected special exhibitions.\nA $1.85 million exterior restoration project began in 2009 and was completed in 2010. The renovation resulted in the reversal of unsympathetic 1950s renovations, including removal of paint from the facade and reopening of the windows.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe collection includes works from Fred Williams, Sidney Nolan, Clarice Beckett, Arthur Boyd, Rupert Bunny, William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, Rick Amor, Heinrich B\u0171rkel, Louis Buvelot, William Barak, Charles Conder, Dagmar Evelyn Cyrulla, Thomas Flintoff, S T Gill John Glover, Joy Hester, Hans Heysen, Nora Heysen, Norman Lindsay, Howard Arkley, E.

    "War crimes of the Wehrmacht": "During World War II, the Germans' combined armed forces (Heer, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe) committed systematic war crimes, including massacres, mass rape, looting, the exploitation of forced labor, the murder of three million Soviet prisoners of war, and participated in the extermination of Jews. While the Nazi Party's own SS forces (in particular the SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde, Einsatzgruppen and Waffen-SS) of Nazi Germany was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of the Holocaust, the regular armed forces of the Wehrmacht committed many war crimes of their own (as well as assisting the SS in theirs), particularly on the Eastern Front in the war against the Soviet Union. According to a study by Alex J. Kay and David Stahel, the majority of the Wehrmacht soldiers deployed to the Soviet Union participated in war crimes.\n\n\n== Creation of the Wehrmacht ==\nWhen the Nazi Party came to power, it was welcomed by almost the entire officer corps of the Reichswehr as a way of creating the Wiederwehrhaftmachung (remilitarization) of Germany, namely the total militarization of German society in order to ensure that Germany did not lose the next war. As such, what both the Nazis and the German Army wanted to see was a totally militarized Volksgemeinschaft (people's community) that would be purged of  perceived internal enemies like the Jews who it was believed had \"stabbed Germany in the back\" in 1918. The Wehrmacht was created by Adolf Hitler in 1935 with the passing of a law introducing conscription into the armed forces.  It was composed of volunteers and conscripts.\nMany officers therefore willingly embraced National Socialist ideology in the 1930s. Acting on his own initiative, the Defence Minister Werner von Blomberg had purged the Army of all its Jewish personnel in February 1934. On December 8, 1938, the Army leadership instructed all officers to be thoroughly well versed in National Socialism and to apply its values in all situations. Starting in February 1939, pamphlets were issued that were made required reading in the Army. The content can be gauged by the titles: \"The Officer and Politics\", \"Hitler's World Historical Mission\", \"The Army in the Third Reich\", \"The Battle for German Living Space\", \"Hands off Danzig!\", and \"The Final Solution of the Jewish Question in the Third Reich\". The latter essay proclaimed:The defensive battle against Jewry will continue, even if the last Jew has left Germany. Two big and important tasks remain: 1) the eradication of all Jewish influence, above all in the economy and in culture; 2) the battle against World Jewry, which tries to incite all people in the world against Germany. Attitudes like the ones expressed above colored all the instructions that came to Wehrmacht troops in the summer of 1939 as a way of preparing for the attack on Poland.\n\n\n== Criminal orders ==\nDuring the planning for the invasion of the Soviet Union a number of orders were devised by the Wehrmacht leadership. The orders contravened international law and established codes of conduct and became known collectively as \"Criminal Orders\". The orders were a declaration of war against the civilian population.In November 1935, the psychological war laboratory of the War Ministry submitted a study about how best to undermine Red Army morale should a German-Soviet war break out. Working closely with the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian Fascist Party based in Harbin, the German psychological warfare unit created a series of pamphlets written in Russian for distribution in the Soviet Union. Much of it was designed to play on Russian anti-Semitism, with one pamphlet calling the \"Gentlemen commissars and party functionaries\" a group of \"mostly filthy Jews\". The pamphlet ended with the call for \"brother soldiers\" of the Red Army to rise up and kill all of the \"Jewish commissars\".Although this material was not used at the time, later in 1941 the material the psychological war laboratory had developed in 1935 was dusted off, and served as the basis not only for propaganda in the Soviet Union but also for propaganda within the German Army. Before Barbarossa, German troops were exposed to violent anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic indoctrination via movies, radio, lectures, books and leaflets. The lectures were delivered by \"National Socialist Leadership Officers\", who were created for that purpose, and by their junior officers. German Army propaganda portrayed the Soviet enemy in the most dehumanized terms, depicting the Red Army as a force of Slavic Untermenschen (sub-humans) and \"Asiatic\" savages engaging in \"barbaric Asiatic fighting methods\" commanded by evil Jewish commissars to whom German troops were to grant no mercy.British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that junior officers tended to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them being Nazi Party members in 1941. The Wehrmacht did not just obey Hitler's criminal orders for Barbarossa because of obedience, but rather because they shared Hitler's belief that the Soviet Union was run by Jews, and that it was necessary for Germany to completely destroy \"Judeo-Bolshevism\".\n\n\n=== Commissar Order ===\n\nThe order cast the war against the Soviet Union as one of ideological and racial differences, and it provided for the immediate liquidation of political commissars in the Red Army. The order was formulated in 1941 with the participation of the Army High Command (the OKH) and issued by the Wehrmacht High Command (the OKW). General Franz Halder, welcomed it writing that \"Troops must participate in the ideological battle in the Eastern campaign to the end\".\nOn 17 July 1941, the OKW declared that the Wehrmacht was to:[F]ree itself from all elements among the prisoners of war considered Bolshevik driving forces. The special situation of the Eastern Campaign therefore demands special measures [an euphemism for killing] which are to be carried out free from bureaucratic and administrative influence and with a willingness to accept responsibility. While so far the regulations and orders concerning prisoners of war were based solely on military considerations, now the political objective must be attained, which is to protect the German nation from Bolshevik inciters and forthwith take the occupied territory strictly in hand. As such, all Soviet POWs considered to be commissars together with all Jewish POWs were to be handed over to the Einsatzgruppen to be shot. The OKW attached great importance to the killings of POWs believed to be commissars as it was believed that if the captured commissars reached POW camps in Germany that they would stage another German Stab-in-the-back like that believed to have caused Germany's defeat in World War I. Between July\u2013October 1941, between 580,000 and 600,000 POWs in Wehrmacht custody were turned over to the SS to be killed. In September 1941, both Helmuth James von Moltke and Admiral Wilhelm Canaris wrote memos pointing out to the OKW that the order of July 17, 1941 was illegal under international law.In particular, both Moltke and Admiral Canaris noted that the German claim that Soviet POWs had no rights because the Soviet Union had not ratified the Geneva Convention was invalid, as Germany had ratified the Geneva Convention and thus under international law was obliged to provide humane treatment for the POWs in its care. In response, Field-Marshal Wilhelm Keitel wrote: \"These scruples accord with the soldierly concepts of a chivalrous war! Here we are concerned with the extermination of an ideology. That is why I approve and defend this measure\".In the summer of 1942, there was an illusory liberalization of the treatment of captured political officers. On 10 June, the Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller issued an order on the segregation of prisoners and ordered that commissars be isolated from the rest of the prisoners and sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. However, this did not change the plight of commissars much, as Mauthausen was one of the worst Nazi concentration camps where they usually waited for a slow death. On 20 October 1942, M\u00fcller again ordered commissars captured in battle to be shot on the spot. Only those commissars who were identified as deserters were sent to Mauthausen. In the following months, reports continued to be filed regarding the executions of Soviet commissars. The last known account of the liquidation of a political officer came from units of Army Group South in July 1943.The historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster wrote that the majority of Wehrmacht officers sincerely believed that most Red Army commissars were Jews and that the best way to defeat the Soviet Union was to kill all of the commissars so as to deprive the Soviet soldiers of their Jewish leaders.\n\n\n=== Barbarossa Decree ===\n\nThe background behind the Barbarossa Decree was laid out by Hitler during a high-level meeting with military officials on 30 March 1941, where he declared that war against Soviet Russia would be a war of extermination, in which both the political and intellectual elites of Russia would be eradicated by German forces, in order to ensure a long-lasting German victory. Hitler underlined that executions would not be a matter for military courts, but for the organised action of the military.The decree, issued by Field Marshal Keitel a few weeks before Operation Barbarossa, exempted punishable offenses committed by enemy civilians (in Russia) from the jurisdiction of military justice. Suspects were to be brought before an officer who would decide if they were to be shot.\nThe order specified:\n\n\"The partisans are to be ruthlessly eliminated in battle or during attempts to escape\", and all attacks by the civilian population against Wehrmacht soldiers are to be \"suppressed by the army on the spot by using extreme measures, till [the] annihilation of the attackers;\n\"Every officer in the German occupation in the East of the future will be entitled to perform execution(s) without trial, without any formalities, on any person suspected of having a hostile attitude towards the Germans\", (the same applied to prisoners of war);\n\"If you have not managed to identify and punish the perpetrators of anti-German acts, you are allowed to apply the principle of collective responsibility. 'Collective measures' against residents of the area where the attack occurred can then be applied after approval by the battalion commander or higher level of command\";\nGerman soldiers who commit crimes against humanity, the USSR and prisoners of war are to be exempted from criminal responsibility, even if they commit acts punishable according to German law.Contrary to what was claimed after the war, the Wehrmacht generals such as Heinz Guderian, did not intend to mitigate the records of the jurisdiction of an order, or in any way violate Hitler's intentions. His command was intended solely to prevent individual excesses which could damage discipline within army ranks, without changing the extermination intentions of the order. As part of the policy of harshness towards Slavic \"sub-humans\" and to prevent any tendency towards seeing the enemy as human, German troops were ordered to go out of their way to mistreat women and children in Russia.\n\n\n=== Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia ===\nThe \"Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia\" issued by the OKW on 19 May 1941 declared \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" to be the most deadly enemy of the German nation, and that \"It is against this destructive ideology and its adherents that Germany is waging war\". The guidelines went on to demand \"ruthless and vigorous measures against Bolshevik inciters, guerrillas, saboteurs, Jews, and the complete elimination of all active and passive resistance.\" Influenced by the guidelines, in a directive sent out to the troops under his command, General Erich Hoepner of the Panzer Group 4 stated:The war against Russia is an important chapter in the German nation's struggle for existence. It is the old battle of the Germanic against the Slavic people, of the defence of European culture against Muscovite-Asiatic inundation and of the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism. The objective of this battle must be the demolition of present-day Russia and must therefore be conducted with unprecedented severity. Every military action must be guided in planning and execution by an iron resolution to exterminate the enemy remorselessly and totally. In particular, no adherents of the contemporary Russian Bolshevik system are to be spared.\n\n\n=== Other orders ===\nIn the same spirit, General M\u00fcller, who was the Wehrmacht's senior liaison officer for legal matters, in a lecture to military judges on June 11, 1941 advised the judges present that \"...in the operation to come, feelings of justice must in certain situations give way to military exigencies and then revert to old habits of warfare ... One of the two adversaries must be finished off. Adherents of the hostile attitude are not to be conserved, but liquidated\". General M\u00fcller declared that, in the war against the Soviet Union, any Soviet civilian who was felt to be hindering the German war effort was to be regarded as a \"guerrilla\" and shot on the spot. The Army's Chief of Staff, General Franz Halder, declared in a directive that in the event of guerrilla attacks, German troops were to impose \"collective measures of force\" by massacring villages.\nTypical of the German Army propaganda was the following passage from a pamphlet issued in June 1941:Anyone who has ever looked into the face of a Red commissar knows what the Bolsheviks are. There is no need here for theoretical reflections. It would be an insult to animals if one were to call the features of these, largely Jewish, tormentors of people beasts. They are the embodiment of the infernal, of the personified insane hatred of everything that is noble in humanity. In the shape of these commissars we witness the revolt of the subhuman against noble blood. The masses whom they are driving to their deaths with every means of icy terror and lunatic incitement would have brought about an end of all meaningful life, had the incursion not been prevented at the last moment;\" [the last statement is a reference to the \"preventive war\" that Barbarossa was alleged to be].\nGerman Army propaganda often gave extracts in newsletters concerning the missions for German troops in the East:\"It is necessary to eliminate the red sub-humans, along with their Kremlin dictators. German people will have a great task to perform the most in its history, and the world will hear more about that this task will be completed till the end.\nAs a result of this sort of propaganda, the majority of the Wehrmacht Heer officers and soldiers tended to regard the war in Nazi terms, seeing their Soviet opponents as so much sub-human trash deserving to be trampled upon. One German soldier wrote home to his father on 4 August 1941 that:The pitiful hordes on the other side are nothing but felons who are driven by alcohol and the [commissars'] threat of pistols at their heads ... They are nothing but a bunch of assholes! ... Having encountered these Bolshevik hordes and having seen how they live has made a lasting impression on me. Everyone, even the last doubter, knows today that the battle against these sub-humans, who've been whipped into a frenzy by the Jews, was not only necessary but came in the nick of time. Our F\u00fchrer has saved Europe from certain chaos.\nThe order was in line with the interests of the Wehrmacht command, which was eager to secure logistical facilities and routes behind the front line for the divisions on the Eastern Front.In October 1941, the commander of the 12th Infantry Division sent out a directive saying \"the carrying of information is mostly done by youngsters in the ages of 11\u201314\" and that \"as the Russian is more afraid of the truncheon than of weapons, flogging is the most advisable measure for interrogation\". The Nazis at the beginning of the war banned sexual relations between Germans and foreign slave workers. In accordance to these new racial laws issued by the Nazis; in November 1941, the commander of the 18th Panzer Division warned his soldiers not to have sex with \"sub-human\" Russian women, and ordered that any Russian women found having sex with a German soldier was to be handed over to the SS to be executed at once.A decree ordered on 20 February 1942 declared that sexual intercourse between a German woman and a Russian worker or prisoner of war would result in the latter being punished by the death penalty. During the war, hundreds of Polish and Russian men were found guilty of \"race defilement\" for their relations with German women and were executed.The Night and Fog Decree, issued by Hitler in 1941 and disseminated along with a directive from Keitel, was operated within the conquered territories in the West (Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands). The decree allowed those \"endangering German security\" to be seized and made to disappear without trace. Keitel's directive stated that \"efficient intimidation can only be achieved either by capital punishment or by measures by which the relatives of the criminal and the population do not know his fate.\"\n\n\n== Poland ==\n\nWehrmacht attitudes towards Poles were a combination of contempt, fear, and a belief that violence was the best way to deal with them.\n\n\n=== Mass murder of Polish civilians ===\nWehrmacht responded brutally to acts by alleged insurgents during the invasion of Poland in 1939 and was responsible for indiscriminate shootings of prisoners of war and civilians. Any act of defiance was met with the most ruthless violence, although the Army leadership did seek to discourage so-called \"wild\" shootings where Wehrmacht troops would shoot civilians on their own initiative or participate in murders conducted by the SS. Court-martial proceedings were begun against some of the junior officers who had led these shootings, but this was nullified on 4 October 1939, when Hitler pardoned all military personnel who had been involved in war crimes in Poland. After the end of hostilities, during the Wehrmacht's administration of Poland, which went on until 25 October 1939, 531 towns and villages were burned; the Wehrmacht carried out 714 mass executions, alongside many incidents of plunder, banditry and murder. Altogether, it is estimated that 16,376 Poles fell victim to these atrocities. Approximately 60% of these crimes were committed by the Wehrmacht. Wehrmacht soldiers frequently engaged in the massacre of Jews on their own, rather than just assisting in rounding them up for the SS.In the summer of 1940, Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the Reich Security Main Office (including the Gestapo), noted that: \"...compared to the crimes, robberies and excesses committed by the army [part of the Wehrmacht], the SS and the police don't look all that bad\". Even when the German Army was not involved in war crimes, all of the top military leaders were aware of what was happening in Poland. None objected on moral principles; the few who did object did so due to concerns about discipline. Moreover, the general who objected the loudest to war crimes in Poland, General Johannes Blaskowitz, was opposed to the Army committing war crimes with the SS, not the idea of atrocities against Poland. The Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that Blaskowitz was actually \"legitimizing murder\" by expressing approval of SS massacres while demanding that the Army be kept out of the massacres as damaging to discipline. Bartov wrote that once officers and troops saw that murder was \"legitimate\" in Poland, the effect was that the Army tended to copy the SS.Up to 13,000 soldiers and between 120,000 and 200,000 civilians were killed by German-led forces during the Warsaw Uprising. At least 5,000 German regular soldiers assisted the SS in crushing Polish resistance, most of them reserve units. Human shields were used by German forces during the fighting.Throughout the campaign Wehrmacht engaged in widespread theft and plunder of Polish citizens' property. Until 3 November 1939 the Wehrmacht sent to the Nazi Germany 10,000 train wagons with stolen property including agricultural machinery, furniture and food.In one of the Germany military's first acts of World War II the German air force, the Luftwaffe, bombed the Polish town of Wielu\u0144 and later went on to bomb cities across the country, including Warsaw, Frampol and various other cities. Collectively the bombings killed tens of thousands of Polish civilians. However, no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed prior to and during World War II which means that at the time, strategic bombings were not officially war crimes. For this reason, no German officers were prosecuted at the post-World War II Allied war crime trials for aerial raids.\n\n\n=== Massacres of Polish POWs ===\n\nNumerous examples exist in which Polish soldiers were killed after capture; for instance, at \u015alad\u00f3w, where 252 prisoners of war (POW)s were shot or drowned, at Ciepiel\u00f3w, where some 300 POWs were killed, and at Zambr\u00f3w, where a further 300 were killed. Polish POWs of Jewish origin were routinely selected and shot on the spot.The prisoners in the POW camp in \u017byrard\u00f3w, captured after the Battle of the Bzura, were denied any food and starved for ten days. In many cases Polish POWs were burned alive. Units of the Polish 7th Infantry Division were massacred after being captured in several individual acts of revenge for their resistance in combat. On September 11, Wehrmacht soldiers threw hand grenades into a school building where they kept Polish POWs. According to German historian Jochen B\u00f6hler, the Wehrmacht mass murdered at least 3,000 Polish POWs during the campaign.The killing of POWs by Wehrmacht soldiers started during the September 1939 Poland campaign. In many cases large groups of Polish soldiers were murdered after capture. Hitler's Commando Order, issued in 1942, provided \"justification\" for the shooting of enemy commandos, whether uniformed or not.\n\n\n== Belgium ==\n\nBetween 25 and 28 May 1940, the Wehrmacht committed several war crimes in and near the small Belgian village of Vinkt. Hostages were taken and used as human shields. As the Belgian Army continued to resist, farms were searched and looted, and more hostages were taken. In all, eighty-six civilians were executed. Besides Vinkt, other massacres and shootings happened with estimates of 600 victims.\n\n\n== France ==\nDuring the rout of the French Army, in June 1940, the Gro\u00dfdeutschland Regiment massacred African soldiers and their White officers it had taken prisoner near the Bois d'Eraine. Ten more Black Frenchmen were murdered near Lyon.The same month, 9th Infantry Division massacred Black soldiers of the 4th North African Infantry Division they had captured near Erquivillers. A German officer is cited in French reports as explaining \"an inferior race does not deserve to do battle with a civilized race such as the Germans.\"In September 1944, during the retreat from France, the garrison of Brest executed civilians and looted and destroyed civilian property during the Battle for Brest. The commander of the garrison, Generalleutnant Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke, was convicted of war crimes relating to these actions in 1951.The massacres include that of at least 1500 black French POWs of West African origin and was preceded by propaganda depicting the Africans as savages. From October 1942 onwards, the Wehrmacht carried out the 'Commando Order' calling for the summary execution of all captured commandos, even if in uniform. After the Italian armistice in 1943, many POWs were executed on several occasions when Italian troops resisted their forcible disarmament by the Germans. The massacre of the Acqui Division at Kefalonia is the most infamous.\n\n\n== The Balkans ==\n\nFollowing the Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat on 27 March 1941, Hitler considered this act to be a personal insult and called for the immediate destruction of Yugoslavia via F\u00fchrer Directive 25. Commencing on 6 April 1941, F\u00fchrer Directive 25 was enacted with a large scale bombing of Belgrade occurring in the early hours of the invasion. Indiscriminate bombing of civilian targets lead to the deaths of between 1,500 and 17,000 civilians. Following the end of the war, Generaloberst Alexander L\u00f6hr was found guilty of war crimes including his part in the bombing of Belgrade. He was executed in 1948.In Serbia and Greece, many villages were razed and their inhabitants murdered during anti-partisan operations. Examples in Greece include Alikianos, Chortiatis, Kaisariani, Kalavryta, Kali Sykia, Kallikratis, Kleisoura, Kondomari, Kommeno, Lyngiades, Malathyros, Mesovouno, Mousiotitsa, Paramythia and Skourvoula; the razings of Kandanos, Anogeia and Vorizia; the Viannos massacres; and numerous incidents of smaller scale.\n\n\n== Italy ==\nOn 26 March 1944, 15 uniformed US Army officers and men were shot without trial at La Spezia, in Italy, after orders of the commander of the German 75th Army Corps, General Anton Dostler, despite the opposition of his subordinates of the 135th Fortress Brigade. Dostler was sentenced to death by an American military tribunal and executed by firing squad in December 1945.\n\n\n== Soviet Union ==\nSome German officers had considered Communism in the Soviet Union to be a Jewish plot even before the Third Reich. In 1918, Karl von Bothmer, the German Army's plenipotentiary in Moscow called the Bolsheviks \"a gang of Jews\" and expressed the desire \"to see a few hundred of these louts hanging on the Kremlin wall\". Evaluations of the Red Army by the visiting Reichswehr officers during the period of German-Soviet co-operation in the 1920s often show anti-Semitism with comments about the \"Jewish slyness\" of General Lev Snitman or the \"Jewish blood\" of General Leonid Vajner being very typical.In 1932, Ewald Banse, a leading German professor and a member of the National Association for the Military Sciences (a group secretly financed by the Reichswehr) wrote in a pamphlet calling for \"intellectual world domination\" by Germany wrote that the Soviet leadership was mostly Jewish who dominated an apathetic and mindless Russian masses. In 1935, Colonel Carl-Heinrich von St\u00fclpnagel in a report about the military capacity of the Red Army wrote that the commissars were \"mostly of the Jewish race\".\n\n\n=== Reprisals and the Holocaust ===\n\nIn the spring of 1941, Heydrich and General Eduard Wagner successfully completed negotiations for co-operation between the Einsatzgruppen and the German Army to allow the implementation of \"special tasks\".  Following the Heydrich-Wagner agreement on 28 April 1941, Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch ordered when Operation Barbarossa began that all German Army commanders were to identify and register all Jews in the occupied areas in the Soviet Union at once and to co-operate fully with the Einsatzgruppen. Each Einsatzgruppe, in its area of operations, was under the control of the Higher SS and Police Leaders. In a further agreement between the Army and the SS concluded in May 1941 by General Wagner and Walter Schellenberg, it was agreed that the Einsatzgruppen in front-line areas were to operate under Army command while the Army would provide the Einsatzgruppen with all necessary logistical support. Under the guise of \"anti-bandit\" (Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung) operations, the Wehrmacht in the Soviet Union massacred Jews and other civilians. Co-operation with the SS in reprisals and anti-Jewish operations was close and intensive.\nIn August 1941, following the protests by two Lutheran chaplains about the massacre of a group of Jewish women and children at Byelaya Tserkov, General von Reichenau wrote:The conclusion of the report in question contains the following sentence, \"In the case in question, measures against women and children were undertaken which in no way differ from atrocities carried out by the enemy about which the troops are continually being informed\".I have to describe this assessment as incorrect, inappropriate and impertinent in the extreme. Moreover this comment was written in an open communication which passes through many hands. It would have been far better if the report had not been written at all. One SS man who saw the killings at Byelaya Tserkov described them as follows:I went to the woods alone. The Wehrmacht had already dug a grave. The children were brought along in a tractor. I had nothing to do with this technical procedure. The Ukrainians were standing around trembling. The children were taken down from the tractor. They were lined up along the top of the grave and shot so that they fell into it. The Ukrainians did not aim at any particular part of the body. They fell into the grave. The wailing was indescribable. I shall never forget the scene throughout my life. I find it very hard to bear. I particularly remember a small fair-haired girl who took me by the hand. She too was shot later ... The grave was near some woods. It was not near the rifle-range. The execution must had taken place in the afternoon at about 3.30 or 4.00. It took place the day after the discussions at the Feldkommandanten...Many children were hit four or five times before they died.\nIn the summer of 1941, the SS Cavalry Brigade commanded by Hermann Fegelein during the course of \"anti-partisan\" operations in the Pripyat Marshes killed 699 Red Army soldiers, 1,100 partisans and 14,178 Jews. Before the operation, Fegelein had been ordered to shoot all adult Jews while driving the women and children into the marshes. After the operation, General Max von Schenckendorff, who commanded the Army Group Centre Rear Area ordered on 10 August 1941 that all Wehrmacht security divisions when on anti-partisan duty were to emulate Fegelein's example and organized between 24 and 26 September 1941 in Mogilev, a joint SS-Police-Wehrmacht training event on how best to murder \"partisans\", and by extension, Jews. The seminar, which became known as the Mogilev Conference, ended with the 7th Company of Police Battalion 322 of the Order Police shooting 32 Jews at a village called Knjashizy before the assembled officers as an example of how to \"screen\" the population for partisans. As the war diary of the Battalion 322 read: The action, first scheduled as a training exercise was carried out under real-life conditions (ernstfallm\u00e4ssig) in the village itself. Suspicious strangers, especially partisans, could not be found. The screening of the population, however, resulted in 13 Jews, 27 Jewish women and 11 Jewish children, of which 13 Jews and 19 Jewish women were shot in co-operation with the Security Service.\nBased on what they had learned during the Mogilev Conference, one Wehrmacht officer told his men \"Where the partisan is, there is the Jew and where the Jew is, there is the partisan\". The 707th Infantry Division of the Wehrmacht put this principle into practice during an \"anti-partisan\" sweep that saw the division shoot 10,431 people out of the 19,940 it had detained during the sweep while suffering only two dead and five wounded in the process.\nIn Order No. 24 dated 24 November 1941, the commander of the 707th Division declared:5. Jews and Gypsies: ... As already has been ordered, the Jews have to vanish from the flat country and the Gypsies have to be annihilated too. The carrying out of larger Jewish actions is not the task of the divisional units. They are carried out by civilian or police authorities, if necessary ordered by the commandant of White Ruthenia, if he has special units at his disposal, or for security reasons and in the case of collective punishments. When smaller or larger groups of Jews are met in the flat country, they can be liquidated by divisional units or be massed in the ghettos near bigger villages designated for that purpose, where they can be handed over to the civilian authority or the SD.\nAt Mirgorod, the 62nd Infantry Division executed \"the entire Jewish population (168 people) for associating with partisans\". At Novomoskovsk, the 444th Security Division reported that they had killed \"305 bandits, 6 women with rifles (Flintenweiber), 39 prisoners-of-war and 136 Jews\". In revenge for a partisan attack that had killed one German soldier, the Ersatz-Brigade 202 \"as an act of retaliation shot 20 Jews from the villages of Bobosjanka and Gornostajewka and burnt down 5 Jew-houses\". Even more extreme was the case in Serbia, where the majority of the Jews there were murdered by the Wehrmacht, not the SS.At \u0160abac in Dulag 183, a German transit camp for POWs in World War II Serbia, which opened in September 1941 (and closed in September 1944), Partisan POWs and members of their families were held. It is estimated that more than 5,000 persons were executed, not counting Jews and Roma people. \"Central European Jewish refugees, mostly Austrians, were shot by troops of predominantly Austrian origin in retaliation for casualties inflicted by Serbian partisans on the German Army\". The orders issued by Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel in September 1941 called for the German Army to shoot 100 Serbs for every German soldier killed by the Serb guerrillas and did not call for Jews to be singled out. Due to rampant anti-Semitism in the German officer corps, Serbian Jews were scapegoated and targeted for mass retaliatory shootings. German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster, a leading expert on the subject of Wehrmacht war crimes, argued the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust and it is wrong to ascribe the Shoah as solely the work of the SS while the Wehrmacht were a more or less passive and disapproving bystander.\n\nThe Wehrmacht also worked very closely with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering members of the Jewish population of the Soviet Union. On October 10, 1941 General Walther von Reichenau drafted an order to be read to the troops under his command stating that: \"the soldier must achieve full understanding of the necessity for a harsh but just vengeance against Jewish subhumanity.\" Upon hearing of Reichenau's Severity Order, Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of Army Group South announced his \"complete agreement\" with it, and sent out a circular to all of the Army generals under his command urging them to send out their own versions of the Severity Order, which would impress upon the troops the need to exterminate Jews.\nGeneral Erich von Manstein, in an order to his troops on 20 November 1941 stated: Jewry is the middleman between the enemy at our rear and the still fighting remnants of the Red Army and the Red leadership; more than in Europe, it [Jewry] occupies all key posts of the political leadership and administration, of trade and crafts and forms the nucleus for all disquiet and possible revolts. The Jewish-Bolshevist system must be exterminated once and for all. On 6 July 1941 Einsatzkommando 4b of Einsatzgruppe C \u2013 which was operating in Tarnopol at the time \u2013 sent a report which noted \"Armed forces surprisingly welcome hostility against the Jews\". On 8 September 1941 Einsatzgruppe D reported that relations with the German Army were \"excellent\". Franz Walter Stahlecker of Einsatzgruppe A wrote in September 1941 that Army Group North had been exemplary in co-operating with his men in murdering Jews and that relations with the Fourth Panzer Army commanded by General Erich Hoepner were \"very close, almost cordial\".\n\n\n=== Soviet POW camps ===\n\nThe Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War had been signed by Germany and most other countries in 1929, while the USSR and Japan did not sign until after the war (the final version of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949). This meant that Germany was legally obliged to treat all POWs according to it, while in turn, Germans captured by the Red Army could not expect to be treated in such a manner. The Soviet Union and Japan did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with the Geneva Convention. While the Wehrmacht's prisoner-of-war camps for inmates from the west generally satisfied the humanitarian requirement prescribed by international law, prisoners from Poland (which never capitulated) and the USSR were incarcerated under significantly worse conditions.By December 1941, more than 2.4 million Soviet Red Army troops had been taken prisoner. These men suffered from malnutrition and diseases such as typhus that resulted from the Wehrmacht's failure to provide sufficient food, shelter, proper sanitation and medical care. Prisoners were regularly subject to torture, beatings and humiliation. All Jews, commissars, \"intellectuals\" and Muslims serving in the Red Army were either executed by the Wehrmacht or handed over to the SS to be shot.\nThe Muslim POWs were shot because they were circumcised, and therefore might be Jewish; it was felt to be safer to simply shoot all circumcised POWs rather run the risk that a Jewish POW might escape execution by claiming to be a Muslim. Reflecting the close co-operation between the Wehrmacht and the SS was an Einsatzgruppen report, which read:In Borispol, following a demand by the Commandant of the local P/W camp, a platoon of Sonderkommando 4 shot 752 Jewish prisoners of war on 14 October and 356 on 16 October 1941 including several commissars and 78 wounded Jews handed over by the camp medical officer.\nAccording to a RHSA report of 5 December 1941, the Wehrmacht had, since 22 June, handed over to the Einsatzgruppen 16,000 Soviet POWs to be liquidated.Between the launching of Operation Barbarossa in the summer of 1941 and the following spring, 2.8 million of the 3.2 million prisoners taken died while in German hands. The German failure to attain their anticipated victory in the East led to significant shortages of labor for German war production and, beginning in 1942, prisoners of war in the eastern POW camps \u2013 primarily Soviets \u2013 were seen as a source of slave labor to keep Germany's wartime economy running.On 6 August 1941, the OKW declared that Soviet POWs capable of work were to receive 2,200 calories/day and those not capable of work 2,040 calories/day. On 21 October 1941, the OKW ordered a huge reduction in the food rations for Soviet POWs, with POWs incapable of work henceforth to receive only 1,490 calories/day. In a meeting of senior generals called at Or\u0161a on 13 November 1941, the Army's First quarter-master General Eduard Wagner stated \"Non-working prisoners of war in the camps are to starve\".5.7 million Soviet soldiers were taken prisoner during the war, of whom at least 3.3 million (58 percent of the total) died in captivity.According to the Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, it was typical for camps devoted to armaments production to be run by the branch of the Wehrmacht that used the products. Many places used Luftwaffe guards in concentration camps. In 1944, many Wehrmacht soldiers were transferred to the SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde to alleviate personnel shortages in concentration camps.\n\n\n== North Africa ==\nNewer research has exposed Wehrmacht war crimes in North Africa. This opposes the term \"War without hate\" which is used by some authors to describe the North African Campaign.Giordana Terracina writes that: \"On April 3, the Italians recaptured Benghazi and a few months later the Afrika Korps led by Rommel was sent to Libya and began the deportation of the Jews of Cyrenaica in the concentration camp of Giado and other smaller towns in Tripolitania. This measure was accompanied by shooting, also in Benghazi, of some Jews guilty of having welcomed the British troops, on their arrival, treating them as liberators.\"Jews from all around Cyrenaica and Benghazi were deported into Italy for forced labour. At the Giado concentration camp, a survivor by the name of Sion Burbea testifies that he witnessed Erwin Rommel inspecting their work at the camp.Some historians directly connect Rommel with the war crimes of the Wehrmacht in North Africa. According to German historian Wolfgang Proske, Rommel forbade his soldiers from buying anything from the Jewish population of Tripoli, used Jewish slave labour and commanded Jews to clear out minefields by walking on them ahead of his forces.  Proske also claims that Jews in Tripoli were later sent to Concentration Camps. The Wehrmacht's persecution of Jews continued into 1942. According to the publication Jewish Communities of the World edited by Anthony Lerman, in 1942 during the German occupation, the Benghazi quarter that housed the Jewish population was plundered and 2000 Jews were deported across the desert, out of which circa a fifth of them had perished.  Jews in Benghazi were also victims of a pogrom in 1942  The Moment Magazine reports: \"on orders from the German military commander, the Axis forces, in 1942, plundered Jewish shops and deported 2,600 Benghazi Jews to Giado\".Robert Satloff writes in his book Among the Righteous: Lost Stories from the Holocaust's Long Reach into Arab Lands that as the German and Italian forces retreated across Libya towards Tunisia, the Jewish population became victims upon which they released their anger and frustration. According to Satloff, Afrika Korps soldiers plundered Jewish property all along the Libyan coast. This violence and persecution only came to an end with the arrival of General Montgomery in Tripoli on January 23 1943.  German historian Clemens Vollnhals writes that the use of Jews by Afrika Korps as forced labour is barely known, but it did happen alongside persecution of Jewish population (although on smaller scale than in Europe) and some of the labourers were worked to death. The persecution of Jews by the Wehrmacht continued into Tunisia. According to several historians, allegations and stories that associate Rommel and the Afrika Korps with the harassing and plundering of Jewish gold and property in Tunisia are usually known under the name \"Rommel's treasure\" or \"Rommel's gold\".   Other historians, however, state that Rommel had nothing to do with the treasure, and that \"Rauff's treasure would be a more appropriate name.  \nWhen the Wehrmacht entered Tunisia, they ordered the establishment of a Judenrat and Jews were subject to forced labour. 2,000 Jewish men were forcefully conscripted, and a few thousand more would be conscripted later on. This forced labour was used in extremely dangerous situations near targets of bombing raids, facing hunger and violence. \n\n\n== Rape ==\n\n\n=== Eastern Front ===\nGerman soldiers used to brand the bodies of captured partisan women \u2013 and other women as well \u2013 with the words \"Whore for Hitler's troops\" and rape them. Following their capture some German soldiers vividly bragged about committing rape and rape-homicide.\nSusan Brownmiller argues that rape played a pivotal role in the Nazis' aim to conquer and destroy people they considered inferior, such as Jews, Russians, and Poles. An extensive list of rapes committed by German soldiers was compiled in the so-called \"Molotov Note\" in 1942. Brownmiller points out that Nazis used rape as a weapon of terror.Examples of mass rapes in Soviet Union committed by German soldiers include:\n\nSmolensk: German command opened a brothel for officers in which hundreds of women and girls were driven by force, often by arms and hair.\nLviv: 32 women working in a garment factory were raped and murdered by German soldiers, in a public park. A priest trying to stop the atrocity was murdered.\nLviv: Germans soldiers raped Jewish girls, who were murdered after getting pregnant.It is estimated that over a million children were born to Russian women, fathered by German soldiers.:\u200a56\u200aAuthor Ursula Schele, estimated in the Journal \"Zur Debatte um die Ausstellung Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941\u20131944\" that one in ten women raped by German soldiers would have become pregnant, and therefore it is probable that up to ten million women in the Soviet Union could have been raped by the Wehrmacht.:\u200a9\u200aOther sources estimate that rapes of Soviet women by the Wehrmacht range up to 10,000,000 incidents, with between 750,000 and 1,000,000 children being born as a result.In Soviet Russia rapes were only a concern if they undermined military discipline. Since 1941, rape was theoretically punishable with the death sentence, although rapes were rarely prosecuted in practice and rapes by Germans of non-German women were not taken seriously, nor was it punishable by death, especially in the eastern European territories.:\u200a288\u200a In October 1940 the laws on rape were changed, making it a \"petitioned crime\" \u2013 that is a crime for which punishment had to be requested. Historian Christa Paul writes that this resulted in \"a nearly complete absence of prosecution and punishment for rape\".:\u200a288\u200a There were rape cases in the east where the perpetrators were sentenced if the rape were highly visible, damaging to the image of the German Army and the courts were willing to pass a condemning verdict against the accused.:\u200a289\u200aAccording to the historian Regina M\u00fchlh\u00e4user, the Wehrmacht also used sexual violence and undressing in numerous cases of interrogations. M\u00fchlh\u00e4user adds that the number of illegitimate children born in the occupied regions did not exceed the prewar time. She comes to the conclusion that rapes on the Eastern front were not singular cases but has to admit that the state of source material is very poor.There were rapes committed by soldiers of the Wehrmacht forces against Jewish women and girls during the Invasion of Poland. Rapes were also committed against Polish women and girls during mass executions carried out primarily by the Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz, which were accompanied by Wehrmacht soldiers and on territory under the administration of the German military, the rapes were carried out before shooting the female captives.Only one case of rape was prosecuted by a German court during the military campaign in Poland, the case of gang rape committed by three soldiers against women of the Jewish Kaufmann family in Busko-Zdr\u00f3j; however, the German judge sentenced the guilty for Rassenschande \u2013 shame against the [German] race as defined by the racial policy of Nazi Germany \u2013 and not rape.\n\n\n=== Western Front ===\nRape, while officially forbidden, was allowed in practice by the German military in eastern and southeastern Europe, while northern and western countries were relatively spared. In Occupied Denmark, which initially agreed to collaborate with Nazi Germany, rapes were not widespread, and German officials promised to punish them. By contrast thousands of Soviet female nurses, doctors and field medics fell victim to rape when captured, and were often murdered afterwards.In France, there were some rapes in 1940 immediately after the invasion and then very few cases until 1944, when the number of cases spiked. The German command initially worked to reduce the number of rapes committed, because rapes during World War I had harmed the reputation of the German army. In 1944 the rapes were increasingly tolerated by the German hierarchy and occurred alongside massacres and looting, typically during anti-partisan operations. A photograph of a woman being gang-raped was included in the \"Hitler's Crimes\" exhibit displayed in Paris in 1945.\n\n\n=== Military justice ===\nBirgit Beck, in her work Rape: The Military Trials of Sexual Crimes Committed by Soldiers in the Wehrmacht, 1939\u20131944, describes the leniency in punishing sex crimes by German authorities in the East, at the same time pointing out heavy punishments applied in the West. If a soldier who committed a rape was subsequently convicted by a court-martial, he would usually be sentenced to four years in prison The German penal code was also valid for soldiers in war. Until 1944 5,349 soldiers of the Wehrmacht on all fronts were sentenced because of indecency offence \"Sittlichkeitsvergehen\" or rape \"Notzucht\". Historian M\u00fchlh\u00e4user believed that sexual assault was not an exception but common, and that the actual number of rapes committed by German soldiers are without question much greater.\n\n\n=== Wehrmacht brothel system ===\n\nUnder the German occupation, a widespread system of sexual slavery (forced prostitution) was instituted. The Wehrmacht also ran brothels where women were forced to work. The reason for establishing these brothels was the German officials' fear of venereal disease and onanism (masturbation). The Oberfeldarzt der Wehrmacht (Chief Field Doctor of the Wehrmacht) drew attention to \"the danger of [the] spread of homosexualism\".On 3 May 1941, the Foreign Ministry of the Polish Government in Exile in London issued a document describing the mass raids carried out in Polish cities with the aim of capturing young women, who were later forced to work in brothels attended by German officers and soldiers.In the Soviet Union women were kidnapped by German forces for prostitution; one report by the International Military Tribunal stated that \"in the city of Smolensk the German Command opened a brothel for officers in one of the hotels into which hundreds of women and girls were driven; they were mercilessly dragged down the street by their arms and hair.\"\n\n\n=== Trials ===\nThe Nuremberg trials did not prosecute anyone for rape or other sexual violence; rape was defined as a crime against humanity, but prosecutors deemed that such crimes had \"no nexus to war\".\n\n\n== Human experimentation ==\n\nThroughout the war Germany engaged in numerous experiments on human prisoners and POWs. The Wehrmacht had full knowledge of those experiments, and performed some of its own. It provided assistance regarding:\n\nHigh altitude tests\nDrinking seawater\nFreezing of the human body\ntyphus research.In many cases the test subjects, even if they survived, were murdered afterwards to study any changes within their bodies that happened during the experiment.Examples of experiments conducted by the Wehrmacht include:\n\nExperiments on homosexuals: Wehrmacht doctors wanted to \"cure\" homosexuality by hormone treatments and putting homosexuals into battle.\nExperiments on prisoners at Auschwitz-Birkenau by doctor Emil Kaschub. Kaschub came from Upper Silesia and was an ensign in the Wehrmacht (he was not a member of the SS). He performed experiments on the limbs of middle-aged and young prisoners; they would deliberately be infected with various toxic substances, which caused sores, abscesses and pain. The condition of the patients would be photographed by Kaschub every few days and liquid from their wounds collected. The probable motive for those experiments was to find out how soldiers made themselves sick in order to escape service in the Wehrmacht.\nIn August 1941, the staff doctor assigned to the Sixth Army, Gerhart Panning, learned about captured Russian dumdum bullets by using Jewish POWs. To determine the effects of this type of ammunition on German soldiers, he decided to test them on other human beings after asking SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer (Colonel) and a member of the SD Paul Blobel for some \"guinea pigs\", (Jewish POWs).\n\n\n== Biological warfare ==\nDuring the war members of the Wehrmacht attempted to influence Hitler's decision to study biological warfare only regarding defense. The head of the Science Division of the Wehrmacht, Erich Schumann, urged the F\u00fchrer that \"America must be attacked simultaneously with various human and animal epidemic pathogens, as well as plant pests.\" Laboratory tests were prepared for the use of plague, anthrax, cholera and typhoid. The possibility of using foot and mouth disease against Britain was also studied.\n\n\n== Postwar views ==\n\n\n=== Evolving analysis ===\nHigh-ranking Wehrmacht officers stood trial for war crimes. The Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) commander-in-chief, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, and chief of operations staff Alfred Jodl were both indicted and tried for war crimes by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg through 1945\u20131946. They were convicted of all charges, sentenced to death and executed by hanging, although Jodl was acquitted post-mortem seven years later. While the tribunal declared that the Gestapo, SD and SS (including the Waffen-SS) were inherently criminal organizations, the court did not reach the same conclusion with  the Wehrmacht General Staff and High Command.\nThe Nuremberg Trials at the end of World War II initially considered whether the Wehrmacht high command structure should be tried. However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW \u2013 High Command of the Armed Forces) was judged not to be a criminal organization under the legal grounds that because of very poor co-ordination between the German Army, Navy and Air Force high commands, which operated as more or less separate entities during the war, the OKW did not constitute an \"organization\" as defined by Article 9 of the constitution of the International Military Tribunal (IMT) which conducted the Nuremberg trials. This matter of legal definition has been misconstrued by German World War II veterans and others to mean that the IMT ruled that the OKW was not a \"criminal organization\" because the Wehrmacht committed no war crimes.The prosecution of war crimes lost momentum during the 1950s as the Cold War intensified; both German states needed to establish armed forces and could not do so without trained officers and soldiers that had served in the Wehrmacht. German historiography in the 1950s viewed war crimes by German soldiers as exceptional rather than ordinary; soldiers were seen as victims of the Nazi regime. Traces of this attitude can still be seen in some German works today, which minimize the number of soldiers who took part in Nazi crimes. This was especially the case as the German public in the immediate post-war period were more interested in seeing themselves rather than others as victims. Thus the subject of Red Army atrocities against German civilians in 1944\u201345 received vastly more popular and historical interest in the 1950s than did the subject of Wehrmacht atrocities against Soviet civilians in 1941\u201344.Beyond that, Operation Barbarossa had been portrayed in Germany as a \"preventive war\" forced on Germany by Soviet attack alleged to be planned for July 1941. This claim was widely believed in the Reich during the war, and indeed was so popular that as late as the 1950s some West German historians were still arguing Operation Barbarossa was a \"preventive war\". As a result of this view of Operation Barbarossa, for many Germans, violence inflicted by the Wehrmacht on Soviet civilians and POWs was seen as something that the Soviets had brought down on themselves, hence the absence of any guilt on the part of many Germans. Cold War priorities and taboos about revisiting the most unpleasant aspects of World War II meant that the Wehrmacht's role in war crimes was not seriously re-examined until the early 1980s.In their memoirs, German Army generals claimed that the war had been a \"clean war\" on their part with the Army fighting because of the noble Prussian-German traditions, patriotism and a deep sense of honour and duty and that National Socialism had virtually no influence on the Army. In this version, almost all German war crimes were the work of the SS and any \"excesses\" committed by the Army were only the product of a long and bitter war and were no different from Allied war crimes. Very typical were the claims of one Infantry commander, who stated in his memoirs that all of the battles fought by his men were \"always fairly conducted, though tough and bitter.\" Such claims were widely believed not only in Germany but abroad, with the British military historian Captain Basil Liddell Hart writing that \"the German Army in the field on the whole observed the rules of war better than in 1914\u201318\".On 11 December 1979, the West German television show Report aired a documentary entitled \"Crimes of the Wehrmacht in World War Two\". The public's reaction was almost overwhelmingly negative, with World War II veterans leading a campaign to have the producer of Report fired for the \"defamation\" of German soldiers. This despite the fact \u2013 as the German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster was to write in 1989 \u2013 that the producers of the documentary had gone out of their way to be fair and unbiased.\nIn 1986, the German historian Hans Mommsen wrote about the role of the Wehrmacht under National Socialism:The leadership of the Wehrmacht rather willingly made themselves into accomplices in the policy of extermination. It did this by generating the \"criminal orders\" and implementing them. By no means did they merely passively support the implementation of their concept, although there was a certain reluctance for reasons of military discipline and a few isolated protests. To construct a \"causal nexus\" over all this amounts in fact to steering away from the decisive responsibility of the military leadership and the bureaucratic elites.\nBritish historian Ian Kershaw wrote that the genocide and extreme brutality used by the Nazis was their way of ensuring the Lebensraum (\"living space\") for the people who met the strict requirements of being part of Hitler's Aryan Herrenvolk (\"Aryan master race\") and the elimination of the Slavic people:The Nazi revolution was broader than just the Holocaust. Its second goal was to eliminate Slavs from central and eastern Europe and to create a Lebensraum for Aryans. ... As Bartov (The Eastern Front; Hitler's Army) shows, it barbarised the German armies on the eastern front. Most of their three million men, from generals to ordinary soldiers, helped exterminate captured Slav soldiers and civilians. This was sometimes cold and deliberate murder of individuals (as with Jews), sometimes generalised brutality and neglect. ... German soldiers' letters and memoirs reveal their terrible reasoning: Slavs were 'the Asiatic-Bolshevik' horde, an inferior but threatening race.\nIn 1989, the British historian Richard J. Evans wrote that right from the beginning of the war against the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht fought a genocidal war of \"extreme brutality and barbarism\". Evans noted that the Wehrmacht officers regarded the Russians as \"sub-human\", were from the time of the invasion of Poland in 1939 telling their troops that war was caused by \"Jewish vermin\", and explained to the troops that the war against the Soviet Union was a war to wipe out what were variously called \"Jewish Bolshevik subhumans\", the \"Mongol hordes\", the \"Asiatic flood\" and the \"red beast\".Such views helped to explain why 3,300,000 of the 5,700,000 Soviet POWs taken by the Germans died in captivity. In 1992, Omer Bartov noted that the three leaders of the \"new revisionism\" in German history that sparked the Historikerstreit of the late 1980s were all in some ways seeking to promote the image of the Wehrmacht as a force for the good, and seeking to portray the Wehrmacht as a victim of the Allies rather the victimizer of the peoples of Europe, writing of \"the bizarre inversion of the Wehrmacht's roles proposed by all three exponents of the new revisionism, whereby overtly or by implication the Army is transformed from culprit to saviour, from an object of hatred and fear to one of empathy and pity, from victimizer to victim\". Specifically, Bartov noted that:\n\nMichael St\u00fcrmer's geographical interpretation of German history meant that Germany's \"mission\" in Central Europe was to serve as a bulwark against the Slavic menace from the East in both World Wars.\nErnst Nolte's argument about a \"causal nexus\" with the National Socialist genocide as a logical, if extreme response to the horrors of Communism led to Wehrmacht crimes in the Soviet Union being portrayed as essentially justified. This was even more the case as Nolte insisted that Operation Barbarossa was as Hitler claimed a \"preventive war\", which meant that for Nolte, Wehrmacht war crimes were portrayed as a defensive response to the threat posed to Germany by the \"Asiatic hordes\".\nAndreas Hillgruber's call for historians to \"identity\" and \"empathize\" with German troops fighting on the Eastern Front in 1944\u201345 implicitly devalued the lives of those suffering and dying in the Holocaust, which was allowed to continue in part because the German troops held out for so long.Bartov wrote that all three historians had in varying ways sought to justify and excuse Wehrmacht war crimes by depicting the Wehrmacht as engaging in a heroic battle for Western civilization, often using the same language as the Nazis such as referring to the Red Army as the \"Asiatic hordes\". Bartov ended that these sorts of arguments reflected a broader unwillingness of the part of some Germans to admit to what their Army did during the war. In 1998, the historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster wrote that for too long most people have accepted at face value the self-serving claims made by generals like Erich von Manstein and Siegfried Westphal whose memoirs promoted the myth of the clean Wehrmacht, the notion the Wehrmacht had been a highly professional, apolitical force and its generals were victims of Adolf Hitler rather than his followers.In reality, the Wehrmacht played a key role in the Holocaust in Eastern Europe and other war crimes. The claims promoted after the war that the Wehrmacht had been an \"untarnished shield\" with the Army somehow standing apart from the regime it served so loyally was a myth that no serious historian had taken seriously since the 1980s.In 2019 the historian David W. Wildermuth noted that while the myth of the \"clean Wehrmacht\" has been largely dispelled among historians, it retains a following with the general public. He suggested that a reason for this is that few case studies have been published which identify specific units which were involved in war crimes.\n\n\n=== Portrayal on film ===\nIn his 2004 essay \"Celluloid Soldiers\" about post-war German films, the Israeli historian Omer Bartov wrote that German films of the 1950s showed the average German soldier as a heroic victim: noble, tough, brave, honourable and patriotic, while fighting hard in a senseless war for a regime that he did not care for. The 08/15 film trilogy of 1954\u201355 concerns a sensitive young German soldier named Asch (Joachim Fuchsberger). No mention is ever made of the genocidal aspects of Germany's war in the East with instead the German soldiers being shown as the victims of a war that they can not fathom the reasons for. Bartov commented that given the intense indoctrination in the Wehrmacht about how the war against the Soviet Union was a war to destroy \"Judeo-Bolshevism\" that Asch would most definitely have known what they were fighting for.The war on the Eastern Front was portrayed in a manner that suggested that all who fought in the war were equally victims, but since the focus in the 08/15 films is on the unit commanded by Asch inevitably the impression is given that it was German soldiers who were the primary victims of the war. The term 08/15 refers to a type of German machine gun used in World War I that was manufactured in such quantities that \"08/15\" (German: Nullachtf\u00fcnfzehn) became German Army slang for anything was standard issue, which implied that Asch and the soldiers under his command were Everyman characters of the war on the Eastern Front. In Der Arzt von Stalingrad (The Doctor from Stalingrad) of 1958, dealing with German POWs in the Soviet Union, the Germans are portrayed as more civilized, humane and intelligent than the Soviets, who are shown for the most part as Mongol savages who brutalized the German prisoners.Bartov wrote that the portrayal of the Soviet guards as mostly Asian shows disturbing affinities to war-time Nazi propaganda, where the Red Army was often described as \"the Asiatic horde\". A recurring theme in Der Arzt von Stalingrad was that the German soldiers were being punished for crimes that they had not committed. In the 1959 film Hunde, wolt ihr ewig leben? (Dogs, do you want to live forever?), which deals with the Battle of Stalingrad, the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldiers in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust. Bartov noted that the clear impression that these films give is that the average German soldier who fought on the Eastern Front was a hero worthy of the highest admiration.This period also saw a number of films that depicted the military resistance to Hitler. In Des Teufels General (The Devil's General) of 1954, Bartov commented that in this film, the German officer corps is shown as a group of fundamentally noble and honourable men who happened to be serving an evil regime made up of a small gang of gangsterish misfits totally unrepresentative of German society, which served to exculpate both the officer corps and by extension German society.Bartov also wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army's massive co-operation with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941 during its march across the Ukraine. Likewise, Bartov commented that German films tended to dwell on the suffering of the 6th Army during the Battle of Stalingrad and its aftermath without reflecting on the fact that it was the Germans who invaded the Soviet Union and that the Russians were fighting to defend their country.Only with Jenseits des Krieges (released in the US as East of War) in 1996, a documentary directed by Ruth Beckermann dealing with the public's reaction to the exhibition \"War of Extermination\" in Vienna in 1995, did a German film admit to Wehrmacht war crimes being commonplace instead of an exception to the rule. Some veterans in Jenseits des Krieges denied that the German Army committed any war crimes at all while others express relief at long last that the truth has been told. One critic wrote of the veterans in Jenseits des Krieges that \"Some are sorry for their brutality, while others rationalize such acts as shooting POWs, raping women and butchering Jewish people as part of what soldiers were expected to do\".\n\n\n=== Wehrmachtsausstellung ===\n\nThe Wehrmachtsausstellung (German: German Army exhibition) was the name for two exhibitions focusing on war crimes of the Wehrmacht committed on the Eastern Front from 1941 to 1944. They ran from 1995 to 1999 in the original form, and 2001 to 2004 in a revised form. The exhibitions were arranged by Hannes Heer and travelled to over 33 German and Austrian cities. They were instrumental in breaking down the Myth of the clean Wehrmacht in Germany.\n\n\n=== Exhibition about the Wehrmacht in Poland in 1939 ===\nThe Wehrmachtsausstellung only covered the German presence in the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945 and excluded the German occupation of Poland after September 1939. The Polish exhibition \"Gr\u00f6\u00dfte H\u00e4rte ... Verbrechen der Wehrmacht in Polen September/Oktober 1939\", a cooperative effort of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance and the German Historical Institute Warsaw was presented on 1 September 2004, in Poland. A German version was presented in 2005. It was scheduled to be shown in Nuremberg at the Documentation Center of the Nazi Party Rallying Grounds from 1 September 2007 to early 2008.\n\n\n== Analysis of photos and letters ==\n\nThe attitude of German soldiers towards atrocities committed on Jews and Poles in World War II was also studied using photographs and correspondence left after the war. Photographs serve as a valuable source of knowledge; taking them and making albums about the persecution of Jews was a popular custom among German soldiers. These pictures are not the official propaganda of the German state but represent personal experience. Their overall attitude is antisemitic.\nGerman soldiers as well as police members took pictures of Jewish executions, deportations, humiliation and the abuse to which they were also subjected. According to researchers, pictures indicate the consent of the photographers to the abuses and murders committed. \"This consent is the result of several factors, including the anti-Semitic ideology and prolonged, intensive indoctrination\". Archival evidence as to the reaction to policies of racial extermination can also be traced in various letters that survived the war. Many of these archived letters from Wehrmacht soldiers often reflect the intensive indoctrination soldiers underwent. The following quote is from a letter written by a noncommissioned officer in the Wehrmacht who wrote home from the Russian front in 1941: The German people is deeply indebted to the Fuehrer, because if these animals, our enemies here, had reached Germany, murders of a nature not yet witnessed in the world would have occurred ... No newspaper can describe what we have seen. It verges on the unbelievable, and even the Middle Ages do not compare with what has transpired here. Reading Der Stuermer and observing its photos give only a limited impression of what we have seen here and of the crimes committed here by the Jews.\nJudith Levin and Daniel Uziel state that this type of writing and opinion was very common in correspondence left by German soldiers, especially on the Eastern Front.\nOther samples of German soldiers' letters were sent home and copied during the war by a special Polish Home Army cell that infiltrated the German postal system. These letters have been analyzed by historians and the picture they paint is similar to views expressed by Levin and Uziel. Many soldiers wrote openly about the extermination of Jews and were proud of it. Support for \"untermensch\" and \"master race\" concepts were also part of the attitude expressed by German soldiers. Presented examples reflecting this trend include samples such as:\n\nI'm one of those who are decreasing [the] number of partisans. I put them against the wall and everyone gets a bullet in his head, [a] very merry and interesting job.\n...My point of view: this nation deserves only the knaut, only by it can they be educated; a part of them already experienced that; others still try to resist. Yesterday I had [the] possibility to see 40 partisans, something like that I had never encountered before. I became convinced that we are the masters, others are untermenschen.\nMuch more evidence of such trends and thoughts among Wehrmacht soldiers exists and is subject to research by historians.The historians responsible for the exhibition assume that the anti-Semitic climate and propaganda in Nazi Germany had an immense impact on the entire population and emphasize the importance of the indoctrination.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wehrmacht war crimes at Wikimedia Commons",

    "Rare biosphere": "Rare biosphere refers to a large number of rare species of microbial life, i.e. bacteria, archaea and fungi, that can be found in very low concentrations in an environment.\n\n\n== Microbial ecosystems ==\n\nChanges in the biodiversity of an ecosystem, whether marine or terrestrial, may affect its efficiency and function. Climate change or other anthropogenic perturbations can decrease productivity and disrupt global biogeochemical cycles. The possible ramifications of such changes are not well characterized or understood, and up to a point redundancy in an ecosystem may protect it from disruption.The dynamics of microbial ecosystems are tightly coupled to biogeochemical processes. For example, in the marine microbial loop, bacteria decompose organics and recycle nutrients such as nitrogen for other organisms such as phytoplankton to use. A reduction in recycled nitrogen would limit the production rate of phytoplankton, in turn limiting the growth of grazers, with effects throughout the food web and nitrogen cycle. To gauge such effects, a base line of microbial diversity is needed. The species of rare biosphere can offer the gene pool that can be activated under changing conditions, thus keeping the ecosystem functional.  Members of the rare biosphere have been recognised as important drivers of many key ecosystem functions, for example providing bioavailable nitrogen in marine and soil environment.\n\n\n== Detection methods ==\nPrevious attempts to characterize in situ abundance of different microbial species in specific environment have been made through culturing and molecular biology techniques. Culturing produces a very narrow picture of some of the rarer species present, especially when studying an environment where only less than 0,1% of all microbes are cultivable with standard methods. Molecular biology techniques, such as Sanger sequencing, results in a much broader scope but highlights the more abundant species present. Neither of these techniques capture all of the diversity present. The current state of the art practice is the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques, pioneered by Dr. Mitchell Sogin of the Marine Biological Laboratory. This method has broadened the scope of biodiversity, with the discovery of the rare biosphere.  High throughput sequencing, or \u201ctag sequencing\u201d, divides unique rRNA gene (or other target gene) tag sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based upon similarities in the DNA code of the sequenced gene region. Both Sanger, shotgun sequencing, and tag sequencing organize sequences into OTUs. However, it is the resolution that tag sequencing provides that sets it apart from other methods, resulting from the increased efficiency in serial analysis. This efficiency increase is made possible through the use of internal primer sequences resulting in restriction digest overhanging sequences.  Though OTUs provide a  means of distinguishing the possible number of phylogenetic groups, it is not possible to deduce phylogenetic relationships based upon OTU\u2019s. Tags associated with OTUs must be cross-referenced with gene banks, in order for tags to be phylotyped and relationships established.The result of tag sequencing has been to produce orders of magnitude larger estimates of OTUs present in ecosystems, producing a long tail on species abundance curves. This long tail accounts for less than 0.1% of the abundant species in a particular ecosystem. At the same time it represents thousands of populations accounting for most of the phylogenetic diversity in an ecosystem. This low-abundance high-diversity group is the rare biosphere. Using this method, Sogin et al.\u2019s study of microbial diversity in North Atlantic deep water produced an estimate of 5266 different taxa. This is particularly dramatic considering that previous studies employing more traditional PCR cloning techniques have resulted in estimates of up to 500.\n\n\n== Ecological role ==\nConsidering their low abundance, members of the rare biosphere may represent ancient and persistent taxa. As these less abundant species are limited in number, viral infection and ultimately death by lysis is more unlikely as the viruses depend on high concentrations of host organisms to persist. Additionally, being less abundant implies to limited growth, and being on the smaller end of the cell size spectrum. This limits the likelihood of death by ingestion, as grazers prefer larger or more active microbes. It is important to note that just because these taxa are \u201crare\u201d now does not mean that under previous conditions in our planet\u2019s history they were \u201crare\u201d. These taxa could be have been episodically abundant, resulting in either global changes in biogeochemical cycles or a small change of the conditions in their current environment.  Given the persistence of these taxa under the right conditions they have the potential to dominate, and become the more abundant taxa. The occurrence of such conditions may occur on many temporal scales. It may be possible that some rare taxa dominate only during anomalous years, such as during El Ni\u00f1o. Change in abundance may occur on a seasonal scale. Global climate change may provide some of these rare taxa with the conditions necessary to increase in abundance. Even in their low abundance, taxa belonging to the rare biosphere may be affecting global biogeochemical cycles. For example, recent evidence implicates that a rare minority may be responsible for fixing more cumulative nitrogen than the abundant majority of microbial cells in marine environment.A subtle and less direct manner the rare biosphere may be affecting ecosystems, in terms of biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles, is by acting as an unlimited source of genetic diversity and material. Currently, a lot of discussion and investigations are ongoing on how microbial communities present resilience after environmental perturbation or catastrophe and how closely related species may present unique and novel genetic attributes compared to near relatives.  The rare biosphere could be seen as a seed bank, transferring genes resulting in fitter recombinants that rise to become the dominant majority.\n\n\n== Biogeography and distribution ==\nThe rare biosphere has been studied in numerous different environments, including seas, lakes, soils and even deep bedrock. There is some debate concerning the distribution of taxa within the rare biosphere. Taxa within this group at a given site may be in the process of dispersal. Studies in the Arctic seabed identified thermophilic bacteria, arriving through mechanisms of dispersal, that could not be metabolically active. Once these populations, such as the thermophilic bacteria in the Arctic, reach a suitable niche they will again become metabolically active and increase in abundance. This requires that one view these populations as non-discrete, not endemic to any one particular body of water. Alternatively, studies suggest that given the biogeography of rare taxa the idea of the rare biosphere being the product of dispersal seems unlikely. A study in the Arctic Ocean on the biogeography of the rare biosphere found that between parcels of water within that ocean, the rare biosphere presented a large amount of diversity. This suggests that populations within the rare biosphere experience evolutionary forces specific to the location they are found, such as selection, speciation, and extinction. Also, given the fact that many rare taxa cannot be identified in gene repositories, it seems unlikely that they abundant elsewhere.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDeep biosphere\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

MAF active personnel is 110,000 and the reservist is 51,600. The Supreme Commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces is the Yang di-Pertuan Agong who is the King of Malaysia.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nMalaysia's armed forces were created from the unification of military forces which arose during the first half of the 20th century when Malaya and Singapore were the subjects of British colonial rule before Malaya achieved independence in 1957. The primary objective of the armed forces in Malaysia is to defend the country's sovereignty and protect it from any and all types of threats.It is responsible for assisting civilian authorities to overcome all international threats, preserve public order, assist in natural disasters and participate in national development programs. It is also sustaining and upgrading its capabilities in the international sphere to uphold the national foreign policy of being involved under the guidance of the United Nations (UN).\n\n\n== Theater of operation ==\nThe main theaters of operations were within Malaysian borders, primarily to fight an insurgency led by the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) in what was known as the Emergency. The only foreign incursion of Malaysian territory in modern times were in World War II by Japan (Malaya was then not a unified political entity and consisted of the British Crown Colony of the Straits Settlements, and the British protected Federated Malay States and Unfederated Malay States) and during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation by Indonesia under the leadership of President Sukarno. Operations on foreign soil have mainly been peacekeeping operations under the auspices of the United Nations.\n\nFirst Emergency (1948\u20131960)\nAn insurrection and guerrilla war of the Malayan National Liberation Army organised by the CPM against the British and Malayan administration.\nMoro attacks on Malaysia (Part of the Piracy in the Sulu Sea) (1962\u2013present)\nCongo Peacekeeping Mission (1960\u20131962)\nA contingent of 1,947 personnel were dispatched as part of the United Nations Operation in the Congo or ONUC. This contingent was known as the Malayan Special Force to the Congo and their experiences there were later recounted through the drawings of the cartoonist, Rejabhad.\nSarawak Communist Insurgency (1963\u20131990)\nAn insurrection and guerrilla war of the Sarawak Communist Organisation (from 1971, the North Kalimantan Communist Party or NKCP) against the British and Malaysian governments to establish an independent nation comprising the states of Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei. The insurgency ended when the NKCP signed a peace treaty with the Malaysian government in 1990.\nIndonesia-Malaysia confrontation (1963\u20131966)\nAn intermittent armed conflict between Malaysia and Indonesia with skirmishes mainly occurring in Sarawak and Sabah in the island of Borneo. In 1964, armed raids were made on Peninsular Malaysia. Combat eased with the deposing of Indonesia's President Sukarno in 1965 by the Indonesian army and the conflict was declared over by both sides in 1966.\nCommunist insurgency in Malaysia (1968\u201389)\nA low level resurgence of insurgent activity by the armed elements of the CPM from sanctuaries in the Malaysian-Thai border. The insurgency was only ended after the CPM signed a peace treaty with the Governments of Malaysia and Thailand on 2 December 1989.\nIran/Iraq Border (1988\u20131991)\nParticipated as part of the UN Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group (UNIIMOG) to supervise the Iran\u2013Iraq War ceasefire.\nNamibia (1989\u20131990)\nContributed a battalion to the UN Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) to supervise Namibia's elections and transition to independence.\nWestern Sahara (1991\u2013present)\nA contingent of observers under the Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) to help implement a ceasefire between the Polisario Front & Morocco and help promote referendum on area's future.\nAngola (1991\u20131995)\nA contingent was sent under the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II (UNAVEM II) to enforce the ceasefire in Angolan civil war.\nIraq/Kuwait Border (1992\u20132003)\nA contingent was sent under the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM) to monitor the demilitarised zone along the Iraq-Kuwait border, deter border violations and report on any hostile action.\nCambodia (1992\u20131993)\nAn observer team was sent under the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) to aid in the administration of Cambodia and to organise and run elections.\nBosnia and Herzegovina (1993\u20131998)\nA peacekeeping contingent known as MALBATT Command (Malaysia Battalion) was sent initially under the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) from 1993 to 1995 with deployments at Konjic, Jablanica and Pazari\u0107 in Had\u017ei\u0107i. Following the Dayton Agreement, forces were redeployed as MALCON Command (Malaysia Contingent) under the NATO led Implementation Force (IFOR) in Operation Joint Endeavor with deployments at Livno, Glamo\u010d and Kupres. MALCON further participated as part of the NATO led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) until 1998. Up to 8,000 troops were eventually deployed in this theatre of operations.\nLiberia (1993\u20131997)\nAn observer team of 3 officers was sent under the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) to support the efforts of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Liberian National Transitional Government to implement peace agreements signed between the warring parties in Liberia.\nSomalia (1993\u20131994)\nA contingent known as MALBATT was sent under the United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II) to take appropriate action, including enforcement measures, to establish throughout Somalia a secure environment for humanitarian assistance. During its deployment, MALBATT was involved in the Battle of Mogadishu which saw 1 personnel killed in action and 7 others wounded in action during the relief operations to aid the surrounded troops of the United States' Task Force Ranger. On 18 January 1994, Lieutenant General Abu Samah Bin Abu Bakar was appointed the Commander of UNOSOM II forces. His appointment also saw the United Nations revise the mandate of UNOSOM II to stop using \"coercive methods\" in the discharge of their duties while retaining \"some capability to defend its personnel if circumstances so warrant.\"\nMozambique (1993\u20131995)\nA team of observers were sent under the United Nations Operations in Mozambique (ONUMOZ).\nLahad Datu standoff (2013)\nDeployed in South Lebanon on peace keeping role at present after the withdrawal of Israeli Military forces early 2007 (Invasion of South Lebanon by Israeli Military). Unit also consist of GGK, PASKAL, PASKAU and PARA elements.\nDeployed a contingent called Malaysian Medical Team (MASMEDTIM) to Chaman, Pakistan to treat refugees from Afghanistan during the US invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.\nDeployed approximately a brigade-sized force on islands surrounding Sabah waters in Ops Pasir to prevent the recurrence of 2000 Sipadan kidnappings.\nDeployed a contingent to Acheh after the tsunami disaster in 2004.\nDeployed MASMEDTIM to Pakistan during the 2005 quake.\nDeployed in Southern Philippines as a part of monitoring force agreed upon by both the Philippine Government and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).\nDeployed in East Timor/East Leste together with Australian, Portuguese and New Zealand forces at the request of East Timor Government. The first team of 25 soldiers from 10 Para Brigade, Royal Intelligence Corp and Commando Regiment were deployed on a fact-finding mission before being reinforced by another 209 soldiers. (as at 27 May 2006)Other limited participation under UNPKO are United Nations International Police Force (UNIPTF) since December 1995; United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) since June 1999; United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) since October 1999; United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) since September 1999 and United Nations Organisation Mission in Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) since February 2000. 18 Malaysian Armed Forces personnel have been killed during UN peacekeeping operations.\n\n\n== Present development ==\n\nMalaysian defence requirements are assigned to the Malaysian Armed Forces (Angkatan Tentera Malaysia \u2013 ATM). The armed forces has three branches, the Malaysian Army (Tentera Darat Malaysia \u2013 TDM), Royal Malaysian Navy (Tentera Laut Diraja Malaysia \u2013 TLDM) and the Royal Malaysian Air Force (Tentera Udara Diraja Malaysia \u2013 TUDM). Malaysia does not have conscription, and the required minimum age for voluntary military service is 18.In the early 1990s, Malaysia undertook a major program to expand and modernise its armed forces. However, budgetary constraints imposed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis held many of the procurement. The recent economic recovery may lead to relaxation of budgetary constraints on the resumption of major weapons purchases. In October 2000, the Defence Minister also announced a review of national defence and security policy to bring it up to date. The review addressed new security threats that have emerged in the form of low intensity conflicts, such as the kidnapping of Malaysians and foreigners from resort islands located off the east coast of the state of Sabah and risk rising territory dispute with several neighbour countries. Currently, 1.4% of Malaysia's GDP is spent on the military, which employs 1.23% of Malaysia's manpower. Dr Kogila Balakrishnan is the head of the Defence Industry.\n\n\n=== Malaysian Army ===\n\nSince the recovery from the 1997 economic crisis, the army's modernisation programme has gained momentum. The acquisition of Main Battle Tank (MBT), Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC), Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) and modern artillery make the army as one of the potent power in the region.\n\n\n=== Royal Malaysian Navy ===\n\nFollowing the completion of the New Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV) program, Malaysia now moved to the next program called Second Generation Patrol Vessel (SGPV). Malaysia is also looking to purchase more submarine as well as a batch of Littoral Mission Ship (LMS) and Multi Role Support Ship (MRSS). In addition, an upgrade programme and Service Life Extension Programme (SLEP) for the old navy's ship will keep the fleet modern with the latest technology needed.\n\n\n=== Royal Malaysian Air Force ===\n\nRMAF has traditionally looked to the West for its purchases, primarily to the United States and Europe. However, limitation imposed by the United States on \"new technology\" to the region made RMAF consider purchases from Russia and other non-traditional sources. Currently, RMAF operates a unique mix of American, European and Russian-made aircraft.\n\n\n=== Forming of Marine Corps ===\nDefence Minister Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said in a statement on 10 October 2013, Malaysia is planning on establishing a marine corps for amphibious operation. The marine will be drawn from all three services and the bulk of it is from one of the three parachute battalions of the 10 Paratrooper Brigade which will be re-designated as a marine battalion. The 9th Royal Malay Regiment (para) and 8th Royal Ranger Regiment (para) have both conducted amphibious warfare training as a secondary mission such as CARAT exercise with the US Marine Corps (USMC) and others amphibious exercise also conducted with other foreign armed forces.\n\n\n== Defence industry ==\nAfter independence, Malaysia moved forward by establishing and developing their own defence industry. Malaysia has improved their defence industry through their defence companies by locally manufactured and produced weapons such as ammunitions, rifles, armoured cars, warships and light aircraft including unmanned aerial vehicle for the armed forces. DefTech, Mildef International Technologies and Weststar Defence Industries are the local company that emphasizes in the maintenance and manufacturing of military land vehicle and automotive sector while Sapura company focus more in military electronics and systems integration such as communication systems, tactical systems, command and control systems, training and simulation systems and surveillance systems. In January 2021, Mildef International Technologies has launched its new Mildef Tarantula HMAV intended for local market and export. Another local company, Cendana Auto also introduces its new Cendana Auto Rover which is ready to deliver to the Malaysian Army.\nAs a country with vast maritime area, Malaysia has long had a great shipbuilding industry since the Malacca Sultanate empire where this land had been the main shipbuilding area in the region. Nowadays, Malaysia owns a lot of shipbuilding companies in a country with great expertise and facilities. Through local companies such as Boustead Heavy Industries Corporation, Destini Berhad, TH Heavy Engineering and Gading Marine, Malaysia able to locally built their own major surface combatants and combat boats with the latest and state of the art technology. In addition, local companies such as Labuan Shipyard and Engineering, Malaysia Marine and Heavy Engineering and others also able to executes minor and major maintenance and overhaul to the naval grade vessels locally without need to send it to the oversea. Some of this great achievement can be seen when Malaysia succeed completed its Scorpene-class submarine major overhaul and upgrade program locally by Boustead where this program done at RMN submarine base in Labuan, Sabah. Malaysia also already export their naval vessels to the foreign navy such as Shin Yang-made Al-Quwaisat-class LST to the United Arab Emirates navy and Northern Shipyard-made Manta MkII-class fast interdiction combat boat to the Nigerian navy where this combat boats marketed under the Singapore-based company, Suncraft Private Limited.In the aerospace sector, it is no doubt Malaysia is one of the aerospace hubs in the region. AIROD is some of the only outside company that received certificate from United States (US) based defence company, Lockheed Martin as the C-130 MRO centre outside the US. In 2015, United States Marine Corps awarded AIROD to do the MRO works onto its 13 units of C-130 that based in Japan. Besides C-130, AIROD also owned an expertise in serving other type of commercial and military aircraft and had served to the customer across the region. Like AIROD, other local aerospace company namely ATSC also play an important role in aerospace industry in Malaysia. This company focus more in serving MRO for Russian-built aircraft such as Sukhoi Su-30, MiG-29 and  Mil Mi-17. In 2017, ATSC was awarded a contract to do a major overhaul and upgrade for the RMAF Sukhoi Su-30 MKM fleet. Since 1990s, Malaysia through SME Aerospace and CTRM has been manufacturing aircraft components such as wing parts, nacelles, composites structures and helicopter parts for the Airbus company. This aerostructure part includes for A320, A330, A350, A380, A400 and Airbus helicopter. Other than that, SME Aerospace also manufactured pylon for BAE Systems Hawk AJT for the worldwide customer. Although Malaysia don't built major aircraft locally or with partnership, but Malaysia already had an experience in building the light aircraft such as SME Aero Tiga and CTRM Eagle Aircraft Eagle 150. In addition, CTRM also had built their indigenous unmanned aerial vehicle called CTRM Aludra.In 1969, Malaysia set up their firearms manufacturing company, SME Ordnance. Started with the humble step by manufacturing ammunition locally, now SME Ordnance able to manufacturing high-tech firearms. In 1991, SME Ordnance acquired a licence to manufacture Austria-made Styer AUG rifles locally. By 2001, SME Ordnance moving forward by acquiring a licence to manufacture US-made M4 Carbine rifles locally. Both locally manufactured Styer and M4 rifles currently uses by Malaysian Armed Forces and other government agencies. Beside that, SME Ordnance also provides the wide range of NATO standard ammunitions starting from 5.56 mm to 155 mm calibre, mines, explosions and rockets. Another local firearms company Aegis Malinnov also developed indigenous pistols called Malinnov M1P intended to be uses by Malaysian government agencies.Malaysia also had their own defence technology research statutory board. Science Technology Research Institute for Defence (STRIDE) is the statutory board under the Ministry of Defence (Malaysia). Its responsible for performing research and development related to the defence technology for the Malaysian Ministry of Defence and Malaysian Armed Forces.\n\n\n== International action ==\nThe Five Power Defence Arrangement (FPDA) between Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom is a regional security initiative which has been in place for more than 45 years. It involves joint military exercises held between the five countries.Malaysia also actively takes part in international exercise such as CARAT, RIMPAC and COPE. Joint exercises and war games also been held with Brunei, Indonesia,France and the United States. Besides that, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have agreed to host joint security force exercises to secure their maritime border and tackle issues such as illegal immigration, piracy and smuggling.Previously there are fears that extremist militants activities in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines and southern Thailand could spill over into Malaysia. Due to this, Malaysia began to increase its border security.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nMalaysian Army\nRoyal Malaysian Navy\nRoyal Malaysian Air Force\nMalaysia Coast Guard\nRoyal Malaysia Police\nRoyal Johor Military Force\nJoint Forces Command\nMalaysian National Service\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRobert Karniol, 'Country Briefing: Malaysia,' Jane's Defence Weekly, 25 November 1995, p. 25\u201340\n\n\n== External links ==\nMalaysian Armed Forces Headquarters Website Archived 5 May 2014 at the Wayback Machine\nPerspective from a military personnel in The Liaison\n(malaysiandefence.com)",

The short was released on March 15, 1960, and stars Sylvester and Sylvester Jr.This cartoon was included in the 1982 feature film Bugs Bunny's 3rd Movie: 1001 Rabbit Tales.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nIn a cottage live the Three Cats: Sylvester (father cat), Mrs. Sylvester (mother cat), and Sylvester Jr. (baby cat alias \"Spoiled Brat\" as Sylvester calls him). Sylvester finds his porridge is too hot and Mrs. Sylvester finds her porridge too cold, but Sylvester Jr. complains on why they are having to eat porridge instead of mice like other cats. Sylvester suggests that they go for a walk in the woods to wait for the porridge to cool down (commenting \"Now where have I heard that before?\").\nWhile they are away, Goldimouse (a mouse with curly blonde locks) enters the house through a tiny door, spies the porridge, and eats it. Afterwards, Goldimouse feels sleepy and tries all three beds and finds Sylvester Jr.'s just right, so Goldimouse takes it and goes to sleep.\nLater on, Sylvester and his family return from their walk and discover Goldimouse's handiwork.  While going through the whole \"Somebody's been eating my porridge\" and \"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed\" bit, Sylvester Jr. is relieved that his porridge is all gone and that the intruder in his bed is a mouse. When he says this, Goldimouse wakes up, freaks out at the sight of Sylvester Jr. and turns to Sylvester for help, but then notices that he, too, is a cat and escapes out the tiny door.\nAt his son's insistence, Sylvester tries to get Goldimouse out of the mousehole, but she thwarts his multiple attempts. After Sylvester's latest failure to rid Goldimouse with explosives, Sylvester brings Junior his breakfast, consisting of a bowl of porridge. He dumps it on Junior's head, indicating that he has had enough of Junior's spoiled attitude.\n\n\n== Voice cast ==\nMel Blanc as Sylvester / Sylvester Jr.\nJune Foray as Narrator / Mrs. Sylvester / Goldimouse (uncredited)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nGoldimouse and the Three Cats at IMDb",

    "Gentlemen Marry Brunettes": "Gentlemen Marry Brunettes is a 1955 American Technicolor musical romantic comedy film directed by Richard Sale, who co-wrote the screenplay with Mary Loos, based on the 1927 novel But Gentlemen Marry Brunettes by Anita Loos, aunt of Mary Loos. The film stars Jane Russell and Jeanne Crain. It was produced by Sale and Bob Waterfield (Russell's husband), with Robert Bassler as executive producer. \nAnita Loos was the author of the 1925 novel and 1926 play Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, which had been adapted into the 1953 film of the same name, starring Russell and Marilyn Monroe. The studio attempted to repeat the formula, with Russell returning but Jeanne Crain stepping in for a presumably otherwise engaged Monroe (both women played new characters). Alan Young, Scott Brady, and Rudy Vallee also appear. This film was not as well received as its predecessor.\nThe choreography was by Jack Cole, who had also contributed to the Gentlemen Prefer Blondes film. The dance ensemble includes the young Gwen Verdon.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\nBonnie and Connie Jones, played by Jane Russell and Jeanne Crain, are two sisters that live in New York working on Broadway. They are known as the second generation of the Jones sisters, taking the name after their mother, Mitzi Jones, who also performed popularly with her sister, Mimi Jones.\nBonnie and Connie are often offered engagements by men. Connie refuses these New Yorkers every time, while her sister Bonnie seemingly cannot say no to all these men\u2019s offerings. This initiates fights between the men outside the sisters\u2019 shows, and these situations embarrass Connie for being related to Bonnie.\nThe sisters fight about Bonnie\u2019s weakness to refuse these men. Connie wants her sister to promise her to refuse them for the sake of their career. However, the moment the sisters reconcile, a messenger knocks on their door with an offered Paris agreement by David Action to partake shows around France.\nThe sisters immediately agree, and promise each other to focus on the success of their career rather than focusing on desperate men looking for marriage. When they arrive in Paris, they are welcomed by Charlie Biddle and David Action, played by Alan Young and Scott Brady, who will later become the sisters\u2019 love interests.\nThe men are surprised by the difference between the first generation and the second generation of the Jones sisters. They notice that Bonnie and Connie lack the lush living style of their mother and act more sophisticated. The sisters claim that they do not own a lot because of financial problems; it took them three months of savings to buy an average looking dress for their shows.\nThe girls open their luggage to get ready for a cocktail party; however, their only dress is a cheetah printed dress which to Rudy is not appropriate to wear in the afternoon for the press. They want to be able to show off the new Jones sisters properly, and therefore, they remodel the dresses to impress Paris just like the first generation of the Jones sisters. The cocktail party goes extremely well. Men are dancing and the girls have the attention of the whole room. Their popularity and names go all around Paris, which helps their career.\nThe next day, the Jones sisters want to tour the city of Paris and plead David and Charlie to show them around. They separate into two groups, Connie leaving with Charlie and Bonnie leaving with David. These quickly turn into dates in the city of Paris, as both couples share kisses and reveal their attraction towards one another. However, Bonnie\u2019s relationship with David complicates because David fears to give himself away to another person. He would rather stay a bachelor, which is what he calls himself.\nBut as love is growing between the two groups, so are the sisters\u2019 career. Parisian casinos desire to have them perform for their nighttime show. But the girls refuse most of them as the casino provides them with vulgar and lacking attire. For their own dignity, Bonnie and Connie refuse to show their bodies off for the enjoyment of others. Although most of the casinos refuse to give them proper attire, the girls find their way around this and hide their bodies from the audience using a hat with long feathers the casino provided them with. They not only performed and received their well-earned money, but received more attention in France, allowing them to perform in Monte Carlo the next evening.\nThe girls perform beautifully at their next and unexpectedly last show of the movie. Their mother, Mitzi, is unhappy with the circumstances her daughter are in, and she forces them to come home to New York with her. After her show days, Bonnie and Connie have claimed that their mother has raised them strictly. She especially does not want her daughters to display themselves vulgarly, which is why she forcefully brings them back home.\nGrabbing them by the ears, she puts them in a taxi car leaving the Monte Carlo Casino. After seeing the love of their lives leave, David and Charlie know that they cannot bear living the rest of their lives without the sisters and they decide to chase after them. The movie ends with Charlie and David running to the boat taking off for New York looking for the Jones sisters. The moment they meet again, Charlie proposes to Connie, and David pleads to be forgiven by Bonnie for refusing her in the beginning of their relationship. Bonnie, of course, forgives David who then takes action and proposes to her. The movie ends with two newly and happily engaged couples taking off on a boat to New York.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nJane Russell as Bonnie Jones / Mimi Jones\nJeanne Crain as Connie Jones / Mitzi Jones (singing voice was dubbed by Anita Ellis)\nAlan Young as Charlie Biddle / Mrs. Biddle / Mr. Henry Biddle\nScott Brady as David Action (singing voice was dubbed by Robert Farnon)\nRudy Vallee as himself\nGuy Middleton as Earl of Wickenwave\nEric Pohlmann as M.

    "Badri": "Badri is a 2001 Indian Tamil-language sports comedy film directed by P. A. Arun Prasad.  The film stars Vijay in the titular role as a college brat who turns into a kickboxer to prove himself, whereas Bhumika plays the lead female. Monal, Vivek, Riyaz Khan and Bhupinder Singh play supporting roles. The film's soundtrack was composed by Ramana Gogula, while the background score was composed by Devi Sri Prasad. It is the official remake of the director's own Telugu movie Thammudu which was based on the 1992 Hindi movie Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikander which in turn was based on the 1979 English movie Breaking Away. Filming began in August 2000 and was completed by March 2001. The film had its theatrical release on 12 April 2001. The film completed 100 days theatrical run. India Today listed the film under top ten films of Vijay. It received positive response, and became a commercial successful venture at the box office.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nSri Badrinatha Moorthy aka \"Badri\" is a happy-go-lucky youth who spends his days roaming around with his friends Azhagu, Howrah, and Joot, ogling girls and repeatedly failing his exams. His father, Viswanathan, a cafe owner, is disgusted with his irresponsibility and constantly chides him. His older brother Vetri, who is a college-level kickboxer and Viswanathan's favourite son, on the other hand, dotes on him. Janaki, aka \"Jaanu\", who is Badri's neighbour and childhood friend, is in love with him, but the feeling is one-sided as Badri mainly considers her as a source of money and cars; Badri constantly borrows large amounts of money from Jaanu as well as expensive cars from her father's garage to impress girls.\nOne day, Badri meets Mamathi, who is a rich college girl, and poses as a wealthy industrialist's son in order to impress and love her. Mamathi falls for Badri's lies and soon expresses her love to him. But when she finds out the truth, she breaks up with him and insults him in front of Viswanathan. When Viswanathan further finds out that Badri has taken large amounts of money from Jaanu, he disowns Badri, tired of his antics.\nBadri, who is now homeless, finds support from Jaanu, who advises him to be more responsible and redeem himself in Viswanathan's eyes. He realises the love Jaanu has for him and begins to reform himself. Meanwhile, Vetri is attacked and seriously injured by his kickboxing arch-rival Rohit, who happens to be Mamathi's new boyfriend and Badri's enemy as well, thus ruling him out for the final match of the inter-collegiate kickboxing championship against Rohit. Badri decides to fight for Vetri by taking his place in the final and trains hard for it. Finally he defeats Rohit in the final, thus winning the kickboxing championship. He dedicates the trophy to Vetri, reconciles with Viswanathan, and reciprocates Jaanu's love.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\nBadri, produced by Sri Venkateswara Art Films, was announced in August 2000 and was slated to be the remake of the Telugu film Thammudu, starring Pawan Kalyan. Arun Prasad, who directed the original, reprises his role, as did the composer Ramana Gogula. Most of the other technicians were also taken from Tollywood. Art director G. K. hired 200 technicians to create a high tech complex in Vahini studios for the film. When first announced, it was reported that Vijay would essay dual lead roles, although this claim later proved to be untrue. Bhupinder Singh was also selected to reprise his role from the original version as Rohit, the antagonist.During the filming of a pivotal scene in the \"Travelling Soldier\" song, Vijay allowed a car to run over his fingers, and the shot was canned with three cameras, with the scene attracting media attention. Martial arts expert Shihan Hussaini helped with the production and features in the film in a guest appearance. Other scenes were shot at Amir Mahal in Chennai.The film teamed up with Coca-Cola for their publicity campaign after Vijay had signed on to the soft drink company as a brand ambassador.\n\n\n== Release ==\nThe film released on 12 April 2001 and ran for 100 days in theatres. The Hindu reported that the film Badri clearly reveals the diligence and sincerity of Vijay. But would these alone make a film wholesome?\" and that Monal \"needs to work on her expressions\". A reviewer from entertainment portal Ananda Vikatan rated the film 40 out of 100. Tamil Movies Cafe wrote \"Badri moves at a fairly neat pace in the earlier part, lags a little later, and then picks up speed towards the end.\"\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack of the film was composed by Ramana Gogula who composed for the original film and notably remains his first and only Tamil film he had worked so far, was well received by the audience. The lyrics were penned by Palani Bharathi.\n\nTracklist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBadri at IMDb",

    "Endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer": "Endocrine therapy is a common treatment for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. However, resistance to this therapy can develop, leading to relapse and progression of disease. This highlights the need for new strategies to combat this resistance.\n\n\n== Breast Cancer Overview ==\n\n\n=== Hormonal Status in Breast Cancer ===\nIn the UK, breast cancer is the most common cancer type, affecting around 1 in 8 women. It can be loosely divided into non-invasive, where the cancer is localised to the ducts or lobules in which it originated, or invasive, where the cancer cells have spread beyond the initial duct or lobule into the surrounding breast cancer or other part of the body. Risk factors that may predispose to breast cancer include increasing age and a family history of breast cancer. Despite the increase in incidence of breast cancer with age, there is a notable deceleration of this increase following menopause. Moreover, breast cancer risk is heightened following use of the combined oral contraceptive pill and combined HRT. Armed with this evidence that endogenous and exogenous changes in oestrogen and progesterone levels modulate the risk of breast cancer, it is apparent that hormones can play a key role in breast cancer.\nIndeed, breast tumours can express certain steroid hormone receptors, and use these to grow and proliferate. These steroid hormone receptors are the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Immunohistochemical analysis of a tumour sample, taken via biopsy or after surgery, is utilised to determine the presence of these receptors. To classify a tumour as ER or PR negative or positive, the Allred score is utilised, which takes into account both the proportion of ERs and PRs present and the overall intensity score of the staining - this method is considered controversial, however. The overexpression of HER2 is determined by immunohistochemistry, or with fluorescent in situ hybridisation in those equivocal cases where IHC does not provide a clear result.\nDifferent molecular subtypes have also been described, which loosely align with receptor status:\n\nLuminal A (ER and/or PR positive; HER2 negative)\nLuminal B (ER and/or PR positive; HER2 positive)\nHER2-enriched (ER/PR negative; HER2 positive)\nBasal like (triple negative).Additionally, cancers can be ER-/PR+ or ER+/PR-, but these are unnamed and relatively rare. The receptor status of a cancer is assessed for all breast cancers as it has important implications on prognosis of the patient. It also dictates the treatment given: cancers that do express ER are likely to respond to endocrine therapy, but this type of therapy will have no effect on triple-negative breast cancers.\n\n\n=== Mechanism of Estrogen Receptor Action ===\n75% of breast cancers are ER+. ER is a transcription factor containing a DNA-binding domain which allows binding DNA at specific sequences called estrogen response elements (EREs), defined as 5\u2019-GGTCAnnnTGACC-3\u2019, where n refers to any nucleotide. The N-terminal of the ER holds the activation function 1 (AF1) domain; the AF2 domain of the ER is contained within the ligand binding domain. The AF2 domain contains binding sites for coactivators.Estrogen is a steroid hormone and can cross the cell membrane freely. It can then bind to an ER, which is located in the cytoplasm of the cell. Upon binding, the ligand-receptor complex dimerises with another, and this homodimer moves into the nucleus. Binding of an estrogen ligand exposes a site on the AF2 domain for co-activators to attach to the ER. By recruiting coactivators and transcription factors, transcription of downstream genes, referred to as estrogen responsive genes, is initiated. These genes are of diverse function, but may potentiate aberrant cell survival and proliferation, contributing to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. For example, the ER can promote transcription of cyclin D1, an important regulator of the cell cycle. By interfering with the expression of this regulator, estrogen and estrogen receptor signalling can disrupt the cell cycle.\nEndocrine therapies interrupt this pathway, blocking the binding of the receptor to the response element and subsequent transcription of these estrogen-responsive genes. ER+/PR+ cancers have been found to show better results with administration of SERMs than ER+/PR- cancers. This trend has been found with AI therapy also, albeit in fewer studies. The biological basis of this remains unknown.\n\n\n== Endocrine Therapy Overview ==\n\n\n=== Estrogen ===\nEstrogens are responsible for the regulation of the female reproductive system and development of secondary sexual characteristics.17\u03b2-Estradiol is the biologically active form of the sex hormone known as estrogen. It is secreted by granulose cells of the ovarian follicle and the corpus luteum, and is the primary form of circulating form of estrogen.Other forms of endogenous oestrogen exist, such as estrone, estriol and estero. Esterol and estriol are primarily found in the body during pregnancy, and estrone is present during the menopause.All of the forms of estrogen found in the human body are able to bind to estrogen receptors (ER) present on cells. This initiates transcription in these cells, resulting in control of gene expression.Treatment strategies that work by blocking the effect of oestrogen on breast cancer are referred to as endocrine (or hormone) therapies. These can target hormone regulation in two distinct ways.\n\n\n=== Blocking Estrogen Synthesis ===\nFirstly, some forms of endocrine therapy can be administered to block estrogen synthesis. In pre-menopausal women, this can be achieved through surgical ovarian ablation (by oophorectomy) or chemical ovarian suppression (using luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonists, such as goserilin). In postmenopausal women, the ovaries cease to be the main source of estrogen production, with estrogen being instead synthesized from androgens in tissues of the bone, fat, and breast through the activity of the enzyme aromatase. This can be blocked through the administration of aromatase inhibitors (AI), which can be reversible inhibitors (non-steroidal) such as anastrazole and letrozole, or irreversible (steroidal) inhibitors like exemestane.\n\n\n=== Influencing the Effect of Estrogen ===\nSecondly, other endocrine therapies can directly influence the effect of estrogen in cancer cells. ER function can be chemically blocked in pre- and post-menopausal women using antiestrogens, including:\n\nSelective ER modulators (SERMs), like tamoxifen. SERMs act as partial estrogen agonists, competing with estrogen to bind ER.\nSelective ER down-regulators or degraders (SERDs), like fulvestrant. SERDs that act as full estrogen antagonists, binding to ER and leading to its degradation.\n\n\n== Endocrine Resistance Overview ==\n\n\n=== Definition of endocrine resistance ===\nThe term 'endocrine resistance' describes a resistance to estrogen signalling suppression. However, in many scientific studies endocrine resistance refers to resistance to estrogen or estrogen receptor suppression. This resistance occurs due to the development of escape pathways which provide new ways for cancer cells to survive in the presence of endocrine therapy. If a patient with ER+ breast cancer develops endocrine resistance, the endocrine therapy used to treat the cancer will no longer be effective. Approximately 30-50% of ER+ breast cancer patients will relapse as a result of endocrine resistance, proving it to be a predominant challenge in the treatment of ER+ breast cancer patients.\n\n\n=== Types of endocrine resistance ===\nThere are two types of endocrine resistance; primary and secondary. Primary resistance can also be described as de novo resistance or intrinsic resistance, in this instance the resistance existed before any treatment was initiated. Secondary resistance is acquired. This means that it occurs after some initial response to treatment due to exposure to endocrine therapy.\n\n\n=== Characterisation of endocrine resistance ===\nThe table below summarises how the two types of resistance are characterised in clinical settings.\n\n\n=== Implications of resistance ===\nEndocrine resistance in breast cancer leads to the progression of the disease and relapse. Resistance to endocrine therapy, leading to metastasis of breast cancer is one of the main reasons for death in breast cancer patients. This highlights the need for new strategies to overcome endocrine resistance and better treat ER+ breast cancer.\n\n\n== Endocrine Resistance Mechanisms ==\n\n\n=== ESR1 Modifications ===\nMutations in the ESR1 gene have been associated with the development of resistance to endocrine therapy. The ESR1 gene codes for estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2). Whilst it is still not fully understood how ER\u03b2 impacts breast cancer development, ER\u03b1  is known to have a role in tumour growth and cell survival.Point missense mutations, which are small mutations within a gene that can change the resulting protein, can lead to estrogen independence. This means that endocrine therapies blocking estrogen synthesis, such as aromatase inhibitors, lose efficacy because in a state of estrogen independence, the ER is stimulated without the need for estrogen, thus leading to constant ER activity. These mutations are rare in primary tumours, however the frequency can be up to 30x higher in metastatic lesions.Another mechanism by which modifications to the ESR1 gene can lead to endocrine therapy resistance is by the occurrence of translocations. During translocations, a fusion protein is formed between ESR1 and YAP1. YAP1 is a gene crucial for proliferation and apoptosis of cells. The creation of this fusion protein can allow the tumour to grow independent of estrogen, develop anti-estrogen resistance, have induced cell motility and constitutive expression of ER target genes.Finally, it has been shown that there can be ESR1 gene amplification of up to 37% in breast cancer patients. However as of now there is no research showing a clear correlation between this amplification and endocrine resistance.\n\n\n=== miRNA Regulators ===\nmiRNAs are non-coding sections of RNA that are involved in gene expression. It has been shown that upregulation of some of these miRNAs may be associated with the development of anti-estrogen resistance via two potential pathways. Firstly by activating alternative growth pathways and secondly by inhibition of ER expression. Some of examples of this are described below.miR-155 stimulates the STAT3 signalling pathway and this is associated with cell survival and endocrine resistance, specifically resistance to Tamoxifen. In terms of inhibition, certain miRNAs are known to inhibit key inhibitors of the P27 pathway, hence allowing it carry on unchecked. The P27 pathway is well known for causing cell proliferation in tumours, and the levels of P27 can be measured and used as a marker for Tamoxifen resistance.In contrast to this, downregulation of other miRNAs is also associated with the development of endocrine resistance. Some miRNAs act as inhibitors to ER\u03b1-36 which acts as an ER\u03b2 antagonist and an agonist of estrogen-like SERM effects. So therefore low levels of these mRNAs are associated with ER\u03b1-36 mediated resistance.Another mechanism by which down-regulation of miRNAs may be implicated in the development of endocrine therapy resistance is by leading to overexpression of CDK3 and enhanced transcriptional activity of ER.\n\n\n=== GPER ===\nGPER is a transmembrane protein that acts as an estrogen receptor and it is present in 50-60% of breast cancer cases. The cellular location of GPER seems to correlate somewhat with tumour prognosis, where cytoplasmic GPER is associated with lower grade tumours and nuclear GPER with higher rates of metastasis.The signalling pathways associated with the GPER protein involve tyrosine kinases (from the Src family). Additionally there is cross talk between the GOER and EGFR signalling pathways.Tamoxifen has been shown to increase expression of GPER by binding to its receptor. The signalling pathways initiated lead not only to tamoxifen resistance, but also a higher risk of metastasis and cell growth. The overall survival rate hence decreases for patients displaying high GPER expression.\n\n\n=== PR Expression ===\nPR (progesterone receptor) is a gene expressed in around 50% of ER+ breast cancer patients. Clinical studies have shown that ER+/PR+ cases are more sensitive to endocrine therapy than ER+/PR- cases, suggesting that the loss of PR expression is associated with the development of endocrine therapy resistance. PR levels have been shown to be downregulated when there is activation of growth factors via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.\n\n\n=== HER2 Over-expression ===\nOver-expression of HER2 is found to be present in around 30% of metastatic breast tumours and is associated with a poorer prognosis. Studies have demonstrated that there is crosstalk between HER2 and ER signalling pathways. Specifically, studies have shown there is crosstalk between HER2 and the ER co-activator A1B1 which could enhance the estrogen agonist activity of tamoxifen bound ER. Additionally HER2 has physical associations with the cell membrane ER and interactions between them have been shown to block ER initiated apoptosis.\n\n\n== Tackling Endocrine Resistance ==\nWhen tackling endocrine resistance in breast cancer, the current strategies are focused around combining hormonal agents with drugs targeting several escape pathways, as outlined in the mechanisms of endocrine resistance section. The aim is to block all the tumour survival escapes.The main approach in overcoming endocrine resistance in those breast cancers that are both ER+ and HER2+ is by using a combination of endocrine and HER2-targeting agents.In trials conducted with a combination of anti-HER2 agents and an aromatase inhibitor, significant clinical benefit and improved progression-free survival have been observed.Trastuzumab is an example of an anti-HER2 agent which mainly depresses the growth of cells which are over-expressing HER2.Many endocrine resistant breast cancers which don\u2019t respond to aromatase inhibitors still depend on ER signalling.Selective Estrogen Receptor Degraders (SERDs) can be used in these cases as they destabilize the ER and act as pure antagonists at the ER receptor. An example SERD is Fulvestrant which binds to the ER to block its dimerization and nuclear localisation. The fulvestrant-ER complex is unstable, resulting in degradation.There has also been research into the combined inhibition of the ER and EGFR. An example of a pure EGFR inhibitor is gefitinib, which has been used in phase II trials to evaluate its addition to tamoxifen in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer.The PI3K-Akt-mTOR signalling pathway and crosstalk with the ER signalling pathway is thought to be involved in the development of resistance to endocrine therapy. Therefore, studies have been done to assess the efficacy of using mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus or temsirolimus, in ER-positive breast cancers.Some preclinical and clinical studies have shown the possibility of mTOR inhibitors as a first step treatment to shrink the breast cancer tumour before the main treatment of an aromatase inhibitor is given. It is agreed that more clinical trials are needed to confirm this issue.  Additionally, CDK 4/6 inhibition has shown to improve the efficacy of endocrine treatment.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Walter Heiligenberg": "Walter F. Heiligenberg (January 31, 1938 \u2013 September 8, 1994) is best known for his contribution to neuroethology through his work on one of the best neurologically understood behavioral patterns in vertebrate, Eigenmannia (Zupanc and Bullock 2006).  This weakly electric fish and the neural basis for its jamming avoidance response behavioral process was the main focus of his research, and is fully explored in his 1991 book, \"Neural Nets in Electric Fish.\"  As an international scientist, he worked alongside other neuroethologists and researchers to further explain animal behavior in a comprehensive manner and \"through the application of a strict analytical and quantitative method\" (Zupanc 2004).  The advancements within neuroethology today are still largely due to his influences, as his life was dedicated to researching that which could be applicable to \"all complex nervous systems\" and he \"[investigated] the general principles of nature\" (Autrum 1994).\n\n\n== Life and death ==\nHeiligenberg was born in Berlin, Germany, but moved to M\u00fcnster soon afterwards (Autrum 1994).  He then spent part of his early adulthood in Munich and Seewiesen before ultimately moving to San Diego, California, in 1972. Heiligenberg was killed in the crash of USAir Flight 427 on September 8, 1994, while on his way to deliver a lecture at the University of Pittsburgh (Leaders in Their Fields 1994).\n\n\n== Scientific background and work ==\nHeiligenberg's interest in ethology started at a young age, when he met Konrad Lorenz, one of the founders of modern ethology and head of a Max Planck research group, in 1953 (Zupance and Bullock 2006).  Through Lorenz's influence, his interest in fish and animal behavior thrived even before entering college (Autrum 1994).\nHe initially entered the University of M\u00fcnster in 1958, but transferred to the University of Munich after Lorenz and fellow neuroethologist Erich von Holst established the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in a city approximately 20 miles from Munich, in Seewiesen (Bullock et al. 1995).  Between these two colleges, his studies were spread between botany, zoology, physics, and mathematics, whose influence is clearly seen in his quantitative approaches in later research towards the neural bases of animal behavior (Zupanc and Bullock 2006).  It was here that his ethological foundation was laid, as he \"performed a quantitative analysis of the effect of motivational factors on the occurrence of various social behavioral patterns\" through his doctoral thesis, \"On causation of Behavioral Patterns in Chiclid Fish,\" which was completed in 1963 under Lorenz and Hansjochem Autrum, a sensory physiologist (Carr 1994; Zupanc and Bullock 2006).\n\n\n=== Academic career ===\nHis research continued to focus on the motivational behaviors of chiclid fish and crickets in Seewiesen (Heiligenberg 1965; Heiligenberg 1969), successfully conducting a quantitative demonstration of the \"law of heterogeneous summation,\" whose model predicted that \"different features of a stimulation in a [led] to an independent behavioral stimulation in the receiver\" (Zupanc and Bullock 2006).  Much of his work eventually led to the testing and production of evidence contrary to Lorenz's theory of the psychohydraulic model of motivation (specifically aggression) using male Chiclidae (Zupanc and Bullock 2006).  Such was his willingness to venture into new neuroethological territories despite the established research at the time.\nHis status as neuroethologist became further established when he moved to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), in 1972 as a post-doctoral investigator in Theodore Holmes Bullock's laboratory (Carr 1994).  His appointment to faculty in 1973, then to the position of full professor of behavioral physiology in 1977 followed his decision to decline the position of Director at the Max Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Seewiesen (Autrum 1994).\nHis work at UCSD led him to publish widely about the neural bases of the jamming avoidance response, the first vertebrate example of an entire behavioral pattern that could be explained from sensory input to motor output (Carr 1994).  The built-in electric organ of Eigennmania that gave millivolt discharges was found to be adaptive for location of external objects and for communication (electrolocation and electrocommunication, respectively) (Bullock et al. 1995).  Heiligenberg also continued study on the potentially more complex social behaviors, including courtship and aggressive encounters.  The decades' worth of work was expressed through the book, \"Neural Nets in Electric Fish,\" in which he explains observed phenomena of the jamming avoidance response, the nature of the electrical stimulus, the neural networks triggering them, and even explains it with respect to other sensory and species' systems (Heiligenberg 1991).  His inclination to successfully use computational methods and modeling made him a pioneer in the neuroethology community.\n\n\n=== Heiligenberg lab ===\nDuring Heiligenberg's time at Scripps, he directed his fellow researchers and graduate students toward exploring behavioral phenomena through neuroethological methods and interests.  His openness with his graduate students was notable, as he encouraged them not only to use and learn new techniques and other interests in different fields, but was also willing to allow them independently started projects and papers published without being named as a co-author (Zupanc and Bullock 2006).\nMore importantly, his personal work employed the useful aspects of both neurophysiology and ethology, whose approaches addressed the single-unit interactions and more complicated patterned processes, respectively (Heiligenberg1977).  In his own words, his methodology was based on the belief that it would be \"most promising if the behavior investigated is sufficiently simple to readily allow neurophysiological interpretations.  Particularly suitable are those patterns of behavior which still function while under the restricted condition of neurophysiological experiments, since stimulus input and behavioral output can immediately be related to neuronal events\" (Heiligenberg 1977).\n\n\n=== Publications ===\nA list of the journal articles and abstracts he helped to author at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography from 1960 to 1994, can be accessed through http://www.cnl.salk.edu/~kt/heiligref.html.  Furthermore, there is a complete list of Heiligenberg lab publications up to 2000 in Zupanc and Bullock's 2006 article titled \"Walter Heiligenberg: the jamming avoidance response and beyond?\" (Zupanc and Bullock 2006).  The Heiligenberg Lab at Scripps has a website at http://www.cnl.salk.edu/%7Ekt/Heiligenberg_Lab.html (Moortgat).\n\n\n== Honors ==\nThroughout Heiligenberg's lifetime, his dedication and groundbreaking research made him a leader in the neuroethology community.  At the time of his death, he had already received the Javits Award from the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, the Merit Award from the National Institute of Mental Health, and was a member of the Bavarian Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and also of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina (Zupanc and Bullock 2006). Heiligenberg also received the David Sparks Prize for systems neurophysiology and served as senior editor of the Journal of Comparative Physiology (Leaders in Their Fields 1994), an added honor to being an editor for the journal since 1981 (Autrum 1994). A student travel award of the International Society of Neuroethology is named in his honor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNeuroethology\nKonrad Lorenz\nErich von Holst\nTheodore Holmes Bullock\nCichlid\nElectric fish\nMax Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology\nScripps Institution of Oceanography\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Leaders in Their Fields, From Science to Business, Who Died in USAir Crash; Walter Heiligenberg, Scientist, 56\".

    "Toroidal polyhedron": "In geometry, a toroidal polyhedron is a polyhedron which is also a toroid (a g-holed torus), having a topological genus of 1 or greater. Notable examples include the Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r and Szilassi polyhedra.\n\n\n== Variations in definition ==\nToroidal polyhedra are defined as collections of polygons that meet at their edges and vertices, forming a manifold as they do. That is, each edge should be shared by exactly two polygons, and the link of each vertex should be a single cycle that alternates between the edges and polygons that meet at that vertex. For toroidal polyhedra, this manifold is an orientable surface. Some authors restrict the phrase \"toroidal polyhedra\" to mean more specifically polyhedra topologically equivalent to the (genus 1) torus.In this area, it is important to distinguish embedded toroidal polyhedra, whose faces are flat polygons in three-dimensional Euclidean space that do not cross themselves or each other, from abstract polyhedra, topological surfaces without any specified geometric realization. Intermediate between these two extremes are polyhedra formed by geometric polygons or star polygons in Euclidean space that are allowed to cross each other.\nIn all of these cases the toroidal nature of a polyhedron can be verified by its orientability and by its Euler characteristic being non-positive. The Euler characteristic generalizes to V \u2212 E + F = 2 \u2212 2N, where N is the number of holes.\n\n\n== Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r and Szilassi polyhedra ==\nTwo of the simplest possible embedded toroidal polyhedra are the Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r and Szilassi polyhedra.\nThe Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r polyhedron is a seven-vertex toroidal polyhedron with 21 edges and 14 triangular faces. It and the tetrahedron are the only known polyhedra in which every possible line segment connecting two vertices forms an edge of the polyhedron. Its dual, the Szilassi polyhedron, has seven hexagonal faces that are all adjacent to each other, hence providing the existence half of the theorem that the maximum number of colors needed for a map on a (genus one) torus is seven.The Cs\u00e1sz\u00e1r polyhedron has the fewest possible vertices of any embedded toroidal polyhedron, and the Szilassi polyhedron has the fewest possible faces of any embedded toroidal polyhedron.\n\n\n== Stewart toroids ==\nA special category of toroidal polyhedra are constructed exclusively by regular polygon faces, without crossings, and with a further restriction that adjacent faces may not lie in the same plane as each other. These are called Stewart toroids, named after Bonnie Stewart, who studied them intensively. They are analogous to the Johnson solids in the case of convex polyhedra; however, unlike the Johnson solids, there are infinitely many Stewart toroids. They include also toroidal deltahedra, polyhedra whose faces are all equilateral triangles.\nA restricted class of Stewart toroids, also defined by Stewart, are the quasi-convex toroidal polyhedra. These are Stewart toroids that include all of the edges of their convex hulls. For such a polyhedron, each face of the convex hull either lies on the surface of the toroid, or is a polygon all of whose edges lie on the surface of the toroid.\n\n\n== Self-crossing polyhedra ==\nA polyhedron that is formed by a system of crossing polygons corresponds to an abstract topological manifold formed by its polygons and their system of shared edges and vertices, and the genus of the polyhedron may be determined from this abstract manifold.\nExamples include the genus-1 octahemioctahedron, the genus-3 small cubicuboctahedron, and the genus-4 great dodecahedron.\n\n\n=== Crown polyhedra ===\n\nA crown polyhedron or stephanoid is a toroidal polyhedron which is also noble, being both isogonal (equal vertices) and isohedral (equal faces). Crown polyhedra are self-intersecting and topologically self-dual.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProjective polyhedron\nSkew apeirohedron (infinite skew polyhedron)\nSpherical polyhedron\nToroidal graph\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWeisstein, Eric W. \"Toroidal polyhedron\".

    "Nafsu": "Budak Nafsu (literally Slave to Lust, also known as Fatima) is a 1983 Indonesian film directed by Sjumandjaja and adapted from the 1981 novel Fatima by Titie Said. Starring Jenny Rachman and El Manik, it follows a mother who is forced to serve as a comfort woman for Japanese men stationed in British Malaya in an effort to save her daughter. The film was a commercial success, although critics have emphasised its sexual aspects.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFatima (Jenny Rachman) offers herself to be brought away by Japanese occupation forces to save her of her daughter, thus resigning herself to the fate of a comfort woman. She is one of hundreds of women sent from the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) to Japanese-occupied British Malaya and forced to work in a brothel. There she meets Takashi (El Manik), a kindly Japanese commander who falls in love with her. Fatima moves in with him, which protects her from the other men.\nMeanwhile, Fatima works with the local rebels and helps them capture the military base. The prisoners are freed. Takashi, meanwhile, discovers Fatima's betrayal and releases her before committing suicide. Although she is able to escape the base, Fatima is not allowed to join the rebels, having caught syphilis while at the brothel. As she makes her way back to the Indies, which has since proclaimed its independence, Fatima's ship is captured by Dutch soldiers from the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA).\nFatima is forced to work in a NICA brothel for the remainder of the Indonesian National Revolution, although she remains combative. After the revolution, Fatima is released into poverty and over the years finds that even Indonesians misuse her. She falls ill and is brought to a hospital, where she is treated by the daughter she had left years earlier, now a doctor. The aged Fatima soon leaves the hospital and wanders about, looking at the neon signs advertising Japanese products.\n\n\n== Production ==\nBudak Nafsu was directed by Sjumandjaja. He had been raised in Batavia (modern day Jakarta) during the Japanese occupation, and when the Japanese were expanding the Kemayoran Airport, he witnessed several forced labourers being beaten to death. He adapted Budak Nafsu from the novel Fatima (1981) by Titie Said; he had initially planned on keeping the original title, and the film has also been released as Fatima.The film starred Jenny Rachman in the leading female role of Fatima and El Manik as Takadeshi. More minor roles were taken by Sofia WD, Roy Marten, and Maruli Sitompul. Many of these actors had previous experience with the director. Sjumandjaja also had a cameo. According to El Manik, on one occasion the actor expressed concern that a Japanese commander would be unable to speak Indonesian fluently, as Sjumandjaja's screenplay called for, and that there should be Japanese-language dialogue. Sjumandjaja told him to write the dialogue himself if he wanted.The crew included Norman Benny as editor, Soetomo Gandasubrata as cinematographer, and Djufri Tanissan as artistic director; music was provided by Idris Sardi. Budak Nafsu was the first film produced by Raam Lalchand Pridhani (credited as Ram Soraya) and his Soraya Intercine Film.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nIn his 1991 typology of Indonesian cinema, the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider placed Budak Nafsu in a \"Japanese period\" genre, characterised by violence in excess of works showing the colonial period and the use of female nudity \"only as part of the violence, never as a consequence of love\". He also outlined a standard plot for these works, one reflected in Budak Nafsu. Other examples of the genre include Kadarwati, Kamp Tawanan Wanita (both 1983), and Lebak Membara (1982).\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nBudak Nafsu was released in 1983 and was a commercial success. Heider described Budak Nafsu as \"little more than a sex exploitation vehicle\", and several other critical reviews have emphasised the vulgarity of the film.A 35 mm copy of Budak Nafsu is available at Sinematek Indonesia.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nBudak Nafsu was nominated for nine Citra Awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning four.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Works cited ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFatima at IMDb",

    "Smoking in Iran": "Smoking in Iran has been banned in all public places since 2007. This includes all state bodies, hotels. A smoking ban for all car drivers nationwide was implemented in March 2006, and although offenders can face fines, the ban has been widely ignored. The sale of tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 is prohibited and is punishable by the confiscation of the vendor's tobacco products and a fine.\nAbout 20% of the adult male and 4.5% of the adult female population smoke tobacco (12 million smokers according to some estimates). 60,000 Iranians die directly or indirectly due to smoking every year (2008). Smoking is responsible for 25% of deaths in the country. Approx. 54-60 billion cigarettes are believed to be consumed annually in Iran.Around 2.7 billion cigarettes are smuggled into Iran annually, according to officials from the state-owned Iranian Tobacco Company (ITC), on top of another 26.7 billion which are imported legally (2008). Imports of cigarettes, tobacco, cigars, cigarette paper, cigarette tips are subject to government monopoly. Iranians spend more than $1.8 billion a year on tobacco.According to a 2010 law, smokers will not be appointed to senior government jobs.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIranian Tobacco Company\nHealth in Iran\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",
    "TAROM Flight 371": "TAROM Flight 371 was a scheduled international passenger flight, with an Airbus A310  from Otopeni International Airport in Romania's capital Bucharest to Brussels Airport in Brussels, Belgium. The flight was operated by TAROM, the flag carrier of Romania. On 31 March 1995, the Airbus A310-324, registered as YR-LCC, entered a nose-down dive after takeoff and crashed near Balote\u0219ti in Romania. All 60 people aboard were killed in the crash.Investigation of the crash revealed that the faulty auto-throttle reduced the left engine to idle during climb. While this was happening, the Captain became incapacitated, leaving the First Officer overwhelmed and unable to respond properly to the failure. The crash was the deadliest plane crash in Romania's history. It was also the deadliest plane crash in TAROM's operational history.\n\n\n== Aircraft ==\n\nThe aircraft involved in the crash was an Airbus A310-324 registered as YR-LCC and named Muntenia after one of Romania's historical regions. The Manufacturer's Serial Number (MSN) was 450, and the aircraft had its first flight in 1987. It was delivered to Pan American World Airways in August the same year registered as N814PA and named Clipper Liberty Bell. Following Pan Am's bankruptcy in 1991, the aircraft was transferred to Delta Air Lines with the same registration. TAROM purchased the aircraft and took delivery of it in April 1994 where it was re-registered as YR-LCC. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney PW4152 turbofan engines and had logged in 31,092 flight hours and 6,216 takeoff and landing cycles. Its airworthiness certificate was issued on 13 April 1994.\n\n\n== Passengers and crew ==\nThe aircraft was carrying 49 passengers and 11 crew members. 32 of the passengers were from Belgium, 9 from Romania, three from the United States, two from Spain, one from France, one from Thailand, and one from the Netherlands.\nThe Captain of the flight was 48-year-old Liviu B\u0103t\u0103noiu. He had a total of 14,312 flying hours with 1,735 on the Airbus A310. He graduated from the Aurel Vlaicu Military Aviation School in 1969. Before the flight to Brussels, he was assigned for a Bucharest \u2013 Tel Aviv flight. The last training on the type was on 12 November 1994 in a Swissair facility in Zurich, Switzerland.The First Officer was 51-year-old Ionel Stoi. He had a total of 8,988 flying hours with 650 on the Airbus A310. He graduated from the Aurel Vlaicu Military Aviation School in 1968. Before the flight to Brussels, he was assigned for a Chicago \u2013 Shannon flight. The last simulator training on the type was on 21 September 1994, carried out at a Swissair facility in Zurich, Switzerland.\n\n\n== Flight ==\nTAROM Flight 371 took off at 09:06:44 local time (06:06:44 UTC) from runway 08R, with First Officer Stoi as the pilot flying. The crew knew about a pre-existing anomaly with the thrust levers, with Captain B\u0103t\u0103noiu stating that he would guard the throttles during the climb. Stoi then asked B\u0103t\u0103noiu to retract the flaps and slats. B\u0103t\u0103noiu retracted the flaps, but failed to retract the slats. Noticing this, Stoi asked his captain what was wrong. B\u0103t\u0103noiu told First Officer Stoi he felt sick, then fell silent, apparently having lost consciousness. To make matters worse, the plane's left engine moved itself back into idle, resulting in asymmetric thrust as the right engine remained at climb power. Worse still, the speed of the aircraft began to decrease and the aircraft was banking sharply to the left. Preoccupied with trying to wake B\u0103t\u0103noiu, Stoi did not notice the rapidly increasing left roll. Cloud cover prevented him from visually noticing the roll.\nAt 09:08:18 local time, the engine thrust asymmetry reached its maximum value of 0.42 and the aircraft was now banking severely to the left at an angle of 45.09 degrees. The flight data recorder recorded an attempt to engage the autopilot. Then, a continuous thrust reduction on engine no. 2 was recorded. Stoi then disengaged the autopilot and the aircraft began to lose altitude rapidly. Flight 371 began to dive towards the ground. The aircraft rolled as its airspeed continued to increase. Stoi then cried out \"That one has failed!\" At this point, the aircraft was now nose diving with a pitch angle of -61.5 degrees. The aircraft violently crashed into the ground at 09:08:34 near Balotesti with a speed of 324 knots (600 km/h; 373 mph), destroying the aircraft completely on impact.Bucharest control tower then frantically tried to contact Flight 371, but to no avail. The tower asked another aircraft flying in the vicinity to contact Flight 371, while requesting that the TAROM dispatcher contact Flight 371 as well. After confirming that Flight 371 had lost all contact, Bucharest control tower issued a \"distress phase\" on the flight. Search and rescue teams were assembled by authorities and later found the crash site. The aircraft was pulverized on impact, leaving a 6-meter (20 ft) deep crater on the field. All 60 people aboard were killed instantly.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\n\n\n=== Technical investigation ===\nInvestigators discovered that there was a problem with the automatic throttle system (ATS), which controls the throttle of aircraft's engines. During their examination on the aircraft's logbook, they discovered that during the aircraft climb after takeoff, engine no. 1 had a tendency to go back to idle when switching from take-off power to climb power. The reason was unknown. After maintenance action taken by ground crew, the malfunction did not occur again until 16 March 1995. However, the ground crew warned about the possible recurrence of the malfunction. From the aircraft history record obtained from the FAA, a similar malfunction had been reported during its operation with Delta Air Lines. Delta performed the same actions that TAROM did.\nAirbus was aware of the automatic throttle system (ATS) malfunction. This defect could cause either the jamming of both throttles and ATS disconnection, or one throttle moving to idle while the other remained above climb power, without ATS disconnection. Investigators stated that the most probable cause of this malfunction was due to the excessive friction in the kinematic linkages between the throttle and the ATS coupling units. At the time of the accident, the Flight Crew Operating Manual (FCOM) issued by Airbus did not include the procedures to cope with this anomaly. However, the FCOM issued by TAROM and Swissair did include these procedures. The cockpit voice recorder also indicated that it appeared that Captain B\u0103t\u0103noiu had a health problem.\n\n\n=== Criminal investigation ===\nIn March 1995, a criminal investigation was started by the Prosecutor's Office attached to Bucharest Tribunal with the objective of establishing the circumstances of the air crash.\nIn 1997, the case was transferred from Prosecutor's Office attached to Bucharest Tribunal to Prosecutor's Office attached to Bucharest Court of Appeal for the reason of lack of legal competence. Since then, the case remains unsolved and in 2008, at the request of Prosecutor General Laura Codru\u021ba K\u00f6vesi, it has been revealed that the case files went missing completely.\n\n\n== Memorials ==\nA monument dedicated to the memory of the ones who perished in the accident is located in the vicinity of the crash site.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 2019, the accident was featured in the 6th episode of the 19th season of Mayday and Air Crash Investigation. The episode is titled \"Fatal Climb\" and premiered on 24 January 2019.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of accidents and incidents involving commercial aircraft\nManx2 Flight 7100, an accident where pilots mismanaged asymmetrical thrust on a Fairchild Metroliner, leading to a roll.\nTAM Transportes A\u00e9reos Regionais Flight 402, another incident involving thrust reverser on take off few years later\nAeroflot Flight 821, where pilots improperly managed asymmetrical thrust on a 737.\nLauda Air Flight 004, a 767 that crashed after the #1 engine thrust reverser deployed in the early climb-out phase of the flight at 24,000 ft, leading to a loss of control.\nS7 Airlines Flight 778, another Airbus A310 accident that experienced asymmetrical thrust, albeit during landing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo information and simulation of the crash on YouTube\nVideo of the crash site from Associated Press Archive\nPlanecrashinfo description\nRomanian (YR) air incidents at baaa-acro.com (Archive)\nPhoto of YR-LCC on airliners.net\nFINAL REPORT on the Accident of the Airbus A310-324, YR-LCC",

    "Pure Jerry: Keystone Berkeley, September 1, 1974": "Pure Jerry: Keystone Berkeley, September 1, 1974 is a three-CD live album by the Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders Band.  It contains the complete concert performed at the Keystone in Berkeley, California, on September 1, 1974.  The fourth in the Pure Jerry series of archival concert albums, it was released on December 28, 2004.Pure Jerry: Keystone Berkeley features Jerry Garcia on guitar and vocals, Merl Saunders on keyboards and vocals, Martin Fierro on saxophone and flute, John Kahn on bass, and Paul Humphrey on drums.  At this show, a trumpet player \nwhose identity is no longer known sat in on some of the songs.Some earlier sources referred to this band as Legion of Mary.  However, later research showed that the name Legion of Mary was only used from December 1974 to July 1975, after Ron Tutt replaced Paul Humphrey as the band's drummer.  A recording by that band is Legion of Mary: The Jerry Garcia Collection, Vol. 1. Released in August 2005, it contains selections from various concerts, recorded from December 1974 to July 1975, on two CDs.  A second LOM album is Garcia Live Volume Three, released in October 2013 and recorded at two concerts in December 1974.\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nOn Allmusic, Lindsay Planer wrote, \"Within this context, Garcia's predilection and underrated jazz leanings are given plenty of room for some stretched-out exploratory excursions.... For the inclined, 2004's Pure Jerry: Keystone Berkeley, September 1, 1974 is a no-brainer, while the faithful might liken it unto aural manna for the masses. Curious parties won't leave disappointed, either.\"In The Music Box, John Metzger wrote, \"Granted, the set lists employed by any of the Garcia-Saunders projects didn't vary tremendously from one show to the next, and each was peppered with an organic blend of Bob Dylan-penned, Motown-germinated, jazz, blues, funk, reggae, and rock selections.... Not surprisingly, the end result of such improvisational mayhem could be a hit-and-miss affair, but for whatever reason, September 1, 1974 yielded a truly awesome, mind-blowing experience, one that rivaled the Grateful Dead's own astonishing sojourns.... In essence, the fourth chapter in the Pure Jerry series amounts to being a whirlwind tour de force that far and away surpasses not only the entirety of Jerry Garcia's solo canon, but also many of the Grateful Dead's own releases.\"On Jambands.com, Benjy Eisen said, \"Like most of his collaborations with the encyclopedic Merl Saunders, this particular Garcia project draws from the music that gave birth to rock n' roll, and really becomes a musical revue in that sense. With the Grateful Dead, Garcia forged new musical boundaries. With this band, he stops to consider heritage. And at a time when rock 'n' roll was young to begin with.... Interestingly, Garcia does not dominate all the jams here. The baton gets passed around frequently from guitar to horns to keyboards, and the game of musical chairs is executed skillfully, with leads chasing leads, and one instrument following the other. Hand-offs are exchanged generously and gracefully, with a true sense of musical conversation. The thrill of this release is in listening to the interplay, because that's where all the action is.\"In Glide magazine, Susan J. Weiand wrote, \"Martin Fierro's tasteful contributions on sax and flute are clear and true, and combined with the playing of the unnamed trumpet player add so much texture to the songs. Jerry's voice sounds fresh and youthful, his playing inspired and energetic, while Merl really delivers the soul with his organ and singing, and Kahn's bass and Humphrey's drums are steady. It is evident that Jerry loved playing in his side projects as much as he loved to play with the Grateful Dead. The mood is so relaxed and one can almost hear the glasses clinking at the bar, but the music delivers the Pure Jerry fix that Deadheads and other fans can really appreciate.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDisc 1\n\n\"Neighbor, Neighbor\" (Alton Joseph Valier) \u2013 8:46\n\"Keepers\" (Merl Saunders, John Kahn) \u2013 11:15\n\"Sitting in Limbo\" (Jimmy Cliff, Guillermo Bright) \u2013 12:50\n\"Favela\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim) \u2013 13:40\n\"Tough Mama\" (Bob Dylan) \u2013 7:14\n\"La La\" (Martin Fierro) \u2013 22:43Disc 2\n\n\"Someday Baby\" (Lightnin' Hopkins) \u2013 9:52\n\"Think\" (Jimmy McCracklin, Deadric Malone) \u2013 7:09\n\"Roadrunner\"  (Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Eddie Holland) \u2013 10:15\n\"The Harder They Come\" (Cliff) \u2013 13:21\n\"I Second That Emotion\" (Smokey Robinson, Al Cleveland) \u2013 14:35\n\"Going, Going, Gone\" (Dylan) \u2013 14:25Disc 3\n\n\"Soul Roach\" (Saunders, Ray Shanklin) \u2013 10:32\n\"Mystery Train\" (Sam Phillips, Junior Parker) \u2013 12:51\n\"Wondering Why\" (Saunders, Pam Carrier) \u2013 15:53\n\"People Make the World Go Round\" (Thom Bell, Linda Epstein) \u2013 3:43\n\"Keystone Jam\" (Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders Band) \u2013 15:16\n\"It's Too Late\" (Chuck Willis) \u2013 8:55\n\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" \u2013 (Robbie Robertson) \u2013 6:26\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== Musicians ===\nJerry Garcia \u2013 guitar, vocals\nMerl Saunders \u2013 keyboards, vocals\nMartin Fierro \u2013 saxophone, flute, percussion\nJohn Kahn \u2013 bass\nPaul Humphrey \u2013 drums\nmystery artist \u2013 trumpet on some tracks\n\n\n=== Production ===\nExecutive producer: Christopher Sabec, Peter McQuaid\nRecording: Betty Cantor-Jackson\nResearch, tape compilation: David Lemieux\nEngineer: Tom Flye\nSecond engineer: Robert Gatley\nMastering: John Cuniberti\nAlbum coordination: Jeff Adams\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Alves railway station": "Alves  was a railway station located near Elgin, in the Scottish administrative area of Moray. The station was the junction where the line to Burghead and Hopeman diverged from the line from Aberdeen to Inverness.\n\n\n== History ==\nOpened by the Inverness and Aberdeen Junction Railway, then absorbed by the Highland Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. It was then closed by the British Railways Board in May 1965 as a result of the Beeching Axe.\nPassenger services on the Burghead & Hopeman branch line (opened in 1862) were withdrawn considerably earlier, by the LMS back in September 1931.  Goods traffic continued (in the form of grain to the whisky distillery at Roseisle and the maltings at Burghead) until 1992. The section as far the former was reopened in January 1998, but traffic ceased again shortly afterwards and the branch is now disused & overgrown. This line has now been disconnected from the main Aberdeen to Inverness line as part of upgrades to the track and signalling in 2018. \n\n\n== The site today ==\nTrains still pass the site on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line.

    "Fey Truscott-Sade": "Fey Truscott-Sade, also known as Fey or Feyde, is a fictional character who appeared in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip based on the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who. She was a companion of the Eighth Doctor.\n\n\n== Character history ==\nFey is a native of Earth in the early 20th century. She first appeared in the comic strip story Tooth and Claw, published in DWM #257-#260, written by Alan Barnes and drawn by Martin Geraghty and Robin Smith. In 1939, Fey was an undercover operative working for the British government, and had previously encountered the Doctor in an unpublished adventure involving psychic weasels in Russell Square. The Doctor had given her a Stattenheim Summoner \u2014 a device disguised as a tin whistle that could contact the TARDIS \u2014 and Fey called on the Doctor and his companion Izzy to help her investigate the sinister Varney.\nVarney had been taking many to his private island to wait out the coming war in safety; however the question was what exactly happened to Varney's guests. It was here Fey met Izzy Sinclair, another friend of the Doctor.\nThe events of Tooth and Claw proved costly for the Doctor. Although they ultimately defeated Varney, the Doctor had injected himself with a deadly bacillus and was dying. Fey somehow managed to pilot the TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where the Doctor's body was cured and his mind placed into the Matrix to heal. Izzy came along for the trip.\nWhile within the Matrix, an attempt was made on the Doctor's life by a secret Time Lord sect known as the Elysians. This was foiled by Shayde, a construct of the Matrix and an old ally of the Doctor's. The assassination attempt was part of a plot by Overseer Luther, an insane Time Lord who wanted to rewrite Gallifrey's history and set himself up as a god. The Doctor managed to thwart Luther by short-circuiting his watchtower (a gigantic TARDIS), but apparently at the cost of his eighth body. As Izzy and Fey watched, the Doctor regenerated into a new incarnation (The Final Chapter, DWM #262-#265).\nHowever, this was a ruse. The Doctor had realised that Fey was under external control when she had managed to pilot the TARDIS even though the TARDIS manual was in Gallifreyan script, which she did not understand. Just before the Doctor prepared to sacrifice himself, Shayde offered to take his place and fake a regeneration. This way, the group that was controlling Fey \u2014 the Threshold, a mercenary organisation that the Doctor had tangled with before \u2014 would seize the opportunity to bring a newly regenerated and thus weaker Doctor to them. Both disguised with personal chameleon circuits, Shayde would hold their attention while the Doctor sabotaged the Threshold's operations.\nIn a Wild West town on an alien moon run by the Threshold, the Doctor's plans came to fruition. The Threshold removed an implant from Fey, gloating that she had been an unwitting spy for them ever since they kidnapped her in 1937 and placed the device in her head. Preparing for the final confrontation, Shayde and the Doctor revealed themselves to the Threshold. However, Shayde had to contend with the Pariah, an immensely powerful being who was a prototype version of himself. Shayde was unable to defeat the Pariah on his own, and she crushed his skull.\nComforting the dying Shayde, Fey merged with the Gallifreyan construct and together they were able to kill the Pariah and eliminate the Threshold. The shared being, dubbed \"Feyde\" by the Doctor, although both of them retained their own consciousness, decided to leave and deal with what had just happened to them (Wormwood, DWM #266-#271).\nFey returned to 1939, where she continued to work for the British government. Fey spent two years fighting the Nazis with Shayde, frustrated that Shayde would not allow her to use their powers to kill Adolf Hitler, as this would change history. In 1941, she received a sub-ether summons from the Doctor \u2014 Izzy had been kidnapped, and the Doctor needed Shayde's abilities to track her whereabouts. Together, they succeeded in recovering Izzy, and \"Feyde\" returned to World War II after sharing a farewell kiss with Izzy (Oblivion, DWM #323-#328).\nAs a merged entity, Fey is able to share Shayde's powers, including the ability to travel through time and space unaided, phase through solid objects and fire self-generated \"psychic bullets\". Fey's penchant for dressing in masculine clothing and her relationship with Izzy implied that she was a lesbian, but her actual orientation was never made explicit, however given certain pieces of dialogue with the Doctor, there is evidence that she is actually bisexual. Fey and Shayde have also developed a love/hate relationship over the course of their unison, Fey telling Shayde things of her own life, but often resents his unswerving loyalty to Rassilon and preserving the web of time. Her initial appearance in Tooth and Claw was inspired by Katharine Hepburn.\n\n\n== External links ==\nFey Truscott-Sade on Tardis Data Core,  an external wiki",

    "High Park North": "High Park North, or often simply High Park, after the park, is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bounded on the south by Bloor Street, on the west by Runnymede Road, on the north by Annette Street, Quebec Avenue and Humberside Avenue, and on the east by the GO Transit Weston Subdivision rail tracks (formerly owned by Canadian National Railway). It is located in the Parkdale\u2014High Park provincial and federal electoral districts. The area east of Keele Street is also known informally as the \"West Bend\" neighbourhood.\n\n\n== Character ==\n\nHigh Park North is mainly residential, containing many semi-detached homes built in the early 20th century. North of High Park, the neighbourhood has several high-rise apartment buildings, built after the construction of the Bloor-Danforth subway.\nBloor Street is the main east-west thoroughfare. It is a four-lane road and is mostly commercial with storefront-type businesses that have residential second and third storeys. North-south roads include Keele Street and Dundas Street. Both are primarily residential within the neighbourhood.\nThe oldest residential houses in High Park North were built in the late 1800s and early 1900s and are mostly Victorian, Edwardian and Tudor-style. The houses are typically two- and three-storey detached brick homes. Many homes have leaded and stained glass windows, wood trim, French doors, hardwood doors, and fireplaces.Just north of the park is a district of high-rise apartment buildings, dating from the 1960s and 1970s. These are primarily located on Gothic, High Park, and Quebec Avenues.\n\n\n== History ==\nHIgh Park North exists within the traditional territories of the Missisauga Anishinaabeg. The area however has also been home to Huron-Wendat and Haudenosaunee nations throughout history. High Park North exists on part of an old trading trail that led down toward the lake. This trail is the namesake for Indian Road, Indian Road Crescent, and Indian Grove.\nHigh Park North falls entirely within the boundaries of the town of Toronto Junction, which was purchased from the Keele estate in 1882 by Daniel Clendenan who subdivided the farm and racetrack for a residential district (now called High Park North) to serve the Junction commercial district.  As Bloor Street was still an uneven and a mostly undeveloped street, early housing in the area was concentrated to the north and east, where it was easier to access the stores and industry along Dundas Street.  High Park Avenue in particular was the site of many early homes of the Junction wealthy, as was modern Evelyn Crescent; many of these houses are still standing.  High Park North emerged as a neighbourhood once Bloor Street was widened and evened out following World War I, when most of the residential homes which still exist today were built.\n\n\n=== 20th Century ===\nIn 1915, Bloor Street was the site of a major public works at the north-west corner of High Park. The street, west of High Park Avenue, was crossed by creeks that emptied into Grenadier Pond. The creek banks were steep, making the roadway treacherous and difficult for traffic. A rail trestle was built to cross the gap at a level of 60 feet. The rails were used for rail cars to dump soil around the trestle. The trestle was completely buried and the present Bloor Street roadway built on top. Existing north-south roadways connecting to Bloor Street were raised to meet the new level of Bloor Street and this facilitated the development of the neighbourhood. The first building in Canada designed by a Canadian trained female architect was constructed in the neighbourhood during this period. This landmark building by Jean Hall is a 1925 fourplex located at 63 Jerome Street.\n\nIn the 1960s, the area directly north of High Park was the site of 'block-busting' development. After the construction of the Bloor-Danforth subway line in the 1960s, the nearby residences on High Park Avenue, Quebec Avenue and Gothic Avenue were bought up by developers, razed and large apartment buildings were built. The area from north of the subway line to Glenlake Avenue is now almost entirely high-rise towers. At the time, the City government was very much pro-development, and there were no local ratepayer/community associations as is seen today. Local City alderman Ben Grys, along with his wife, owned properties on Gothic Avenue and voted to approve the apartment project on the site before his family's land holdings were revealed by John Sewell through a search of local property tax rolls. Under vague conflict-of-interest guidelines, Grys continued as alderman until he was defeated in the following municipal election. Grys sued Sewell over Sewell's attempt to remove him but eventually withdrew his case when it became clear that Sewell would get access to further information about his business dealings. By the 1970s, local residents formed associations in harmony with new reform Council members, partly to fight the block-busting north of High Park.\n\n\n=== 21st Century ===\nThe desirability of living close to High Park and the subway keeps developers operating in the neighbourhood, although not on the scale of the past. In the first decade of the 2000s, a condominium development was built on the site of a former gas station on the south side of Bloor Street, overlooking High Park on the landfill of the former bridge over Wendigo Creek.\nOne block east of High Park Avenue, between Pacific and Oakmount, a block of Edwardian-era homes was purchased for demolition. The area is the site of a condominium development overlooking High Park. A tenant of one of the homes remained while the other homes became vacant and boarded up until eviction in 2010, much like the block-busting of the 1960s and 1970s. This is the first block of older homes directly on Bloor Street, facing High Park, to be demolished for apartment building.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe High Park neighbourhood has a population of 22162.\n\n\n=== Generation Status ===\nBetween the years of 2006 and 2011, there were changes in the generation status of the population aged 15 years and older. In 2006, 62% of the total population were 1st generation, which is higher than that of 2011, which was 59%. The number of people who were 2nd or 3rd generation increased since 2006 in 2011. In 2006, 16% were 2nd generation, and 22% were 3rd generation. In 2011, 17% were 2nd generation and 24% were 3rd generation. The 2011 GNR was 32.6%.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is an English secular public school board that serves the City of Toronto.

Originally the parish was to be named after St. Charles. According to historical records, however, the first school\u2014a small wooden structure\u2014was named St.Mary's. In 1890 the school was replaced with a brick building and renamed St.Cecilia's. Legend has it that St. Cecilia, the patron saint of sacred music, was chosen as the new name because the Heintzman Piano factory stood in view, across the railway tracks, from the school. The present St. Cecilia's Church, at the corner of Annette Street and Pacific Avenue, was opened in 1909, replacing a smaller structure first occupied in 1895. Father Eugene Gallagher was the pastor.\n\nThe present St. Cecilia Catholic School at the corner of Annette Street and Evelyn Avenue opened in 1914 with additions in 1918, 1954 and 1964. The school's first teachers and administrators were the Loretto Nuns, who lived in the former Heintzman family residence at Annette and Laws Streets, providing another musical connection with St. Cecilia.\n\n\n=== Toronto Public Library ===\nThe Runnymede Branch of the Toronto Public Library, housed in a renovated heritage building built in 1930, is located within High Park North at Bloor Street West and Glendonwynne Road.

    "Witold Be\u0142za": "Witold Stanis\u0142aw Kazimierz Be\u0142za (8 May 1886 \u2013 24 February 1955) was a Polish librarian, writer, publicist and cultural activist. He was the director of the Provincial and Municipal Public Library of Bydgoszcz from 1920 to 1939 and from 1945 to 1952.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Youth and First World War ===\nWitold Be\u0142za was born on 8 May 1886, in Warsaw. His father, Stanis\u0142aw Be\u0142za (1849-1929) was a Silesian lawyer and journalist and his mother Jadwiga n\u00e9e Kobyla\u0144ska, the daughter of a Warsaw doctor. Stanis\u0142aw  and Jadwiga had also two daughters, Janina and Helenas. Witold, in his early years, was impressed by the strong patriotic feelings of his father and his travels, his social activities: he even attended a rally organized by Stanis\u0142aw in Opole while \naged 7.Witold attended a gymnasium in Warsaw. At that time, the social unrest in the Polish capital against russification in the education and the social life under Russian rule stirred strikes in schools, preventing Witold to finish his junior high school. He had to leave to join the prestigious Jesuit School in Chyr\u00f3w (today's Khyriv, Ukrain) where in 1905, he passed his end of secondary school examination. In 1910, he started to work in the library of the National Ossoli\u0144ski Institute in Lviv: he left the position only in 1920. Between 1911 and 1914, he studied at the Faculty of Humanities of Lviv University. During his stay in the Ukrainian capital, he was engaged in journalistic and literary works: among others, he was the editor of \"Poradnika Teatr\u00f3w i Ch\u00f3r\u00f3w W\u0142o\u015bcia\u0144skich\" and a collaborator of \"Pami\u0119tnik Literacki\" (Literary Diary).Be\u0142za was traveling in Switzerland when World War I broke out. He opted to stay in the country and took a job as a librarian in the Polish Museum in Rapperswil. In January 1917, he was able to move back to the Ossolineum of Lw\u00f3w. There, under the supervision of professor Wilhelm Bruchnalski, Witold wrote his thesis entitled \"Wernyhora in S\u0142owacki's poetry\", for which he obtained his Doctor of Philosophy from the University of Lviv. During the graduating ceremony, the poet Jan Kasprowicz himself handed out the Ph.D to Be\u0142za. Until 1920, he worked at the Ossolineum in Lviv, at the time led by Wojciech K\u0119trzy\u0144ski and Ludwik Bernacki.\n\n\n=== Life in Bydgoszcz ===\n\n\n==== Head of the Municipal Library ====\nIn August 1920, aged 34, Witold Be\u0142za settled in Bydgoszcz, as a winner of a contest for the library direction launched by the local authorities. He lived downtown at 6 20 Stycznia 1920 Street, apartment 3. On 1 September, he sat at the position of director of the Municipal and People's Library. There, he took care of the comprehensive Polonization of the institution. Within a few years, he transformed the German book collection into a valuable Polish one. He expanded the manuscript department and recovered from German hands the remains of the Bernardine Library.\nBe\u0142za received numerous donations and deposits for the library and educated many librarians. Among the donators there were writers,\nscientists, artists, among others: painters Franciszek Teodor Ejsmond and Jerzy Mieczys\u0142aw Rupniewski, Konstanty Laszczka, scholar Rudolf M\u0119kicki, Feliks Nowowiejski, Stanis\u0142aw \u0141empicki, Marian Turwid and Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski. The director of the library even donated manuscripts he owned from authors like J\u00f3zef Kallenbach, Aleksander Br\u00fcckner or from his father's or uncle's works. \nHe converted the institution into a significant research center. Noticeable donator includes Kazimierz Kierski, then president of the General Prosecutor's Office in Pozna\u0144, who handed over a collection of almost 2700 documents (privileges, diplomas, nomination letters, etc.) with 13 parchments and more than 500 letters and royal documents. Unfortunately, Kierski's collection was lost during WWII and German occupation. Another important contributor was Adam Grzyma\u0142a-Siedlecki, who donated a dozen of books from Vladimir Lenin's Poronin collection, from the period when the soviet leader-to-be used to stay in the Polish Tatra (1913-1914). In 1945, the City Council handed it over back to the Soviet Union as a gift from the Polish People's Republic. From the 75,000 volumes (almost exclusively in German) in 1920, Be\u0142za increased the collection of the library to more than 136 000 volumes\nin 1939, and up to 231 000 volumes in 1952.In addition to the library director position, Witold kept working on scientific and literary topics: he published studies in the field of library science, history of Polish literature and theater criticism. He was also the author of several works of fiction and translations of German and French books, from authors such as Franz Werfel, Bruno Traven or Henri-Robert.From 1935 to 1936, he started to collaborate regularly to the Polish Biographical Dictionary, preparing several biographies. Similarly, he wrote correspondence and columns for local and national press. Many of his literary work manuscripts were lost during the German occupation, notably a 600-page writing entitled \"Ksawera Deibel\" based on authentic letters from Adam Mickiewicz to Xawera (1818-1900), a Polish singer, Chopin's student and Mickiewicz's long-time lover. From 1934 to 1939, he fulfilled an additional duty as head of the Department of Education and Culture of the Municipal Board.\n\n\n==== Cultural activist ====\nAs an early lover of music and singing, Be\u0142za regularly attended premieres at the City Theater. He also, thanks to his position, often joined music events. He often played piano during social gatherings and was active in the chamber music section from the Bydgoszcz Music Society, created in 1922 by Ludwik Regamey. He was a member of the Society board and eventually became its vice president. In the 1920s, Witold performed a series of lectures related to French music and culture, which included Ludwik Regamey's musical performances.Be\u0142za was active in other socio-cultural organizations:\n\nthe Polish Intelligentsia Organization (from 1921), disseminating Polish literature and the History of Poland;\nthe Society of the Lovers of the City of Bydgoszcz (Polish: Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Miasta Bydgoszczy), which he co-created in 1923;\nthe Regional Museum in Bydgoszcz, as one of the initiators of the establishment;\nthe Artistic and Cultural Council in Bydgoszczz (Polish: Rada Artystyczno-Kulturalna w Bydgoszczy) (1934-1939).With his hectic activity, he significantly contributed to the growth of Bydgoszcz as a cultural center in Pomorskie Voivodeship and in the country. \nIn 1933, thanks to the efforts of Zygmunt Malewski, an employee of the Municipal Archives, Witold Be\u0142za launched the first issue of \"Przegl\u0105d Bydgoski\" (Bydgoszcz Review), a scientific journal devoted to the history of the city, to religious and secular art, and literature.\n\n\n==== World War II and final years ====\nWitold Be\u0142za spent the war time outside of Bydgoszcz. He first stayed a few months in Briukhovychi near Lviv as a teacher, then he moved to Lviv, where he was running and organizing the library at the Children's Clinic. In 1944, when a bomb destroyed the house they lived in, Be\u0142za and his family moved to Ci\u0119\u017ckowice near Tarn\u00f3w, staying there during the last months of the war. He returned to Bydgoszcz on 14 March 1945, and was once again entrusted with the management of the Municipal Library.\nIn the post-war years, he combined other posts:\n\nhead of the Municipal Department of Culture and Art (September 1945 - February 1949);\nliterary director of the Municipal Theater (1946 - 1947);\nlecturer at the Bydgoszcz Drama School (1947).After 1946, under his leadership, a network of Public Libraries was being developed within the city.\n\nOn 28 August 1945, the city authorities assigned Be\u0142za to organize the jubilee celebration of the 600th anniversary of Bydgoszcz. His other activities in this period include:\nthe set up of a Medical Library branch in the City library (December 1947), as a result of his experience in Lviv during the war;\nactive membership of multiple Literary Societies (A. Mickiewicz association, Association of Polish Librarians, Polish Writers' Union);\npublishing in several periodicals between 1945 and 1949 (\"Ilustrowany Kurier Polski\", \"Trybuna Pomorska\", \"Ziemia Pomorskie\", \"Tygodnik Warszawski\").The end of the 1940s marked the beginning of his parting from the new city authorities, for political reasons. Although Be\u0142za joined the United People's Party and participated in the ideological training, he was no more conveniently considered by the ruling organs. As a consequence, in April 1951, he had to leave his apartment at 7 Asnyka street, which was soon put at the disposal of the Provincial Public Security Office. As a result, he moved to live in a flat at 33 Gda\u0144ska street. \nHis fall was pushed down further as on 1 December 1952, he was removed from the position of Library director and deprived of the associated allowance. Finally, on 31 December of that year he was put to retirement. For some time, Witold worked in the Municipal Library as an assistant, but he eventually left for good the institution on 31 August 1953.State authorities prevented him to resume any further professional activity, like at the Jagiellonian Library in Krak\u00f3w or at the City Print House (\"Pa\u0144stwowe Zak\u0142ady Wydawnictw Szkolnych\" or PZWS). Witold Be\u0142za died on 24 February 1955 in Bydgoszcz. He was buried in Bydgoszcz Nowofarny Cemetery. After his death, not a single official obituary was released.\n\n\n=== Personal life and family ===\nOn 21 April 1917, Witold married Karolina Ludwika n\u00e9e Winiarz; Jan Kasprowicz was one of his witnesses. Karolina originated from a family of distinguished booksellers and printers of Lviv. They had a daughter, Halina (1919\u20131992), who married Jan Harasymowicz, a Polish professor of technical sciences from the Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko University of Technology in Krak\u00f3w, and a son Stanis\u0142aw Janusz (1921-1982), lawyer and court expert. Janusz' daughter, Anna Dzier\u017cykraj-Lipowicz, has been instrumental to keep the memory of her grandfather alive, collecting and sharing family mementoes and other details of his life.Witold's father Stanis\u0142aw was a lawyer, writer and an independence activist. He traveled across Europe, Asia and Africa. He published his impressions of his journeys in the form of small brochures which he gave to libraries, e.g. \"Holandia\" (1890), \"W kraju tysi\u0105ca jezior\" (In the country of a thousand lakes (1896), \"Obrazy i obrazki z Indii\" (Images and Pictures from India) (1912) or \"Echa Szwajcarii\" (The echoes of Switzerland) (1927). He often addressed topics related to Polish Silesia in his writings and social activities, especially at the time of the Upper Silesia plebiscite in 1921. Stanis\u0142aw was a member of the Pozna\u0144 Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences. He was at the initiative of the creation of the municipal library in Chorz\u00f3w, Silesia, in 1922.\n\nWitold's uncle, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Be\u0142za (1847\u20131913), was also a writer, journalist and administrative secretary of the National Ossoli\u0144ski Institute in Lviv. Like his brother Stanis\u0142aw, he was a social activist and a correspondent member of the Pozna\u0144 Society for the Advancement of Arts and Sciences.\nWitold's grandfather, J\u00f3zef Be\u0142za (1805-1888), was a Polish chemist, pioneer of the sugar industry in Poland.\n\n\n== Decorations ==\nGolden Cross of Merit\n\n\n== Commemorations ==\nWitold's son donated his father's diary to the University of Bydgoszcz.

She insisted without any evidence that the incident was due to nearby Wichita, Kansas being a \"sanctuary city\".She has also targeted the LGBTQ+ community. She once famously sponsored a bill that referenced same-sex marriage as \"parody marriage\" and offered support for conversion therapy and other anti-LGBTQ provisions.\n\nWhen called out on this, she claimed to not have read the bill that she was sponsoring.\nRepresentative Helmer attracted national attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when she requested that Kansas Governor (of the opposing party) produce information on the Governor's hairstyling.  \u201cI am respectfully requesting the name and Kansas license No. of the hairdresser who has touched, colored, cut, performed any service on or with Governor Laura Kelly\u2019s hair since March 12,\u201d Helmer said.

    "C1orf21": "Uncharacterized protein C1orf21, also known as Proliferation-Inducing Protein 13, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the C1orf21 gene. C1orf21 is an intracellular protein that flows between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the cell. It has been linked with cell growth and reproduction and there has been strong links with various types of cancers. There are no paralogs for this gene, however, many conserved orthologs have been found in all invertebrates. C1orf21 has low to moderate level of expression in most tissues in humans, however, it has the most expression in the skin, lung and prostate.\n\n\n== Gene ==\n\n\n=== Locus ===\nC1orf198 is a protein-encoding gene found on the reverse strand of chromosome 1 at the locus 1q25.3.\n\n\n=== Gene neighborhood ===\nC1orf21 is located on the long arm of chromosome 1. It is found at position 5q23.1.\n\nCytogenic band: 1q25.3\n\n\n=== Size ===\nChromosome one is one of the longest chromosomes, in which C1orf21 spans from 184,385,826 to 184,390,390 bases, resulting with mRNA transcript that is 10,278 nucleotides long with 4 exons. The protein is 121 amino acids long, containing a domain of unknown function known as DUF4612.\n\n\n=== Expression ===\nNCBI gene and RNA-Seq revealed that C1orf21 is expressed in all tissues at a low to moderate level, however, it is mostly expressed in the skin, brain and prostate.\n\n\n== Gene level regulation ==\n\n\n=== Promoter ===\nThere was over 7 promoters that were predicted, but the true promoter was 1111 base pairs long known as .\n\n\n=== Transcription factor binding sites ===\nMany transcription factor (TF) binding sites have been predicted through Genomatix. Some important binding cites include MYRE, MARs, and Bright.\nMYRE is a myelin regulatory factor. Myelin is produced in the central nervous system and plays a large role in axons. MARs is a special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 1, predominantly expressed in thymocytes, binds to matrix attachment regions. Bright helps with B cell regulator of IgH transcription.\n\n\n== Protein ==\n\n\n=== Subcellular location ===\nIt was predicted that the location of C1orf21 is in the nucleus with 62.2% certainty. The mitochondria was predicted at 17.4%: mitochondrial, while the cytoskeleton, and vascular system at 4.3%.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nC1orf21 protein is 121 amino acids long with a molecular weight of 18,7 kDa with an isoelectric point of 5.08. It is believed that the protein interacts with the nuclear membrane and contains an unknown domain known as DUF4612. For the secondary and tertiary structure it is predicted that there are many alpha helices in the structure, with the rest of the protein having a disordered structure.\n\n\n== Protein level regulation ==\nO-glycosylation sites: Serine 5, Threonine 11, Serine 66, Serine 68, and Serine 69.\nPalmitioyaltion site: Cysteine 3\nPhosphorylation: Serine 34, Serine 44, Serine 66, Serine 69, Serine 75, Serine 95, Serine 115, Serine 121 \nSumoylation site: Lysine 46 and Lysine 106 \nTyrosine sulfation site: Tyrosine 113\n\n\n== Interacting proteins ==\n\n\n== Homology ==\n\n\n=== Paralogs ===\n\nThere are no isoforms or paralogs of C1orf21 that are known.\n\n\n=== Orthologs ===\nC1orf21 is found in most classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates. The most distant ortholog of C1orf21 is Acropora digitifera, which diverged an estimated 824 million years ago. There is no traces of the C1orf21 gene in organisms that are traced beyond invertebrates, such as fungi, plants, protists, or single celled organisms.\n\n\n=== Homologous domains ===\nThe domain of unknown function 4612 (DUF4612) was highly conserved in most orthologs.\n\n\n== Function ==\nC1orf21 is most likely involved in the growth of cells, especially in the nucleus where replication of DNA occurs.\n\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nEven though there is not a lot known about C1orf21, there have been some links with diseases. In many studies it has been found that there are links with cancer. Since C1orf21 is associated with cell proliferation, in another study by Sooda et. al. there was an interest in the transcript map of the HPC1 locus, to help them identify the susceptibility genes involved in prostate cancer and jaw tumor.  It was seen that overall there are several studies where C1orf21 has been studied on role it plays in cancer for different body areas among many other genes. It was also found that there is a large correlation with affects on keratinocytes since C1orf21 plays a role in ZNF750 silencing.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHuman C1orf21 genome location and C1orf21 gene details page  in the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n\n== Further reading ==",

    "Royal Derwent Hospital": "The Royal Derwent Hospital, (originally New Norfolk Insane Asylum and later Lachlan Park) was built to house mentally ill and mentally handicapped persons in 1827, soon after the separation of Van Diemens Land from New South Wales. Its name was changed on 27 March 1968 to the Royal Derwent Hospital., also absorbing the nearby Millbrook Rise facility on 1 July 1968 to house patients. It was open for more than 170 years, finally closing in November 2000.\nWillow Court is a rich and complex heritage site with a diverse range of stories, reactions and opinions. These stem from the local community, the individuals hospitalised at Willow Court, their families and friends, the workers and professionals employed throughout its history\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Royal Derwent Hospital was originally an Invalid Barracks, for invalid convicts and those considered mentally ill who had been transported to Van Diemens Land. It was expanded in 1830 by Lt-Governor Arthur, and held more than 130 invalids and mentally ill. During the 1850s it was taken over by the Colonial Government, from then on numbers of the inmates expanded rapidly, as penal institutions started to close down across the colony and their invalids were sent up to the Hospital.The hospital was closed in late 2000, as smaller community-sited care institutes proceeded rapidly, and the hospital could no longer be funded by the Tasmanian State Government.Today parts of the hospital site are currently sitting derelict and has been the subject of a great deal of vandalism and was badly damaged by separate arson attacks in January 2008 and December 2010 Further pieces of the site, which have been sold to private ownership, have been reopened as a tourist drawcard with a motel, two cafes, various boutique stores and two antique stores.\nOn the 6th of September 2018, further arson attacks caused extensive damage to Ward G. The building is expected to be demolished.\n\n\n== Haunting ==\nWillow Court has become notorious for supposed hauntings and ghost sightings since it shut down according to paranormal enthusiasts, so much so that in February 2011 the Derwent Valley Council agreed to a paranormal investigation. The action was criticised by the former mayor, several councilors, advocacy groups supporting previous residents, ex staff and inhabitants of New Norfolk because there were still people living who had been incarcerated in the hospital or had relatives there and it was considered to demonize previous residents and staff. There is no evidence of such haunting claims that have been verified by science, but this is keenly spoken about by believers of the paranormal.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDr Bruce Maitland Carruthers OBE (1892\u20131951), a former Director-General of Health in Tasmania was the administrator of the Lachlan Park Hospital 1935\u20141936.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotographs of Willow Court after its closure\nhttp://www.willowcourttasmania.org/\nhttp://willowcourtproject.com/",

    "Aepytus of Messenia": "In Greek mythology, Aepytus (Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f35\u03c0\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2) was the youngest son of Cresphontes the Heraclid, king of Messenia, and of Merope, the daughter of the Arcadian king Cypselus.\n\n\n== Mythology ==\nCresphontes and his other sons were murdered during an insurrection, and Aepytus alone, who was educated in the house of his grandfather Cypselus, escaped the danger. The throne of Cresphontes was in the meantime occupied by the Heraclid Polyphontes, who also forced Merope to become his wife. When Aepytus had grown to manhood, he was enabled by the aid of Holaeas, his uncle, to return to his kingdom of Messenia, punish the murderers of his father, and put Polyphontes to death. He left a son, Glaucus, and it was from him that subsequently the kings of Messenia were called Aepytids instead of the more general name Heraclids.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nApollodorus, The Library with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1921.

    "Melody type": "Melody type or type-melody is a set of melodic formulas, figures, and patterns.\n\n\n== Term and typical meanings ==\n\"Melody type\" is a fundamental notion for understanding a nature of Western and non-Western musical modes, according to Harold Powers' seminal article \"Mode\" in the first edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (Powers 1980, 12:376\u201377, 379, et passim).\nMelody types are used in the composition of an enormous variety of music, especially non-Western and early Western music. Such music is generally composed by a process of centonization, either freely (i.e. improvised) or in a fixed pattern.\n\"Melody type\" as used by the ethnomusicologist Mark Slobin (1982, 186) is defined as a \"group of melodies that are related, in that they all contain similar modal procedures and characteristic rhythmic and melodic contours or patterns\".Most cultures which compose music in this way organize the patterns into distinct melody types. These are often compared to modern Western scales, but they in fact represent much more information than a sequence of permissible pitches, since they include how those pitches should function in the music, and indicate basic formulas which serve as a basis for improvisation. In non-improvised music, such as codified liturgical music, it is still usually clear how the melody developed from set patterns.\n\nOn one end of the continuum, the right, the melody type is a schema that is quite definite\u2014a specific melody or a tune. When a musician improvises on this schema, he [or she] plays the melody with only slight variations. The basic outline is preserved and is clearly recognized by the listener. The best example ... on this end of the continuum is a folk song. A genuine folk song performance is a kind of improvisation. No one person sings it exactly as it came to him [or her]. One of the challenges of folk song research, of course, is to find all the variants of the tune and to try to trace the family relationships. On the left side of the continuum is the melody type as a mode. Here the melody type is similar to a church mode: a scalar configuration with a preferential order of tones. ...The closer we get to the pole where a melody type is a tune, the more definite and literal is the schema.\nA melodic formula, ranging length from a short motif of a few notes to an entire melody, which is used as the basis for musical compositions. It differs from a mode, which simply sets forth a sequence of intervals (in Western music, half tones and whole tones), and from a scale (the notes of a mode in rising order of pitch), in that it is more specific: a melody type spells out actual sequences of tones, just as they are to appear in a piece, as well as particular beginnings and endings, ornaments, and other details. Melody types are found mostly in the music of ancient peoples\u2014the Greeks, Hebrews, and others\u2014and of Eastern peoples\u2014the Arabs, Persians (Iranians), Indians, and others. For...example... raga.\n\n\n== Melodic formulae and melody types in monodic traditions around the world ==\nNomos in Ancient Greek music\nIntonation formula (Latin: intonatio, euouae, Noeane etc.) in Gregorian chant as used in psalm tones and certain genres such as the Tract\nEnechema (Ancient Greek: \u1f10\u03bd\u03ae\u03c7\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1) in Byzantine chant\nPopevka (Russian: \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0432\u043a\u0430) in Znamenny chant\nKhaz in Armenian chant\nAll Near and Middle East maqam-traditions (Arabic Maqam, Turkish Makam, Kurdish Meqam, Uyghur Muqam, Azeri Mugam, Uzbek and Tadzhik Shashmakom,  Persian Dastgah etc.)\nRaga in Indian music\nPathet in Indonesian music\nCh\u014dshi in Japanese music\n\n\n== Extra-musical implications ==\nIn most cases, these melody types are associated with extra-musical implications, particularly emotions (see Indian rasa, for instance). They are also often associated with certain times.

    "Minott": "Lincoln Barrington \"Sugar\" Minott (25 May 1956 \u2013 10 July 2010) was a Jamaican reggae singer, producer and sound-system operator.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAfter working as a selector on the Sound of Silence Keystone sound system, and then his own Gathering of Youth system, he began his singing career as part of The African Brothers in 1969, along with Tony Tuff and Derrick Howard. The group released several singles in the first half of the 1970s on labels such as Micron and their own Ital label, and were an early example of the Rastafari movement's influence on the Jamaican music scene, taking a clear lead from The Abyssinians. After recording \"Mysterious Nature\" for producer Rupie Edwards, the group recorded 1974's \"No Cup No Broke\" for Studio One, breaking up shortly after.\nMinott then teamed up with the producer Clement \"Coxsone\" Dodd, as studio apprentice at Dodd's Studio One, working as a singer, guitarist and percussionist, and soon began recording his own singles. Minott developed a talent for writing new songs to fit over existing rhythms (which at the time was common when singers performed live, but rare in the studio), often proving more popular than the original songs, pioneering an approach that would be central to the emerging dancehall style.After a number of moderately successful hits for Studio One, such as \"Vanity\", \"Hang On Natty\", \"Mr. DC\", and \"Jah Jah Children\", his debut LP Live Loving made his name and increased his popularity, and is regarded as pioneering the dancehall style that would dominate the early 1980s. It was followed in 1979 with a second album, Showcase, which included his singles that had been omitted from the first album.\nThe Bittersweet album followed, and then the third album of 1979, Ghetto-ology, which saw a return to roots reggae.  Roots Lovers (1980) saw a move towards lovers rock, which was a UK hit. He became a bigger star in the UK than in Jamaica, his self-produced \"Hard Time Pressure\" being a major UK reggae hit in 1980, leading Minott to relocate to the UK, where he became a focus for UK reggae.Singles such as \"Run Come\", \"Not for Sale\", \"African Girl\", \"Lovers Rock\", \"In a Dis Ya Time\", \"Africa\" and \"Make It with You\" (with Carroll Thompson) were hits in the years that followed.  \"Good Thing Going\" (a cover of a song originally recorded by Michael Jackson in 1971) was picked up for distribution by RCA and reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart in March 1981, leading to an album of the same name. The Herbman Hustling album saw a return to dancehall and roots reggae.\nHe released an album of recordings from Channel One Studios, With Lots Of Extra in 1983, collecting several hits from his time working with Winston Holness.\nReturning to Jamaica, his Youth Promotion sound system performed regularly in Kingston's Maxfield Park, featuring Jah Stitch and newcomers who had been nurtured by his organization such as Ranking Joe, Captain Sinbad, and Ranking Dread. His Black Roots label featured his productions of these artists plus others such as Barry Brown, Tenor Saw, Little John, Tony Tuff, Barrington Levy, Horace Andy, and one of his discoveries from England, Trevor Hartley. Minott also produced early works by Nitty Gritty, Junior Reid, Yami Bolo, Colourman, Daddy Freddy and Garnett Silk.\nIn 1980s he was working with producers in Jamaica including, Mikey Dread, George Phang, Sly & Robbie, Philip \"Fatis\" Burrell, Channel One, Prince Jammy, and Donovan Germain, as well as recording for United States-based Lloyd \"Bullwackie\" Barnes (the Wicked A Go feel It album from 1984). His biggest hits included \"Herbman Hustling\", \"No Vacancy\", \"Jamming in the Street\", \"Rub A Dub Sound\", \"Buy Off The Bar\", \"Rydim\", and \"Devil's Pickney\".\nHe linked up with Sly & Robbie for 1984's \"Rub a Dub Sound Style\" single, which is regarded as a prototype for the ragga style that developed in the mid-1980s.Sugar Minott continued to record on his Black Roots label, Youth Promotion Label and for Major and Independent labels. His albums receive increasingly exciting reviews. He released over 60 albums and hundreds of singles.\nMinott is one of the artists who appeared on the (2006) record, Radiodread, released by the Easy Star label, he provided the guest vocals on the song \"Exit Music (For a Film)\".\nMinott's desire for independence led him to leave Studio One in 1978 and form his own Black Roots Records label and Youth Promotion organization, the latter with the aim of helping young singers from the same ghetto background as himself. Minott also ran the Youthman Promotion sound-system, giving young performers their first public exposure. Youthman Promotion has new selectors working alongside the veterans of Major Stitch, Ragga Steve and Drifter, Daddy Ants, Mr Shorty and Jimmy Knuckles. The selectors most recently added to the sound are DiGeneral Starry B in 2007, alongside Poochiny and Jr War, who were added in 2012. Ragga Steve has taken full control of the sound with Earl Minott in the UK.\n\n\n== Death ==\nMinott died on 10 July 2010 at the University Hospital of the West Indies in St. Andrew Parish, Jamaica, after being admitted earlier that day. The cause of death remains undisclosed. He had been affected by a heart condition since early 2009, and cancelled several performances in May 2010 due to chest pains.In May 2012, a charity concert was held at his former home commemorating his birthday, with Minott's children (who include daughter Tamar, aka Pashon) joined by Bounty Killer, Sizzla, Beenie Man, Junior Reid, Ken Boothe and John Holt. Proceeds went to the Youthman Promotions Music Centre and other causes helping local poor people.\n\n\n== Discography ==\nLive Loving (1977, Studio One) Roots Archives states 1977, Discogs says release year is unknown\nShowcase (1978, Studio One, probably a smaller edition in Jamaica by Studio One already 1977,); reissued in US as Showcase (1992, Heartbeat) with different mixing; reissued as Jah Jah Children 2012\nBlack Roots (1979, Black Roots Records & Gorgon Records in Jamaica; 1979 by Mango for US and 1980 by Island Records for UK and (Germany) with other, shorter names on the 10 songs).

    "Chuck Nelson": "Charles Nelson Reilly (January 13, 1931 \u2013 May 25, 2007) was an American actor, comedian, director, and drama teacher known for his comedic roles on stage, film, and television. Reilly performed in the original Broadway casts of Bye Bye Birdie, Hello, Dolly!, and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. His television credits include The Ghost & Mrs. Muir and Match Game. A recording of his autobiographical one-man play Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly was adapted into a 2006 independent film.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nReilly was born January 13, 1931, in The Bronx, to an Irish-Catholic father and a Swedish Lutheran mother. When young, he would amuse himself by creating puppet theater, and his mother often told him to \"save it for the stage\".At age 13, he survived the 1944 Hartford circus fire which killed 167 people in Connecticut, and he never sat in an audience again after that. Because of the event's trauma, he rarely attended theater, stating that the large crowds reminded him of what happened that day. As he often stated on The Tonight Show and other such venues, that even as the director of a play or stage production he preferred to sit at the back of the house or the back of a balcony near the exits to preview his work, including one time where his leading lady's costume caught fire (but on recounting this episode to Johnny, Reilly assured him \"but you know, these things always work out okay\").\nReilly developed a love of opera and wanted to become an opera singer. He entered the Hartt School of Music as a voice major, but abandoned this pursuit when he realized that he lacked the natural vocal talent to have a major career. However, opera remained a lifelong passion, and he was a frequent guest on opera-themed radio programs, including the Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts. He directed opera productions for the Chicago Opera Theater, Dallas Opera, Portland Opera, San Diego Opera, and Santa Fe Opera. He was good friends with opera singers Ren\u00e9e Fleming, Rod Gilfry, Roberta Peters, and Eileen Farrell.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Stage ===\nReilly made his film debut with an uncredited role in A Face in the Crowd (1957), directed by Elia Kazan, although most of his early career was spent on the stage. He was a regular performer in comic roles for several summer seasons in the 1950s at the Starlight Theatre in Kansas City, Missouri. Reilly appeared in many Off Broadway productions. His big break came in 1960 with the enormously successful original Broadway production of Bye Bye Birdie. In the groundbreaking musical, Reilly had a small onstage part, and was Dick Van Dyke's understudy/replacement for the leading role.In 1961, Reilly was in the original cast of another Broadway show, the Pulitzer prize-winning musical How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. For his memorable origination of the role of Bud Frump, Reilly earned a 1962 Tony Award for featured actor in a musical.In 1964, Reilly was in the original cast of Hello, Dolly!, another successful Broadway show. For originating the role of Cornelius Hackl, Reilly received a second nomination for a Tony Award for performance by an actor in a featured role in a musical.\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\nReilly kept active in Broadway shows but he became better known for his TV work, appearing regularly on television in the 1960s. He appeared as a Mystery Guest and was a panelist on the What's My Line? quiz show. In 1965 he appeared several times on The Steve Lawrence Show, which aired for a single season. Television commercials that he made throughout the 1960s and 1970s included Excedrin and Bic Banana Ink Crayons.\nFrom 1968 to 1970, he appeared as the bumbler Claymore Gregg on the television series The Ghost & Mrs. Muir, for which he received an Emmy nomination. He also appeared as a regular on The Dean Martin Show and had guest appearances on various television series, including McMillan & Wife, The Patty Duke Show, Here's Lucy, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, The Love Boat, and Love, American Style. In 1971, he appeared as the evil magician Hoodoo in Lidsville, a children's program on ABC.\nReilly was a frequent guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, appearing more than 100 times. He was a lively and reliable talk-show guest and lived within blocks of the Burbank studios where The Tonight Show was taped, so he was often asked to be a last-minute replacement for scheduled guests who did not make it to the studio in time.Reilly was a fixture on game shows, primarily due to his appearances as a regular panelist on Match Game. He was one of the longest-running guests, and often engaged in playful banter with fellow regular Brett Somers (the two generally sat next to each other on the show\u2014Somers in the upper middle seat and Reilly in the upper right seat). He typically offered sardonic commentary and peppered his answers with homosexuality-themed double entendres which pushed the boundaries of 1970s television standards.During the taping of Match Game '74, Reilly left for a short time to film Hamburgers (1974) and to star in the Neil Simon play God's Favorite. From 1975 to 1976, he starred in another live-action children's program titled Uncle Croc's Block, with Jonathan Harris. He was often a guest celebrity on the 1984 game show Body Language, including one week with Lucille Ball and another week with Audrey Landers.\n\n\n=== Later career ===\nFrom 1976, Reilly primarily taught acting and directing for television and theater, including directing Julie Harris (with whom he had acted in Skyscraper in 1965\u201366), who was portraying Emily Dickinson in her one-woman Broadway play The Belle of Amherst, by William Luce. In 1979, he directed Ira Levin's play Break a Leg on Broadway. Despite the previous year's success of Levin's Deathtrap, Break a Leg closed after one performance. Within days, Reilly appeared on The Tonight Show, joking and speaking at length about the show's failure, saying, \"So [a play] can open and last six years, eight years... or two hours and five minutes.\" Reilly earned a 1997 Tony Award nomination as Best Director of a Play for the revival of The Gin Game, starring Julie Harris.In 1990, he directed episodes of Evening Shade. Reilly also made guest appearances in the 1990s on The Drew Carey Show, The Larry Sanders Show, Family Matters, Second Noah, and as eccentric writer Jose Chung in the television series The X-Files (\"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\"), Millennium (\"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense\"), and occasionally as the voice of the Dirty Bubble in the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants before he was replaced by Tom Kenny. Reilly was nominated for Emmy Awards in 1998 and 1999 for his performances in The Drew Carey Show and Millennium, respectively.Reilly was a longtime teacher of acting at HB Studio, the acting studio founded by Herbert Berghof and made famous by Berghof and his wife, the renowned stage actress Uta Hagen. His acting students included Lily Tomlin, Bette Midler, and Gary Burghoff.Reilly had a voice role in three films by Don Bluth: All Dogs Go to Heaven as Killer in 1989, Rock-a-Doodle as Hunch in 1991, and A Troll in Central Park as King Llort in 1994. In each one, he played the villain's dim-witted sidekick.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nMagazine and newspaper profiles of Reilly throughout the 1970s and 1980s did not mention his personal life or sexuality. Years after the cancellation of Match Game, he revealed his homosexuality in his theatrical one-man show Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly.Much like fellow actor and game-show regular Paul Lynde of the same era, despite Reilly's off-camera silence, he gave signals on-camera of a campy persona. In many episodes of Match Game, he lampooned himself by briefly affecting \"YO!\" in a deep voice and the nickname \"Chuck\" and self-consciously describing how \"butch\" he was. Many years after his game show career ended, he mentioned in a 2002 interview with Entertainment Tonight that he felt no need to explain his jokes about Chuck and that he never purposely hid being gay from anyone. Patrick Hughes, a set decorator and dresser, was Reilly's domestic partner; the two met backstage while Reilly appeared on the game show Battlestars, although their partnership was not revealed publicly. They lived together in Beverly Hills.Reilly did appear on several episodes of the game show Tattletales with actress Elizabeth Allen as a couple, though their \"relationship\" was never discussed on the air.\nReilly was associated with the United States Coast Guard and made at least two films in conjunction with the Coast Guard. He regularly advertised National Safe Boating Week as a panelist on Match Game. Reilly died on May 25, 2007; the last day of 2007's National Safe Boating Week.Despite sporting what appeared to be a full head of hair for most of the prime of his television career, Reilly was in fact bald, wearing a toup\u00e9e throughout most of his appearances in the 1970s and 1980s. During the taping of Match Game '74, his toup\u00e9e became a joke when Reilly had to go to New York City to have his toup\u00e9e adjusted. During the taping of several episodes, Reilly was seen wearing different hats because his toup\u00e9e was back in New York waiting for him to be fitted. This was the start of the long-running jokes on Match Game about his hair. He abandoned the toup\u00e9e in the late 1990s and appeared bald in all of his subsequent public events. He dramatized the experience in his stage show The Life of Reilly. In one episode of Match Game '78, he took off his toup\u00e9e and gave it to a bald contestant by putting it on his head. One can briefly see Reilly's bald head before he covers it up with a hat.\n\n\n== Final years and death ==\nReilly spent his later life primarily touring the U.S. directing theater and opera, and offering audiences a glimpse into his background and personal life with a critically acclaimed one-man play chronicling his life, titled Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly. In 2004, his final two performances of his play in North Hollywood, California, were recorded as the basis of an autobiographical independent film titled The Life of Reilly.Reilly was stricken with respiratory problems while filming The Life of Reilly, and retired from directing and performing immediately after the final day of shooting in 2004. The movie premiered in March 2006 at the South by Southwest film festival, and Reilly's film performance was acclaimed. He canceled his personal appearance at South by Southwest due to illness, and by the time the film premiered, he had been hospitalized. Reilly died of complications from pneumonia at the UCLA Medical Center on May 25, 2007, and his body was cremated. That weekend, the Game Show Network dedicated its programming to Reilly, airing some of his funniest episodes of Match Game.\n\n\n== Select filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Tiger Makes Out (1967) \u2013 Registrar\nCannonball Run II (1984) \u2013 Don Don Canneloni\nThe Wind in the Willows (TV) (1987) \u2013 Mr. Toad\nBody Slam (1987) \u2013 Vic Carson\nAll Dogs Go to Heaven (1989) \u2013 Killer\nRock-a-Doodle (1991) \u2013 Hunch\nA Troll in Central Park (1994) \u2013 Llort\nBabes in Toyland (1997) \u2013 Humpty Dumpty\nAn All Dogs Christmas Carol (1998) \u2013 Killer\nThe First of May (1998) \u2013 Dinghy\nGaydar (2002) \u2013 Uncle Vincent\nTom and Jerry: Shiver Me Whiskers (2006) \u2013 Red Parrot Stan\nThe Life of Reilly (2007)\n\n\n=== Stage ===\nBye Bye Birdie (1960\u201361) \u2013 Mr. Henkel/Albert Peterson's understudy\nHow to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1961\u201365) \u2013 Bud Frump\nHello, Dolly!

A later Baldwin character, the Generalissimo from 30 Rock, mentions both Julie Harris and The Belle of Amherst, which Reilly had directed. A 2008 parody of Match Game on Saturday Night Live included Fred Armisen playing a Reilly-like character. In the sketch, the host is found murdered moments before the show's taping; the subsequent on-air police investigation reveals that he had been having a clandestine homosexual affair with the Reilly character. Baldwin briefly reprised his portrayal of Reilly in the 30 Rock episode \"Live from Studio 6H\" (West Coast airing), appearing on the \"joke wall\" in a parody of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.\"Weird Al\" Yankovic wrote and recorded a tribute song titled \"CNR\", jokingly caricaturing Reilly with parodies of the internet phenomenon Chuck Norris Facts, with absurdities like winning the Tour de France \"with two flat tires and a missing chain\", or how \"every day he'd make the host of Match Game give him a two-hour piggyback ride\". This was part of Yankovic's digital Internet Leaks EP, and was included on the 2011 CD release Alpocalypse. The music video was released by JibJab on August 4, 2009.In season two, episode one of The Life and Times of Tim, one character observes another acting a line from their play and says, \"I saw Charles Nelson Reilly do that, and you did it better.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCharles Nelson Reilly at Find a Grave\nCharles Nelson Reilly at the Internet Broadway Database\nCharles Nelson Reilly at IMDb\nCharles Nelson Reilly at the TCM Movie Database\nCharles Nelson Reilly at the Internet Off-Broadway Database\nThe Final Taxi podcast on Charles Nelson Reilly\nCharles Nelson Reilly on DVD, plus Alec Baldwin's SNL impression\nHome video: \"Our dinner with Charles Nelson Reilly\" on YouTube\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's video, CNR on YouTube\nInterview with Charles Nelson Reilly by Bruce Duffie, April 17, 1988 (Mostly about directing opera, and stories about opera singers)",
    "Battle of Cixi": "The Battle of Cixi (no relation to the reigning Empress at the time) or Battle of Tzeki (\u6148\u6eaa\u4e4b\u6230) was a victory for Qing imperial forces led by American soldier of fortune Frederick Townsend Ward against Taiping Rebels in late Qing dynasty China.  By 1862 Ward, who recently scored several victories for the imperial forces, had raised an army for the defense of Shanghai.  On 20 September he attacked the walled city of Cixi (Tzeki) ten miles outside Ningbo.  During the attack Ward was mortally wounded but remained in the field until victory was assured.  He died the next day and command of his army: British COL Forrester, (Ward's second in command), declined the honor to lead the Forces.\nThat led to Henry Burgevine, a Carolinian who took over as CO of the Command's Forces. It took many weeks before Burgevine would take to the field. He drank a lot at night, he was certainly confronted by the huge task before him, and it was truly much greater than he could bear. Burgevine did not get along well with the other senior leaders, however he tried his best and did lead the forces out, but circumstances overwhelmed him. The Russians tried to interfere, sensing perhaps a vacuum was occurring in China, and their forces might intercede. That was quashed by the British Forces and financial interests that funded the Ever Victorious Army. Burgevine struggled under the difficulty of taking over from a personality such as General Ward. Burgvine found himself thrust into a leadership position, and had no one like Ward to lean upon, and he himself realized he was intellectually ill-suited for the task at hand.Burgevine was no Ward, however he took over leadership, but his personal behavior and temperament was in conflict with the good order and discipline necessary to lead a mixed group of mercenary forces in this ever-changing war. It was unlike any other Civil War the world had ever experienced! Even to this day and time. His uncouth behaviour got him into great deal of trouble, as he could not lead as Ward had led the Ever Victorious Army (EVA) throughout all previous Battles. logistics. Arguments with late pay created a situation in which he used force to get the money the forces needed, and that developed into an international incident which blew up tremendously and led to the leadership being taken over by the British, which led to the group being re-formed under new leadership by a British Major Charles G. Gordon (Chinese Gordon).\n\n\n== Background ==\nWhen Shanghai was successively attacked by Taiping Rebels in 1862, western inhabitants favored removing the potential threat and cooperating with imperial forces; as a result, combined British and French naval troops under the command of Adm. James Hope were involved in military conflict with the Taiping Rebellion.  One of the communities inhabited by the rebels was Ningbo, a port and walled city located south of Hangzhou Bay.\nThe imperial army laid siege to Ningbo's occupiers on 6 May.  After a false flag attack on the British ships docked outside Ningbo, the western ships began bombarding the Taiping. They then sent their crews into the city, overpowering rebel forces and turning over Ningbo to the imperial army.  With Ningbo secure, Ward's soldiers and the Qing forces began launching attacks in the surrounding areas against the rebels.  During this time Cixi was one of the encircling cities ravaged by violence.\n\n\n== Battle ==\nThe Ever Victorious Army attacked Cixi on 20 September. As well as being trained in artillery and rifle usage, they were accompanied by the gunboats H.M.S. Hardy and Confucius. Ward led from the front and was hit in the stomach by a musket ball. However, he remained on the battlefield until victory was certain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nCompton's Home Library: Battles of the World\nHahn Boxer, E.

    "Nicola Luisotti": "Nicola Luisotti (born 26 November 1961, Viareggio, Italy) is an Italian conductor.  He currently holds the title \"Director Principal Invitado\" (principal guest conductor) of Madrid's Teatro Real.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLuisotti grew up in Bargecchia.  He began studying music as a child, with lessons on the church organ.  A seminary student until age 14, he was the director of his village church choir by age 11.  He later trained as a pianist, with secondary degrees in composition, trumpet and voice.  Upon completing his formal study, he traveled between Milan, where he was a rehearsal pianist for La Scala, and Florence, where he was a member of the chorus of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Subsequent posts allowed him to assist such conductors as Lorin Maazel and Riccardo Muti at La Scala.  His earliest full-time position was as chorus master for La Fenice in Venice.\nLuisotti's first professional opera conducting engagements were a 2000 production of Stiffelio in Trieste and a 2001 Staatstheater Stuttgart production of Il trovatore.  Luisotti became Stuttgart's main conductor for the Italian repertory, conducting Tosca, Turandot, Madama Butterfly and Otello in 2006. His Stuttgart Il trovatore was met with critical acclaim, and within weeks he was offered a debut engagement at Paris Opera.  Other early invitations came from the Canadian Opera Company (Un ballo in maschera in 2003), Genoa's Teatro Carlo Felice (Il viaggio a Reims in 2003 and Simon Boccanegra in 2004), and Munich's Bavarian State Opera (Tosca in 2004).  He made his debut in Japan with a staged production of Tosca at Suntory Hall.\n\nLuisotti made his San Francisco Opera debut in 2005 conducting La forza del destino.  In January 2007, the company announced his appointment as its third music director, effective with the 2009-2010 season, with an initial contract of 5 years.  His work at San Francisco Opera has included conducting the premiere of Marco Tutino's La Ciociara (Two Women).

    "Scranton Cultural Center": "The Scranton Cultural Center at the Masonic Temple (formerly the Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral) is a theatre and cultural center in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The Cultural Center's mission statement is \"to rejuvenate a national architectural structure as a regional center for arts, education and community activities appealing to all ages.\" The Cultural Center hosts national Broadway tours; professional and local musical and dramatic theatre offerings; local, regional and national orchestral and popular music, dance and opera; comedians, lecturers, art exhibits, a children's and performing arts academy and various classes as well as fundraiser galas and special events including proms, luncheons, private parties and is a popular wedding ceremony and reception venue. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n== History ==\nArchitect Raymond Hood, with Godley & Fouilhoux  and Harry V. K. Henderson, designed the Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, which houses the Scranton Cultural Center, the current operating organization for the building. The Masonic Temple is designed in a combination of Gothic Revival architecture and Romanesque Revival\u2014Richardsonian Romanesque with contemporary Art Deco influences. The building was completed in 1930. The temple was designed with a dual nature; it was built to house the Scottish Rite Cathedral and a Masonic lodge while housing spaces (primarily the theater and ballroom) that were intended for public use. The design of the building is a tribute to Freemasonry.\nThe Masonic Temple houses: The Harry and Jeannette Weinberg Theatre which seats 1,866 for concerts, lectures, national Broadway tours, dance and other entertainment; the Governor Robert P. Casey Library; the Raymond Hood Room (renovated from the original bowling alley); a Junior Ballroom, utilized both as event space and for the Children's and Performing Arts Academy summer and after school programs; a Grand Ballroom which can hold 2,400 for standing room performances and is host to elegant weddings, community fundraisers and galas -it was designed to seat 1,000 for dinner and was the largest ballroom in the region at the time; a \"Ladies Parlor\" overlooking the Grand Ballroom; Shopland Hall (originally Norman Hall), a 500-seat theatre and lodge hall located on the 4th floor, Craftsmen Hall (originally the gaming and billiard room) on the 3rd Floor as well as Snyder and Gazda Hall (originally Tuscan and Flemish Halls - named for their decor) which serve as the primary Lodge rooms for the Masonic Fraternity. Both the Weinberg Theatre and Shopland Hall are equipped with Austin Organs (numbers 1713 and 1712 respectively). Most of the facility is open for public usage and rental through the year.  Visitors to Scranton can visit the Temple and take a tour that highlights the architecture of the building as well as its present-day uses.\n\n\n== Performances ==\nThe Cultural Center features a wide variety of entertainments and programs. It has hosted performances by contemporary musical artists, including Alice Cooper, Jason Mraz, Dave Matthews, N Sync, Breaking Benjamin, Backstreet Boys, and Maroon 5. Performances from Jackson Browne, Lewis Black, Jeff Dunham, Shinedown, George Carlin, and The Amazing Kreskin have entertained in recent years, the venue has played host to the regional Northeastern Pennsylvania Philharmonic Orchestra and many others. The Broadway Theatre League of Northeastern Pennsylvania has produced an annual season of national Broadway tours for over 50 years at the venue, including \"Rent,\" \"Cats,\" \"Mamma Mia!,\" \"Les Miserables,\" \"Jersey Boys,\" and \"The Book of Mormon.\" In December 2014, the Scranton Cultural Center premiered the fully realized stage version of the musical comedy, Harry Connick Jr.'s \"The Happy Elf.\"\n\n\n== Description ==\nConstruction of the Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral was begun in 1927 on the site of two former mansions. Construction of the building took three years with the Temple inauguration taking place on January 2, 1930 when the first meeting was held in the building; it was formally dedicated in May 1930. The rectangular plan building is clad in coursed ashlars of Indiana limestone supported by the structural steel framework.  At approximately 188,000 square feet (17,500 m2), the building houses two theaters, public and masonic meeting rooms and event spaces, a grand ballroom, as well as numerous other offices, rooms and areas.  There are ten levels of the building, five of which can be accessed by elevator.  The remaining five levels include a storage and dressing room floor, penthouse for elevator equipment and storage, a small light room in the northwest corner of the main core, and a two-level sub-basement sixty feet below the basement floor.\n\n\n== Masonic symbols ==\nSymbols of Masonry can be found throughout the Masonic Temple and Scottish Rite Cathedral, although it may not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the Craft.  Shopland Hall, the small theater on the fourth floor, contains many Masonic symbols.  An image of the Crusade is depicted above the stage, as well as shield motifs.  These are important symbols to the Masonic Fraternity. Two-headed eagles are depicted on the ceiling of the theater. Frederick of Prussia introduced the symbol of the two headed eagle when the Scottish Rite was in its formative stages. The two-headed eagle, along with other symbols of various branches as well as the four cardinal virtues are engraved on the exterior of the building. The Robert P. Casey Library features a quintessential symbol of the Freemasons, a shovel, a pick, and a crowbar, in a glass case.  Not only are these three items symbols of Masonry, but they were also used in the ceremonial groundbreaking and the accompanying ceremonial trowel was used in the laying of the cornerstone during the construction of the Masonic Temple. Also in the Casey Library is a grandfather clock that features many Masonic Symbols carved into the wood, including the shovel, pick, and crowbar motif, as well as the symbol of the square and the compass with letter \u201cG\u201d in the center.\n\n\n== Future ==\nThe Scranton Cultural Center began a multimillion-dollar restoration project in the mid-1990s. Electrical services were updated and air conditioning was installed for the theatre, grand ballroom, main lobby and lower level. Expanded and ADA compliant restrooms were added and the new Raymond Hood Room were installed in the former bowling lanes space. The ballroom's ornate walls and ceilings were also restored. In 2014, the Junior Ballroom was updated to provide space for the newly begun children and youth theatre program classes and summer camp sessions, including improvements for mobility access. In the spring of 2015, air conditioning was added to Shopland Hall and the third floor lodge rooms. Roof and masonry repairs, further HVAC upgrades and expansion, plumbing upgrades, as well as updates and restoration to the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Theatre, main organ, and stage house and mechanics are slated for the coming years.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Arthur G. Sorlie": "Arthur Gustave Sorlie (April 26, 1874 \u2013 August 28, 1928) was an American businessman and politician who served as the 14th Governor of North Dakota from 1925 until his death in 1928 at the age of 54.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nSorlie was born in Albert Lea, Minnesota and resided in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He was the son of Iver Jacobson Sorlie (1835-1916) and Maren Oline Olson (1841-1917), both immigrants from Norway.  He graduated from Luther Academy at Albert Lea, Minnesota in 1893.   He worked in a bank and managed a general store in Buxton, North Dakota. In 1903, Sorlie opened a bread and cracker factory in Grand Forks, North Dakota. He became a successful businessman, owning car dealerships and gas stations. Sorlie first entered politics as a member of the Grand Forks City Council, a position he held two terms.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\nSorlie defeated incumbent Ragnvald A. Nestos in the 1924 gubernatorial race. At that time, North Dakota politics involved the struggle between the Nonpartisan League (NPL) and the Independent Voters Association (IVA). The NPL membership (primarily farm and rural) bitterly opposed big business interests. They favored state-owned industries such as the Bank of North Dakota and the State Mill and Elevator. The IVA did not support state ownership of industry. They considered the NPL platform to be too radical and socialist.\nWhen NPL-backed Sorlie replaced IVA candidate Nestos, the Nonpartisan League returned to power in the state. However, Sorlie did not have complete support from the League. Some (such as his own lieutenant governor, Walter Maddock) opposed Sorlie because he was a conservative businessman. During the 1927 legislative session, Sorlie's political enemies conspired to embarrass him by publicly investigating the State Mill and Elevator and calling for its removal from the governor's influence because of inefficient management.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1900, he was married to Jennie Odegard  (1879-1918) with whom he had three children. After the death of his first wife, he married Grace Hilleboe  (1889-1965) with whom he had an additional three children. When Governor Sorlie died in office in 1928, his body lay in state in the rotunda of the North Dakota State Capitol. He is buried in Memorial Park Cemetery in Grand Forks, Grand Forks County, North Dakota.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe Sorlie Memorial Bridge in Grand Forks, North Dakota was named in his memory.

    "Hero System Bestiary": "Hero System Bestiary is a compilation of creatures for use with Hero System role-playing game rules. It takes the form of a bestiary. It was published in 2002 for the 5th edition Hero System release. The cover is thick paper and illustrated in color, while the interior is 239 pages in length and illustrated in black and white. An earlier edition of The Hero System Bestiary was published in 1992 for the prior edition of Hero.\nThis work is divided into four chapters and an appendix. The first chapter gives an overview of creatures in a role-playing game, along with descriptions of the game system statistics and how creatures are created using the Hero System point build method. Each of the skills common to animals is described in terms of how it is applied to the various life forms. The application of powers and their limitations is detailed specifically for creatures such as animals, and the various disadvantages are explained in terms of how they are best applied.\nNew with this release is a section in chapter one on Creature Templates. These are sets of powers with appropriate advantages and limitations that can be applied to modify a creature. Thus there are templates for size modification, elemental forms, undead, venomous creatures, disease carriers, mutations, and so forth. These templates significantly multiply the variety of creatures available to the game master.\nThe first chapter also has a section on how creatures fight and behave in combat, as well as providing custom hit location tables for common creature forms that differ from a humanoid shape. The chapter closes with some comments on animal populations, as well as the commercial value of various animal parts.\nThe remaining three chapters consist of creature statistics and descriptions for fantastic beasts, animals, and beasts of science fiction and the films. Each creature description is about a page in length, and contains a complete listing of the characteristics, powers, skills, and disadvantages, including the point cost for each. This is followed by brief descriptions of the creature's ecology, personality and motivation, powers and combat tactics, their appearance, and the uses of the creature in a role-playing game campaign. The creatures listed include a number that are as intelligent as man (or more so), and can possess their own intricate cultures. All of the creatures are illustrated in black and white.\nThe book closes with a bibliography and an appendix. The latter includes various sample template-modified creatures, an extensive list of hit location tables, area of effect maps for various powers, and a creature summary table. At the end is an index.\nAltogether the book includes complete statistics for the following creatures:\n\nFantastic Beasts \u2014 guardian ape, basilisk, giant vampire bat, centaur, chimera (mythology), cockatrice, giant crab, deadly ooze, various demons and devils, dragons, elementals, giant frog, gargoyle, golems, gorgon, griffin, harpy, hippocampus, hippogriff, homunculus, hydra, giant insects, jackalope, kraken, giant lizard, lycanthropes, manticore, minotaur, pegasus, Phoenix, rakshasa, giant rat, roc, salamander, satyr, sea serpent, simurgh, siren, fantastic snakes, sphinx, tree man, undead (ghost, ghoul, mummy, animated skeleton, vampire, and zombie), unicorn, giant wolf, and giant worm.\nMundane Beasts \u2014 barracuda, bat, bears, birds of prey, other birds, boar, buffalo, camel, domestic cat, great cats (cheetah, leopard, lion, smilodon, and tiger), chimpanzee, giant clam, crocodile, deer, dinosaurs, dogs, dolphin, eel, elephant, gorilla, hippopotamus, horses, small mammals, rhinoceros, scorpion, sharks, snakes, spiders, animal swarms, swordfish, whales, and wolves.\nBeasts of Science Fiction and the Movies \u2014 amorphous horror, animal-men, giant ape, chromedog, engine of destruction, giant carnivorous plants, giant dinosaur, giant space amoeba, living brain, mon'da hunting lizard, neuroparasite, psychovore, robots and androids, slasher, swamp creature, and xenovore creatures.\n\n\n== Reviews ==\nPyramid\nDigital Hero #2 (July 2002)\n\n\n== References ==\n\nSteven S.

    "Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet": "Sir Christopher Hawkins, 1st Baronet FRS (29 May 1758\t\u2013 6 April 1829) was a Cornish landowner, mine-owner, Tory Member of Parliament, and patron of steam power. He was Recorder of Grampound, of Tregony, and of St Ives, Cornwall.\n\n\n== The Hawkins family ==\nChristopher Hawkins was the second son of Thomas Hawkins of Trewithen, a considerable landowner and former MP for Grampound. Thomas Hawkins had a lifelong fear of smallpox and died following an inoculation to prevent it. Christopher's elder brother John was drowned in the River Thames whilst at Eton, whilst a younger brother Thomas died \"of a fever in consequence of eating an ice-cream after dancing.\" His youngest brother, John Hawkins, survived and became a noted geologist. On his father's death in 1766, Christopher inherited his estates.\n\n\n== Career as MP ==\nHawkins was appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1783. He then followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a member of parliament at the age of 26. He subsequently earned notoriety as the leading commoner engaged in 'boroughmongering', the purchase and sale of rotten boroughs, parliamentary constituencies that had very few electors and as a result could be bought and sold through patronage, influence, and straightforward bribery. At his peak, Hawkins wholly or partly controlled six such boroughs, each returning two MPs, giving him the ability to ensure the successful election of candidates in return for cash or favours. He normally reserved these seats for government (Tory party) supporters.He himself was MP for several of his own Cornish boroughs, namely Grampound from 1800 to 1807, Mitchell from 1784 to 1799 and again from 1806 to 1807, Penryn from 1806 to 1807 and again from 1818 to 1820, and St Ives from 1821 to 1828. His appearances in the chamber of the house were not memorable. He appears to have spoken just four times: once very briefly in 1807, when charged with bribery he left \"his case entirely to the justice and liberality of the house\", twice in 1819 with regard to the Penryn Bribery Bill, when, according to Hansard, he was on both occasions \"quite inaudible\", and once in 1827 when he was \"totally inaudible\".\n\n\n=== Later Scandal ===\nFollowing the 1806 Penryn election, Hawkins was found guilty of bribery by a parliamentary committee and dispossessed of his seat, but unusually was not barred from the House. Since he had also been elected MP for Grampound and for Mitchell, he remained in the House of Commons, albeit under considerable censure. The Attorney General had been asked to take up the charge and Hawkins was sent for trial at Bodmin Assize Court in 1808, but was there acquitted. The political reformer William Cobbett attended and reported on the trial, and was less than impressed by its outcome. In 1810, the bribery charge and ensuing bad feeling led to Hawkins fighting a duel with his fellow boroughmonger and former Whig MP for Penryn Lord Dunstanville. Neither party was injured.\nHawkins earned himself a reputation as a miser and it was claimed that, to reduce election expenses, he pulled down the houses of electors on his land thus depriving them of the right to vote. In this way, he was said to have reduced the number of electors at Mitchell to three.\n\n\n=== Father of the House ===\nFor his loyal service to the Tory government, he was created a baronet in 1791 by William Pitt the Younger and by the time of his death had become Father of the House.\n\n\n== Land and mine-owner ==\nSir Christopher inherited considerable estates from his father, but assiduously purchased additional land, eventually claiming that he could \"ride from one side of Cornwall to the other without setting hoof on another man's soil.\" He bought well over a dozen manors, many of them \u2013 such as the manors of Grampound, of Mitchell, and of St Ives \u2013 to gain possession of rotten boroughs.He acquired the manors of Cargoll and of Trelundra to further his interests in Mitchell, but whilst attempting to improve some wasteland in Cargoll by deep-ploughing, lead ore was discovered. Sir Christopher set up the Old Shepherds Mine to exploit the lead and found additional silver, making the mine a considerable source of profit before it closed in 1820. In 1818 he opened a copper and tin mine at St Ives, later known as St Ives Consols. At his stream works at Ladock, near Grampound, gold was found as well as tin. A specimen of Ladock gold was presented to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall by Sir Christopher, who also published observations on the find in their Transactions. Sir Christopher was a partner in the Cornish Copper Company which established a smelting works at Copperhouse, built a canal to Hayle and extended the harbour there to export metal and import coal, timber, and other goods. He owned china clay mines in the St Austell area and substantially rebuilt the harbour at Pentewan to serve as a china clay port, connected to St Austell by the Pentewan Railway, a horse-drawn tramway.Sir Christopher obtained the post of Vice Lord Warden of the Stannaries, giving him considerable influence and control over mines and mining in Cornwall.\n\n\n=== Trewithen House and gardens ===\n\nThe family home of Trewithen, near Probus, was purchased by Philip Hawkins of Trewinnard in 1715 and substantially and grandly rebuilt. His nephew, Sir Christopher's father, inherited the house in 1738 and was responsible for much of its landscaping. Sir Christopher, known locally as \"Sir Kit\", extended the grounds but added little to the house,  reinforcing his reputation as a miser among his local tenants. The following verse was said to have been fixed to the gates of Trewithen:\nA large house, and no cheer,\nA large park, and no deer,\nA large cellar, and no beer,\nSir Christopher Hawkins lives here.Trewithen House, now a Grade I listed building, is still privately owned by a family descendant. It houses a portrait of Sir Christopher and is open to the public. The dairy farm at Trewithen supplies milk for the production of the ice cream made by Kelly's of Cornwall in Bodmin.\n\nThe garden at Trewithen was made by G. H. Johnstone VMH; it covers about 23 acres and is noted for its design and for the large collection of camellias, magnolias and rhododendrons.\n\n\n== Patron of steam, horticulture, and antiquarian pursuits ==\nSir Christopher was a Fellow of the Royal Society, of what was to become the Royal Horticultural Society, and of the Antiquarian Society. He was also a life subscriber to the Royal Institution.In 1811 he published a short book entitled Observations on the Tin Trade of the Ancients in Cornwall, concerning his theories on the involvement of the Phoenicians in the mining and trading of Cornish tin.Sir Christopher was a patron and supporter of the Cornish steam pioneer Richard Trevithick and in 1812 commissioned from him the world's first steam threshing machine, powered by a \"semi-portable\" barn engine.

Along with his wife Indira Jaising, he is a founder-member of the Lawyers Collective. He was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health from August 2008 to July 2014. He is currently and acting member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy. \n\n\n== Notable cases ==\nWith the Lawyers Collective Grover led the Naz Foundation's legal case for the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which was a law criminalizing homosexuality in India.Grover led the Lawyers Collective court case against Novartis regarding an interpretation of Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights which would determine the patent status of antiretroviral drugs in India.  The result of the case was that the Lawyers Collective prevailed and certain drugs became ineligible for patenting, thus keeping the price of the medications in line with generic medication costs.Grover represented the Cancer Patients Aid Association as an attorney and won the legal fight against drug maker Novartis on the issue of patent of cancer drug Glivec.\nOn the night before Yakub Memon was scheduled to be executed, Anand Grover along with other senior lawyers of the Supreme Court, sought appointment from the Chief Justice of India, H. L. Dattu at his residence. After the Chief Justice constituted a 3 Judge bench, Grover argued for the mandatory 14-day period between the rejection of the mercy plea of a condemned prisoner, and the execution of the death warrant, as per the guidelines set by the Supreme Court of India in the Shatrughan Chauhan vs Union of India case. Grover argued that an earlier mercy petition submitted to the President was by his brother, and that since all the legal remedies available to the prisoner, including a curative petition, stood exhausted only a day before his scheduled hanging, only the final mercy petition submitted by Yakub himself must be taken into account while evaluating upon the 14-day period. However the Supreme Court rejected the argument noting that Yakub had not disowned the earlier mercy petition by his brother. The bench commented that delaying Yakub's hanging anymore would amount to travesty of justice. Grover expressed disappointment and unhappiness over the judgement and termed it as a tragic mistake.Grover represented Shreya Tripathi in her successful efforts to obtain bedaquiline for the treatment of her extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n\n== United Nations work ==\nGrover is a member of the UNAIDS Reference Group on HIV and Human Rights and a Special Rapporteur in the United Nations Human Rights Council.

She was arrested on pimping charges in 1976. A police investigation soon revealed that many of Hopp's customers were well-known politicians and other dignitaries.\nIn November 1977, the newspaper Dagens Nyheter published allegations citing Justice Minister Lennart Geijer as one of Doris Hopp's customers. The newspaper claimed as its source a classified report in which the chief of police Carl Persson had informed Prime Minister Olof Palme of the involvement of politicians in the prostitution scandal. At the time of the scandal broke, it was legal to pay for sexual services, but the fact that politicians socialized with prostitutes was viewed as a security risk as staff from foreign embassies were also reported to frequent the brothel.\nPrime Minister Palme strongly denied the allegations, accusing the newspaper of aggravated libel. The newspaper was forced into a retreat and two days after the publication Lennart Geijer received an official apology. Years later, it emerged that a few minor details aside, the newspaper's assertions had in fact been largely correct. Over the years, there has been much speculation regarding the identities of those who made use of the brothel's services. Former Prime Minister Thorbj\u00f6rn F\u00e4lldin and former Centre Party leader Olof Johansson have both publicly denied frequenting Doris Hopp's brothel.\n\n\n== References ==\nPersson, Carl G.; Sundelin, Anders (1990).

(For his family tree, see Weizs\u00e4cker.)\nHe studied at T\u00fcbingen, Freiburg, Berlin, and Heidelberg, where he earned his medical degree in 1910. In 1920 he became head of the neurological department at Ludolf von Krehl's clinic in Heidelberg. In 1941 he succeeded Otfrid Foerster as professor of neurology in Breslau, and in 1945 returned to Heidelberg as a professor of clinical medicine.\nWeizs\u00e4cker is known for his pioneer work in psychosomatic medicine, and for his theories regarding medical anthropology. He is remembered for his concept of Gestaltkreis, an elaboration of Gestalt psychology, in which he explains that biological events are not fixed responses, but are dependent upon previous experience and are constantly being repatterned through experience. Via Gestalt, Weizs\u00e4cker attempted to represent the unit of perception and movement theoretically.\nIn the late 1920s Weizs\u00e4cker was co-editor of Die Kreatur with philosopher Martin Buber (1878-1965) and theologian Joseph Wittig (1879-1949). In this journal, Weizs\u00e4cker advances his ideas concerning medical anthropology. In 1956 he published Pathosophie, where he tries to create a philosophical understanding of man through his drives, conflicts, and illnesses.\n\n\n== Published works ==\n\"Der Gestaltkreis, Theorie der Einheit von Wahrnehmen und Bewegen\", 1940.\n\"Gestalt und Zeit : nach einem am 17. 1. 1942 gehaltenen Vortrage\", 1942.\n\"Begegnungen und Entscheidungen\", 1949.\n\"Menschenf\u00fchrung : nach ihren biologischen und metaphysischen Grundlagen betrachtet\", 1955.\n\"Am Anfang schuf Gott Himmel und Erde : Grundfragen der Naturphilosophie\", 1954.\n\"Natur und Geist; Errinnerungen eines Arztes\", 1954.\n\"Pathosophie\", 1955.Books about Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker:\n\"Viktor von Weizs\u00e4cker (1886-1957) : Materialien zu Leben und Werk\" : (Dokumentationsband zur Ausstellung; Heidelberg, 28.

    "Coventry Very Light Rail": "Coventry Very Light Rail (CVLR) is a light rail tram system proposed to operate in Coventry, England. The system has been promoted as being the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. When finished, it will also be the first tram network to operate in Coventry since the Second World War.Plans to establish such a system were first revealed during 2016; development work was headed by the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG) and Transport Design International (TDI).  Operational responsibility for the scheme has been assigned to Transport for West Midlands (TfWM). It was designed to be substantially cheaper to establish than conventional tramways and light railways, making use of batteries to avoid installing expensive overhead line equipment along much of the route, along with light rails that are easy to install and repair. The system is reportedly to be compatible with that of the West Midlands Metro mass transit system.\nDuring early 2018, WMG started formalising its procurement arrangements with various industrial partners to complete development and produce the vehicle. Construction of the first prototype vehicle is scheduled to be completed and start initial testing during the second half of 2020, while delivery is set to occur during 2021. During 2019, it was announced that the first line of the system was planned to be operational by 2024. Further expansion of the network is intended after this point to cover various commercial, residential, and industrial districts of Coventry, as well as linking up with other transit hubs.\n\n\n== Background ==\nProposals for Coventry to adopt this technology were first publicly revealed during 2016. The concept for this mass transit system originated from the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), an institution that is closely associated with the University of Warwick; much of the system's early development was performed by the group prior to other entities becoming involved. In January 2018, WMG commenced its procurement process, in which various industry partners were selected to develop and produce aspects of the vehicle. During June 2018, it was announced that WMG had awarded a contract to the Stratford-upon-Avon based transport specialist  Transport Design International (TDI). In accordance with this selection, TDI has been assigned overall responsibility for the design and manufacture of the vehicles, working in close cooperation with WMG to do so.Further elements of the system have been contracted to numerous third parties. Tikab & Arogus will perform both the design and manufacture of both the bogies and the control systems. Transcal is responsible for producing miscellaneous metal fabricated elements, along with the seating and interior fittings. Transport for West Midlands (TfWM) had been appointed to as the lead authority on all operational aspects of the system. That same month, it was suggested that an initial section of the system, running between the railway station and the city centre, could open as early as 2021, which would be in time for Coventry being the UK City of Culture.During early 2019, it was announced that development of the system had reached an advanced stage, along with an initial route and launch date. It is reportedly scheduled for the first demonstrator vehicle to be completed by autumn 2020, after which it will be subject to a series of tests in advance of its delivery during the following year. Testing will be conducted at the Very Light Rail National Innovation Centre in Castle Hill, Dudley, West Midlands. It has been speculated that early passenger-carrying services could commence as early as 2021 while a full service would follow two or three years later.\n\n\n== Technology ==\nThe concept of 'Very Light Rail' (VLR) has been developed as a means of delivering a light rail system at a much lower cost and with much reduced construction times than traditional tramways or light rail systems. This will allow for such systems to be rolled out across smaller towns and cities so they can gain benefits of a tram system at a considerably more affordable cost. The system had reportedly been engineered for compatibility with the existing West Midlands Metro mass transit network. The first demonstrator was shown however to be a high-floor vehicle in 2021. It has been envisioned that services upon the network could be operated upon a 'turn up and go' frequency at a typical interval of every three to four minutes, rather than using a timetable.The VLR concept uses lightweight vehicles, each typically accommodating 50 passengers; of these 20 will be seated while 30 will have to stand. It has been proposed for these vehicles to eventually be operated autonomously. Guidance is to be primarily achieved from its rails. The vehicle are primarily composed of steel and aluminium, while also incorporating several composite components. The vehicles are to be equipped with batteries; when combined with rapid charging systems, the need for overhead line equipment to be installed throughout the route is dispensed with, resulting in reduced installation costs. Being electrically powered, it produces zero emissions and is therefore an environment-friendly means of transportation.A major feature of the system is the track, which is prefabricated. This is relatively lightweight and shallower than traditional tramway track, enabling it to be laid over existing utilities and thus avoiding the need for these to be relocated, requiring less excavation; all of these factors make it quicker and cheaper to install. If required, the track can be dismantled and reused at other locations, being held together by a series of clips; this feature has also been promoted for ease of maintenance. The track is seated upon slabs, the materials of which can comprise a high-strength foam core with a recycled plastic coating.\n\n\n== Network and funding ==\nThe first proposed route for the system is from Coventry railway station to the University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire via Coventry city centre. This route is proposed to be operational by 2024. Another proposed route would link the railway station with the University of Warwick. In the long term, the city council has intentions to construct a total of four routes which are intended to connect the major residential, industrial and commercial areas across the city, as well as a direct connection to the HS2 station near Birmingham Airport via Kenpas Highway & (possibly) Allesley. Furthermore, it is hoped that the successful demonstration of the technology at Coventry will give developers and planners elsewhere confidence to deploy their own networks at other locations.The scheme has been included in a wider \u00a315 billion plan to reshape mass transit in the West Midlands. \u00a32.4 million of funding for its development has been sourced from the British Government's Local Growth fund through the Coventry and Warwickshire Local Enterprise Partnership (CWLEP). An additional \u00a312.2 million was secured from the devolution deal for the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA). Additional backing may come from private enterprises, efforts to secure such partnerships commenced during late 2019. It has been stated that the cost of building the system will equal \u00a37 million per kilometre, which is substantially less than the \u00a335-60 million per kilometre of traditional tram systems.\n\n\n== Stops ==\nAll stops listed are subject to change and are only proposed.\nLine 1: Coventry Railway Station, The Quadrant, Broadgate/High Street, Pool Meadow Bus Station, University Square, Fargo Village, Ball Hill, Longfellow Road, Barras Heath, Hipswell Highway, Wyken, Norton Hill Drive, Clifford Bridge Road, University Hospital Coventry.\nStations if line is extended:\nLine 1: Walsgrave, Brade Drive, Crosspoint Retail Park\n\n\n== Vehicles ==\nThe vehicle (Yet to be named) will carry up to 80 passengers in total with 56 seated, the first vehicle left the production line in March 2021, and was taken on a showcase tour before being taken to Dudley for testing. With the low capacity, the vehicles will operate at a frequency of every 5-6 minutes, with the Hourly Capacity being quadruple the capacity of the existing bus system in the city. There are plans to implement autonomous technology to bring frequencies up to every 3-4 minutes, this will most likely only occur if trams become overcrowded (which is expected).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCoventry Corporation Tramways - the historic tramway system in Coventry which ceased operation in 1940.\nLight rail\nWest Midlands Metro - another tramway system in the West Midlands.\nParry People Movers\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoventry City Council page about the system\nUniversity of Warwick page about the system\nVery Light Rail Innovation Centre",

    "Ngayap": "Before, in the Iban community, efforts to allure a boy to a virgin was done at night through a courting practice called Ngayap (English: \"wing\")This ngayap practice was undertaken to allow the boy and the girl to meet and express their hearts to their partners. Although the practice of ngayap was allowed, it should be done with adapted manners based on the customs and way of life of the Iban society itself to avoid any thought and slander that might contaminate the Iban culture.\nBy custom, the male can meet the girl not more than three nights in a row. If traffic continues, the parents of the girl have the right to determine and ask the boy if he is serious in his efforts to court or not. If it is found that the boy is not honest and just wants a spree then his visit should be stopped immediately. However, if the boy's intentions are serious and he intends to marry the girl, the boy would inform his parents of his intention to come to woo the girl. If the boy will continue nocturnal visits without deciding, then the girl's parents have the right to detain the boy and arrange the marriage in question and then refer the matter to Tuai Rumah (Sarawak longhouse chief) and the longhouse residents concerned.\nNowadays the tradition and practice of ngayap is no longer practiced in the modern mainstream of development and ways of life. Thus, meeting between boy and girl are run during gatherings, like festivals, and in schools, in institutions of higher learning, or in the workplace of their spouses. Ngayap is only a small part of the Iban cultural heritage. To prevent this culture of abuse by the new generation, this practice should be limited to the Iban. Only if there is a violation or interference of others in this practice, the law can be taken as cited in Section 132 of Adat Iban of 1993.\n\n\n== References ==",

His three sons, Pierre, Michel and Gilles were ennobled together by letters patent from king Henry III of France on 12 January 1587.In 1692, Gilles-Fran\u00e7ois de Maupeou inherited the town of Ableiges, which he developed and promoted to great success. In 1692, the hereditary title of Count of Ableiges was bestowed upon him by King Louis XIV of France.\nThe Maupeou family came to prominence with Ren\u00e9 Nicolas, Keeper of the Seals and last Lord Chancellor of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, under the reign of Louis XV of France. In 1771, Ren\u00e9 Nicolas de Maupeou, then Chancellor since 1768, exiled 130 members of the Parlement in what amounted to a coup d'\u00e9tat in order to take back the judiciary, thus restauring King Louis XV of France's authority over political reforms. At the time, the Dauphin, future Louis XVI of France, approved of the Chancellor's reforms despite a wave of hostility from the higher nobility and magistrates. Nonetheless, when Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, and was quick to dismiss Maupeou and the reforms he had implemented. In November of the same year, when the old parlements were called back, he is to have said: \u00ab If the king wants to lose his crown, he is master \u00bb.The Maupeou family has been granted the Honours of the Court in the 17th century.\n\n\n== Branches ==\nThe house of Maupeou is divided in four main genealogical branches, two remain today :\n\nthe Lords of Monceau, extinct,\nthe Lords of Bruy\u00e8res, remaining,\nthe Lords of Sablonni\u00e8res, extinct,\nand the Counts of Ableiges, remaining.\n\n\n== Notable members ==\n\nGilles de Maupeou (1553-1641), Controller-General of Finances.\nRen\u00e9 Charles de Maupeou (1689-1775), first president of the parlement of Paris.\nRen\u00e9 Nicolas de Maupeou (1714-1792), his son, keeper of the Seals and lord chancellor of France.\nJacques de Maupeou d'Ableiges (1899 - 1963), Senator of the French Republic\n\n\n== References ==",

Jones' section (sans Frazer, because he's \"meeting\" a client in Eastbourne) volunteer themselves as stewards. When they leave, Mainwaring praises his men, declaring them indispensable. Wilson asks if Mainwaring was harsh about the public house business, but Mainwaring does not think he was, and blames it on the way he was brought up: every member of his family knew when to stop.\nMeanwhile, on board a train carriage, a drunken figure with more than a passing resemblance to Mainwaring downs a hip flask of Scotch. The train stops at Eastbourne, and Frazer joins the man in the carriage, and quickly learns that the drunken man is Mainwaring's black sheep brother Barry, and that he is on his way to Walmington to collect a half-hunter watch that, he claims, Mainwaring stole from him after their father's demise. Frazer is more than happy to tell Mainwaring that his brother is in town.\nA few days later, Mainwaring tells Wilson that he is not ashamed of his brother, but he feels that he let his talents go to waste, while he became a respected and trustworthy figure who can look the world full in the face. Barry rings and Mainwaring declines the call, leaving it to Wilson. Mainwaring tells Wilson to tell Barry that he will meet him at the Red Lion inn.\nWhen he gets there, he confronts Barry about the watch. Barry claims that their father intended to give Barry the watch for looking after him. Mainwaring scoffs at his attempts to look after their father, and refuses to hand over the watch. Barry blackmails his brother by saying that he will show him up at the sherry party if he does not. Mainwaring reluctantly hands over the watch, getting Barry's solemn oath that he will be out of Walmington on the 9:30 train.\nThe party goes well until Barry unexpectedly arrives, wanting to apologise for his earlier behaviour, and gets into a lengthy chat with Chief Warden Hodges, the Vicar and the Verger. Pike drags him into the dressing room, giving him a bottle of sherry to himself, in exchange for keeping his mouth shut. Mainwaring arrives, and Hodges gleefully tells him that he had a chat with his brother. Mainwaring is shocked and asks Wilson, Frazer, Jones, Sponge and Pike to get him out as soon as possible.\nThey try shoving him through the window, but he is too fat, so they carry a comatose Barry out in an empty cupboard. Wilson admits to Mainwaring that he retrieved the watch for him, but Mainwaring's heart of gold allows him to give the watch back to Wilson, and tells Wilson to give it back to Barry and wish him well.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nThere is only one scene where both the Mainwaring brothers appear on screen at the same time. This is set in the bedroom at the Red Lion hotel where Barry is staying. Barry spends most of the scene sitting or lying on his bed whereas Captain Mainwaring stays close to the door. The camera angles during the scene are usually set so that only one of the brothers is seen at once, the other speaking out of vision, allowing Arthur Lowe to pre-record his dialogue for the unseen brother.\n\n\n== Cast ==\nArthur Lowe as Captain Mainwaring/Barry Mainwaring\nJohn Le Mesurier as Sergeant Wilson\nClive Dunn as Lance Corporal Jones\nJohn Laurie as Private Frazer\nArnold Ridley as Private Godfrey\nIan Lavender as Private Pike\nBill Pertwee as ARP Warden Hodges\nEdward Sinclair as The Verger\nFrank Williams as The Vicar\nPenny Irving as Chambermaid\nArnold Diamond as Major-General Anstruther-Stevens\nColin Bean as Private Sponge",
    "Ballyhoura Mountains": "The Ballyhoura Mountains (Irish: An Sliabh Riabhach) are located in south-east County Limerick and north-east County Cork in central Munster, running east and west for about 6 miles on the borders of both counties.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe southern part of the hills is largely afforested with conifers, on the northern side there is extensive heathland and blanket bog. The mountains include Seefin (528m, 1702 ft), near Seefin on the northwest is Black Rock (516m, 1696 ft) and 3 miles to the west is Carron Mountain (c.440m, 1469 ft) on the boundary of Cork and Limerick. Immediately east of Seefin is Knockea (1311 ft), east of which again is the detached mountain of Knockeennamroanta (1319 ft). Between these is the pass of Barnaderg, now called Redchair, leading from the plain of Limerick to the plain of Cork. At the north side of the valley is the peak of Barnageeha (1196 ft).The Ballyhoura Mountains have been listed as a Special Area of Conservation. The blanket bog occurs in most of the flatter areas and features such species as heather (Calluna vulgaris), with deergrass (Trichophorum cespitosum), hare\u2019s-tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum), common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). The wet heath is dominated by heather, cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix) and bilberry  accompanied by a range of mosses and liverworts. The dry heath is more species-rich, with bell heather (Erica cinerea), green-ribbed sedge (Carex binervis), tormentil (Potentilla erecta), bent grasses (Agrostis spp.) and mosses such as Hypnum jutlandicum.The Ballyhoura Mountain Bike Park situated near under Seefin and Blackrock is the largest Trail network of its kind in Ireland. The trails range from the moderate 6 kilometre Greenwood loop to the demanding 50 kilometre Castlepook loop. The nearest towns and villages to the Trailhead are Ardpatrick, Glenosheen, Ballyorgan and Kilfinnane.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of mountains in Ireland\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoillte Mountain Bike Trail\nBallyhoura Bears Walking Club",

    "Charles Judd (missionary)": "Charles Henry Judd (1842 \u2013 23 October 1919), was a British Protestant missionary to China with the China Inland Mission. He was among the first to bring news of the Gospel to Guizhou, Hunan, and Hebei during the late Qing Dynasty when travel was limited to walking or river boat journeys.\n\n\n== Missionary experiences ==\nCharles Henry Judd, was the son of Robert Judd and (Mrs.) Jane Judd. He was born prior to 26 July  1842.\nJudds first occupation was as a bank clerk in Loughborough. He later enrolled at the Church Missionary Society College, Islington, London, in preparation to joining the Church Missionary Society. His convictions regarding believer baptism (as opposed to infant baptism) changed his plans, however. Judd attended meetings at Welbeck Street and was acquainted with the CMS missionary Frederick Foster Gough. After the Lammermuir Party had sailed for China, Judd became aware of the writings of Henry Grattan Guinness, and met Thomas John Barnardo at Gough's home in Bow, East End of London. As a result, he became interested in James Hudson Taylor's mission and his book \"China's Spiritual Need and Claims\". Soon Judd ceased attending the CMS training institute. For several months he lived with William Thomas Berger at Saint Hill Manor, near East Grinstead, Sussex, serving as a tutor in English .\nJudd married Elizabeth Jane Broumton in October 1867. The newly married couple left for China with Mrs. Ann Bohannan, John Edwin Cardwell and wife, and Edward Fishe. The party arrived in China on 3 March 1868.\nIn 1868 Judd was assigned to Yangzhou, Jiangsu. It was here that the couple saw what hardships possibly awaited them in China, arriving not long after the Yangzhou riot had nearly claimed the lives of Taylor and his family and fellow missionaries.\n\nIn 1869 the Judds were stationed at Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. They returned to England on furlough in 1872 and came again to China in 1873. In 1874 Judd was at Wuchang, Hubei, with J. Hudson Taylor opening a mission station. In 1875, with Adam C. Dorward and two Chinese going into the \u201cunreached\u201d interior of China for the first time for any missionary in Hunan, they rented a house at Yuezhou (now Yueyang), but were forced out by local Chinese.\nIn 1877 Judd and his brother-in-law James F. Broumton traveled through Hunan province to become the first Protestant Christian missionaries in Guiyang, Guizhou. Broumton later pioneered work among the Miao and Yi people minority groups. Only the British explorer William Mesny had attempted the introduction of Christianity earlier in Guizhou. While Broumton remained at Guiyang, Judd returned to Wuchang via Chongqing, Sichuan.\nIn 1879 Judd was doing missionary work at Yantai [or Chefoo], Shandong, before the CIM \u201cChefoo School\u201d and sanatorium were established there.\nAdam Dorward and Judd traveled on an evangelistic journey 1500 miles across China from 1880-1882.\nJudd left China again between 1885 and May 1887. He returned, then left again in May 1894.\nJudd died in London, England, on 23 October 1919. Elizabeth Judd died in 1926.\nThey had several children: George H. Judd, Edwin Judd, Frederick Hudson Judd, Charles H.

    "1919\u201320 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team": "The 1919\u201320 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University during the 1919\u201320 NCAA college basketball season. John O'Reilly coached the team in his sixth season as head coach. Georgetown was an independent and played its home games at Ryan Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus in Washington, D.C. and finished the season with a record of 13-1.\n\n\n== Season recap ==\n\nOn-campus Ryan Gymnasium, where the Hoyas had played their home games since the 1914-15 season, had no seating, accommodating fans on a standing-room only-basis on an indoor track above the court. This precluded the accommodation of significant crowds, providing the self-sustaining Basketball Association with little revenue with which to fund the team's travel expenses and averaged no more than three road games a year from the 1918-19 season through the 1926-27 season in order to keep travel to a minimum. The 1919-20 team's only road trip outside of Washington was to New York City and Connecticut at the end of the season.\nThe 1918\u20131919 season had taken place between the second and third waves of the 1918\u20131919 influenza pandemic \u2014 the so-called \"Spanish flu\" \u2014 and had been shortened to only 10 games. That team had finished with a record of 9\u20131, and because of the pandemic its players were granted an extra year of college eligibility. As a result, all five starters from the 1918\u20131919 team returned for the 1919\u20131920 season, setting the stage for even greater success during the year.The Hoyas' home winning streak at Ryan Gymnasium reached 25 games at the end of this season, dating back to a victory against Bucknell on the last day of the 1916-17 season; it would reach 52 before finally coming to an end during the 1923-24 season. A highlight of the home season at Ryan was the Hoyas' upset of North Carolina, considered one of the top teams in the United States at the time. Georgetown also defeated crosstown rival George Washington twice again this season, giving the Hoyas a 12-game winning streak against George Washington \u2013 ten of the wins at Ryan Gymnasium \u2013 dating back to 1915.Georgetown University Law School student Fred Fees, a forward, completed his college basketball career this season. A free-throw shooting specialist in an era when the rules of college basketball allowed teams to choose which player shot its free throws, Fees had exploited his free-throw prowess to establish himself as one of the top scorers in college basketball in the United States in each of his four seasons with the Hoyas. This season he averaged 17.7 points per game and scored a total of 245 points, a career high and half of all the points the team scored. He made 61 field goals this season and shot 123-for-140 (87.9%) from the free-throw line, a free-throw-shooting percentage that remained a school record until 1978. Fees completed his collegiate career with a career average of 16.8 points scored per game, a remarkable record, and had no peer in college basketball of the era; through at least the 2012-13 season it remains the fourth-highest career average in Georgetown men's basketball history. He scored 804 points in the 48 collegiate games he played for Georgetown, and led the team in scoring in 45 of them. During his four years with the Hoyas he scored 45 percent of their points.Sophomore forward Jack Flavin became a starter this year and, in fact, started all 14 games. An excellent shooter, he averaged 4.7 points per gane, and scored a total of 66 points.Sophomore guard Andrew \"Andy\" Zazzali played in all 14 games, and continued the strong scoring he had displayed the previous season. He averaged 7.0 points per game and scored a total of 98 points.The team opened the season with an 11-game winning streak, finally losing at Yale. It then closed the season with two wins to finish at 13-1. It tied the 1910-11 team for what was then the largest number of wins in school history, and its .929 winning percentage remains the best in Georgetown men's basketball history. In 1995, the Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively ranked the team sixth in the United States for the 1919\u201320 season.\n\n\n== Roster ==\nSourcesGeorgetown players did not wear numbers on their jerseys this season. The first numbered jerseys in Georgetown men's basketball history would not appear until the 1933-34 season.Junior forward and team captain Bill Dudack later served as the Hoyas' head coach during the 1929-30 season.\n\n\n== 1919\u201320 schedule and results ==\nSourcesNoteIt was common practice at this time for colleges and universities to include non-collegiate opponents in their schedules, with the games recognized as part of their official record for the season, so the game against a United States Army team from Camp Humphrey, Virginia, counted as part of Georgetown's won-loss record for 1919-20. It was not until 1952, after the completion of the 1951-52 season, that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) ruled that colleges and universities could no longer count games played against non-collegiate opponents in their annual won-loss records.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "C. M. Poonacha": "Cheppudira Muthana Poonacha was the Chief Minister of Coorg, Minister in Mysore State, Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha), Union Railway Minister of India and Governor of Madhya Pradesh and Governor of Orissa.\n\n\n== Freedom Movement ==\nC. M. Poonacha was a descendant of the Coorg Dewans. During the Freedom Movement he was sentenced to imprisonment twice during the Salt Satyagraha in 1932 and 1933. He was again imprisoned in 1940\u201341. and in 1942\u201344. He became a member of All-India Congress Committee in 1938. Also, in 1938 he was elected to Coorg District Board, became its President in 1941 and in 1945 he was elected to Coorg Legislative Council. From 1945 to 1951 he was leader of the Congress Legislative Party in the Council. He hence became a prominent member of the Indian National Congress party in Coorg.\n\n\n== Politics ==\nIn 1947 Coorg was a separate state in South India until 1956. The other states of South India at that time were Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency, Mysore kingdom, Travancore kingdom, Cochin kingdom and Hyderabad kingdom. The Coorg State Assembly had a strength of 24 members and the Cabinet consisted of just two members.\n\n\n=== Constituent Assembly Member (Constitution of India) ===\nC M Poonacha represented the Coorg state as a member of the Constituent Assembly.\n\n\n=== Chief Minister (Coorg) ===\nTwo parties fought the 1952 state elections: the Takkadi ('Scales of Justice') party under veteran Gandhian Pandyanda Belliappa, who was a dominant political force and voice of Coorg with its anti-merger plank, and the Congress under C.M. Poonacha in Coorg. Poonacha was elected Chief Minister of Coorg State (1952\u201356) in the first general elections. Coorg had two MPs in the Union Parliament then, besides having a state legislative body. In 1956 the State Reorganisation Act was passed. Coorg was merged with Mysore and the legislative body at Mercara dissolved. While the Chief Minister was C.M. Poonacha, (who also held the finance portfolio), the only other Minister was Home Minister, Kittur Mallappa. C.M. Poonacha had won the Beriathnad seat while K. Mallappa won the second seat from Sanivarasante. The Congress won 15 seats and Independents (opposing merger), represented by the Takkadi party, won nine seats. Under various circumstances Coorg was merged with the then Mysore in 1956. This election was widely controversial as it was believed that many people from nearby districts of Hunsur, Mysore and Mandya were brought to Kodagu to vote as the government of Karnataka (Congress) believed people of Kodagu will vote overwhelmingly in opposition of the merger.\n\n\n=== State Minister (Mysore) ===\nAfter the formation of the new Mysore State Poonacha was Minister for Home and Industries under its Chief Minister S. Nijalingappa. He was also Chairman, State Trading Corporation of India from 1959 to 1963. He led the Government of India Trade delegation to some East European countries in 1960 and was the leader of the State Trading Corporation delegation to Japan in 1961.\n\n\n=== Central Minister ===\nPoonacha was elected to the Rajya Sabha in April 1964. Later Poonacha was made Union Minister without portfolio in Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet. From 1 to 24 January 1966, he was Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance and from 25 January 1966 to 12 March 1967 Minister of State in the Ministry of Transport, Aviation, Shipping and Tourism. He contested and won the Lok Sabha seat for the Mangalore constituency in 1969. He contested again in 1971 as a candidate of NCO party, but lost.\n\n\n=== Union Railway Minister ===\nAfter some time he became Union Minister for Railways from 1967 to 1969 (at first interim and then final) and Minister for Steel and Heavy Engineering in 1969. At that time he was the Member of Parliament representing Mangalore Lok Sabha constituency to which Coorg then belonged.\n\n\n== Retirement ==\n\n\n=== Governor ===\nAfter his retirement from active politics, he served two terms as governor, once as Governors of Madhya Pradesh taking charge on 17 August 1978 and later as Governor of Orissa on 30 April 1980.\n\n\n== Family ==\nPoonacha had two sons and two daughters.

    "Savion Castro": "Savion Castro (born 1994) is an officer and member of Board of Education of the Madison Metropolitan School District, and is the youngest member to ever serve on the board.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nCastro grew up in Madison, Wisconsin, and attended public schools and graduated from La Follette High School and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In his early years, he struggled with a learning disability and his family struggled with homelessness, issues which often led to truancy and academic problems. In 6th grade he was selected to participate in a program, with support from Best Buy and the University of Wisconsin, designed to provide a pathway to college. In 2010 he met President Barack Obama during a stop in Madison. Four years later, in 2014, as a sophomore in college, Castro was singled out in a speech by First Lady Michelle Obama for his determination to succeed despite setbacks and hardship. A few months later he wrote about prison reform, offering Madison as an example, noting that \"even the most 'progressive' of places are not immune from a criminal-justice system that is archaic, ineffective, and most of all, unjust.\"\n\n\n== First, Second amendment challenges ==\nIn 2017, Castro, a college senior at the time, made headlines for his outspoken opposition to efforts, driven both by the University of Wisconsin board of regents and several state lawmakers, that sought to punish students who protest or disrupt others' speech. In May, he testified to a capitol panel that legislation being proposed was unjust, saying, \"We have the right to assert our humanity when it is questioned.\" During a news conference, Castro accused school leaders of \"capitulating to a bunch of right-wing extremists.\" He said that such restrictions unfairly affect minority students. In an op-ed, Castro wrote, \"Most African American students never forget their first time walking into a lecture hall filled with hundreds of students and being the only black face. It is a chilling and isolating feeling. The voices of people of color on campus are often discouraged, overlooked, and silenced.\" The bill, which passed later that year, followed a 2016 incident in which conservative columnist Ben Shapiro was shouted down during a campus visit.In May 2019, Castro found himself at the center of news story that drew national attention over a handgun incident in the state capitol. While working as an aide to Shelia Stubbs, a Democratic state lawmaker, Castro was confronted by a Republican lawmaker who displayed a handgun in Stubbs' office. Castro asked the assemblyman, Shae Sortwell, to leave the office. Sortwell complied, but the confrontation ignited a debate about second amendment rights.\n\n\n== School board career ==\nCastro was appointed in July 2019 to replace Mary Burke, a former executive of Trek bicycles, becoming the youngest member ever to serve on the Madison School Board. His appointment also meant that for the first time there were two African Americans sitting on the seven-member board. He told a local reporter that he would seek to build trust \"with young parents of color who are moving here who hear that Madison is one of the worst places to raise a black family, that we have a commitment (and) that we are working on it.\u201dLater that year, Castro drew national attention when he spoke out about an incident at West High School, where a security guard had been terminated for using prohibited language, a situation Castro called \"incredibly frustrating.\"In April 2020, he was formally elected to the seat, and currently serves as treasurer to the board.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMMSD Board of Education website",

After initial success, technical difficulties and a flagging number of users led to her decommissioning. She was then sold to a French company in 1972.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the early 1960, the imminence of Expo 64 led to a number of engineering projects being started in the vicinity of Lausanne. In the contexte, the Compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de navigation sur le lac L\u00e9man (CGN), which operates both historical steam paddle ships and modern liners on the Lake of Geneva, was studying the commissioning of a modern unit. On 10 May 1962, its extraordinary assembly of shareholders decided on ordering a hydrofoil. The chosen design was by Leopoldo Rodriquez, from Messina, for a 1.2 million CHF budget.Albatros was built during the year 1963. On 8 February 1964, she departed Messina for her maiden journey to Marseille, thus becoming the first CGN ship sailing the open sea. \u00b7 . Upon arriving in Marseille, she was lifted on a truck and brought to Lausanne by road.On 16 April, Albatros was put in service as a shuttle on the Vidy-\u00c9vian line. Her draft would prevent from entering the roads of Gevena in most conditions. In 1970, due to a diminishing public, CGN decided to sell Albatros.In 1972, Albatros was sold to a company of Lavandou.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nJacques Christinat, Bateaux du L\u00e9man, deux si\u00e8cles de Navigation, collection Archives vivantes, \u00c9ditions Cab\u00e9dita, Yens-sur-Morges, 1991, ISBN 2-88295-061-6, pp. 196\u2013197\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Bellerive, 1971\".

Still under the command of Charles Dumouriez, he fought at the Battle of Jemappes in November 1792. Later that year, he led Dumouriez's advance guard in successful actions at Mechelen (Malines) and Voroux-les-Liers in the Austrian Netherlands. In March 1793, he was defeated at Aldenhoven and driven out of Aachen by the Allies. For this he was arrested and tried before a Revolutionary Tribunal. He was acquitted but retired from military service.Restored to favor, Stengel was reappointed general of brigade on 1 March 1795. Promoted to general of division on 13 June, he was transferred to command the cavalry of the Army of Italy.

    "BW Vulpeculae": "BW Vulpeculae or BW Vul, is a variable star in the northern constellation of Vulpecula. It is near the lower limit of visibility to the naked eye with a typical apparent visual magnitude of 6.54. Based on an annual parallax shift of 1.15 mas, the distance to BW Vul is about 2,800 light years. It is moving closer to the Earth with a baseline heliocentric radial velocity of around \u22126 km/s.This is a B-type giant star with a stellar classification of B2 IIIv, where the 'v' suffix indicates variability in spectral features. Various authors have printed mass estimates ranging from 11 to 14 times the mass of the Sun, although Tetzlaff et al. (2011) gives a mass of just 6.8 M\u2609. It is about 3.4 million years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 24 km/s. The star is typically radiating 515 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 23,014 K.The variability of this star was announced in 1937, at the 58th Meeting of the American Astronomical Society by Canadian astronomer, Robert Methven Petrie. It is a Beta Cephei variable that ranges between magnitudes 6.44 and 6.68 over a period of 4.8 hours. For unknown reasons, the periodicity of the star has undergone sudden changes, followed by long periods of stability. BW Vul is one of the most extreme \u03b2 Cephei stars in terms of variability of light and radial velocity. This is hypothesized as being due to the star's relatively high metallicity, meaning the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. A distinctive feature of its radial velocity cycle is a unique \"standstill\" feature, which is caused by a shockwave generated by infall of material from a previous cycle.\n\n\n== References ==",

As a young man, he left school to work in an accountant's office, working there for a year when he decided to pursue a career in the arts. He studied in the Central School of Arts and Crafts having won a scholarship, and went on to study stained glass under Christopher Whall as an assistant glass painter and designer. Child was married to Annie, with whom he had two sons and a daughter. Child died of stroke in Dublin in 1939.\n\n\n== Artistic work ==\nChild was invited to Dublin in September 1901 to teach in the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, forming a class in stained glass within two months. Whilst working in the School he tutored a generation of Irish stained-glass artists which included Harry Clarke, Ethel Rhind, Catherine O\u2019Brien, Michael Healy and Evie Hone. It is this influence is seen as his largest contribution to Irish stained glass art.Child became the manager of An T\u00far Gloine upon its opening in 1903.

    "Henry Burchard Fine": "Henry Burchard Fine (September 14, 1858 \u2013 December 22, 1928) was an American university dean and mathematician.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nHenry Burchard Fine (1858 \u2013 1928) played a critical role in modernizing the American university and raising American mathematics \u201cfrom a state of approximate nullity to one verging on parity with the European nations\u201d.  This tribute in Oswald Veblen\u2019s obituary [see in \"Obituary\" below] accurately recognized Fine\u2019s role both in training American mathematicians to provide international leadership to this field and in building Princeton University\u2019s reputation in mathematics and science.  Fine\u2019s efforts contributed greatly toward making Princeton the site of Albert Einstein\u2019s first North American lectures, and eventually his home.\nFine began his time as a Princeton undergraduate studying Greek and Latin, but a mathematics tutor, George B. Halstead, convinced him to switch his considerable talents to mathematics.  He ranked highest academically in his Class of 1880 for all four years, during which he caught the attention of President James McCosh. As a result, Fine was among a small group of highly talented undergraduates whom McCosh invited to his house for informal seminars and nurtured as future faculty.\nAfter graduation, Fine remained at Princeton (then called the College of New Jersey) for a year of post-graduate work followed by three more years as a tutor.  Then, as Germany was the leading center of mathematics scholarship, he went to the University of Leipzig to study mathematics with Felix Klein under whom he earned his PhD in one year.\nHe returned to Princeton as an Assistant Professor of Mathematics in 1885 and soon established himself as a leader in the faculty, ultimately named the Dod Professor of Mathematics in 1898.  In addition, his reputation beyond Princeton grew through publications and his role as one of the founding members of the American Mathematical Society.  However, it was reviving his undergraduate friendship with Woodrow Wilson (Class of 1879) that led to his subsequent impact on Princeton and American scholarship.  Fine, (Class of 1880), one year behind Wilson, assisted him as a junior and then succeeded him as Managing Editor of the \"Princetonian\", the campus\u2019 student newspaper.  When Wilson joined the Princeton faculty in 1890 their\nrelationship resumed, beginning a close and consequential lifelong friendship.\nAfter McCosh\u2019s retirement in 1888, the College of New Jersey\u2019s new President, Francis Landey Patton, was satisfied to preside over what he called \"the best country club\" in the country.  However, the young faculty whom McCosh had nurtured, including Fine, and their allies on the Board of Trustees grew restive and pushed him out in favor of Wilson in 1902.\nWilson quickly chose Fine to be his right-hand man as the Dean of the College.  They set about transforming Princeton by raising academic standards, revising the curriculum, and replacing several senior faculty members.  Wilson also convinced the Trustees to hire 50 new young faculty members he called \u2018preceptors\u2019.  The addition of this large number of young, enthusiastic junior faculty had a significant impact on the quality, focus and seriousness of Princeton at both the undergraduate and graduate school levels.\nBecause Wilson lacked interest in science and mathematics, he delegated the preceptor appointments to Fine, giving him the opportunity to transform Princeton\u2019s programs in those fields.  Fine had an extraordinary ability to identify talented individuals in these fields and a commitment to promoting their careers.  His initial preceptorial appointments all went on to become respected mathematicians and when some vacancies developed, he replaced them with similar young talent.  He also recruited established American and European mathematicians.  By 1911, Princeton\u2019s Department of Mathematics ranked as one of the top three in America and had become the home of the prestigious Annals of Mathematics.\nIn addition, Fine jump-started Princeton\u2019s weak science departments by recruiting some leading scientists, including mathematical physicist James Jeans [1], physicist Owen Wilnans Richardson Owen Willans Richardson, and biologist Edwin Grant Conklin Edwin Conklin.  Fine also nurtured younger scientists such as astronomer Henry Norris Russell.\nFine\u2019s time was increasingly focused on administration and the controversies that eventually dragged down the Wilson presidency.  He and Wilson won one battle, gaining control of the Graduate School from Wilson\u2019s archenemy, Andrew Fleming West.  While ceremonial leadership remained with West, Fine became the dominant force in turning Princeton into a modern research university.\nHowever, Wilson lost his attempt to reduce the influence of Princeton\u2019s undergraduate \u2018eating clubs\u2019 and to have the Graduate College constructed in the middle of campus. When Wilson left to enter politics, Fine became acting president in all but name, while also serving as President of the American Mathematical Society.  Although Fine had loyally supported Wilson\u2019s losing proposals and was a leading candidate to become president, he then loyally supported President John Grier Hibben for the rest of his career.\nWith Hibben\u2019s ascendance, Fine became in reality what he had long been, Dean of the Departments of Science, a position he held until his death 1928.  He remained deeply loyal Princeton, turning down offers of the presidency of M.I.T. and Johns Hopkins University as well as Wilson\u2019s offers to name him Ambassador to Germany and to the Federal Reserve Board.\nFine continued teaching, publishing leading textbooks and occasional articles, and building his departments.  The Department of Mathematics\u2019 prestige led, in 1921, to it hosting Albert Einstein\u2019s first American lectures.  In the 1920s, Fine was particularly successful in raising money from the General Education Board and Rockefeller Foundation to support Princeton\u2019s growing science programs.  As a consequence, in the 1920s only the University of Chicago attracted more National Research Council Fellowships and no Princeton application was rejected. Roger Geiger, To Advance Knowledge, (1986), 200-203]\nIn addition to his duties as Dean of Science, Fine served on numerous campus committees, especially chairing the Board of Athletic Control. In the community he served on and chaired the Board of Education for many years.\nHis final gift to Princeton and mathematics was a consequence of his tragic death.  His sister had founded Miss Fine\u2019s School and his brother founded Princeton Preparatory School.  Bicycling to visit the latter on a dark December evening in 1928 he was struck and killed by a car.  In response, his close friend and wealthy Princeton Trustee, Thomas D. Jones, funded construction of Fine Hall, arguably the finest mathematics building in the country.  Jones' response to cost overruns was \"nothing is too good for Harry Fine.\" [Princeton Alumni Weekly, Oct. 30, 1931]  Finished in 1931, Fine Hall also served as the first home of the new Institute of Advanced Study [2], and of its most distinguished faculty member, Albert Einstein, until its separate building was completed in 1939.  The other founding faculty member, and the person who convinced the funders to situate the IAS in Princeton, was Oswald Veblen, one of Fine\u2019s original preceptors.\nAlthough he spent his entire career at one institution, Fine\u2019s career is an important chapter in the emergence of the American university.  Whereas he had been drawn to Germany for his PhD in the 1880s, shortly after his death, Princeton University and the Institute of Advanced Study surpassed G\u00f6ttingen as the world\u2019s center of mathematical physics.  And he had played a major role in that transformation.\nHenry Fine was one of the founders of the American Mathematical Society and served as its President in 1911\u20131912.

    "MA": "M, or m, is the thirteenth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Its name in English is em (pronounced ), plural ems.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe letter M is derived from the Phoenician Mem, via the Greek Mu (\u039c, \u03bc). Semitic Mem is most likely derived from a \"Proto-Sinaitic\"  (Bronze Age) adoption of the  \"water\" ideogram in Egyptian writing. The Egyptian sign had the acrophonic value /n/, from the Egyptian word for \"water\", nt; the adoption as the Semitic letter for /m/ was presumably also on acrophonic grounds, from the Semitic word for \"water\", *m\u0101(y)-.\n\n\n== Use in writing systems ==\nThe letter \u27e8m\u27e9 represents the bilabial nasal consonant sound [m] in the orthography of Latin as well as in that of many modern languages, and also in the International Phonetic Alphabet. In English, the Oxford English Dictionary (first edition) says that \u27e8m\u27e9 is sometimes a vowel, in words like spasm and in the suffix -ism. In modern terminology, this is described as a syllabic consonant (IPA [m\u0329]).\nIn Washo, lower-case \u27e8m\u27e9 represents a typical em sound, while upper-case \u27e8M\u27e9 represents a voiceless em sound.\n\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nThe Roman numeral M represents the number 1000, though it was not used in Roman times. There is, however, scant evidence that the letter was later introduced in the early centuries A.D. by the Romans.\nUnit prefix M (mega), meaning one million times, and m (milli) meaning one-thousandth.\nm is the standard abbreviation for metre (or meter) in the International System of Units (SI). However, m is also used as an abbreviation for mile.\nM is used as the unit abbreviation for molarity.\nWith money amounts, m means one million: For example, $5m is five million dollars.\nM often represents male or masculine, especially in conjunction with F for female or feminine.\nM (James Bond) is a fictional character in Ian Fleming's James Bond book and film series.\nIn typography, an em dash is a punctuation symbol whose width is equal to that of a capital letter M.\n\n\n== Related characters ==\n\n\n=== Descendants and related characters in the Latin alphabet ===\nM with diacritics: \u1e3e \u1e3f \u1e40 \u1e41 \u1e42 \u1e43 M\u0303 m\u0303 \u1d6f\nIPA-specific symbols related to M: \u0271 \u0270\n\u2c6e : Capital M with hook\nUralic Phonetic Alphabet-specific symbols related to M:U+1D0D \u1d0d LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL M\nU+1D1F \u1d1f LATIN SMALL LETTER SIDEWAYS TURNED M\nU+1D39 \u1d39 MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL M\nU+1D50 \u1d50 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL M\nU+1D5A \u1d5a MODIFIER LETTER SMALL TURNED M\nSome symbols related to M were used by the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet prior to its formal standardization in 1902:U+2098 \u2098 LATIN SUBSCRIPT SMALL LETTER M\nU+A7FA \ua7fa LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL TURNED M\nThe Teuthonista phonetic transcription system uses U+AB3A \uab3a LATIN SMALL LETTER M WITH CROSSED-TAIL\nOther variations used for phonetic transcription: \u1d86 \u1dac \u1dad\n\u019c \u026f : Turned M\n\ua7fd : Inverted M was used in ancient Roman texts to stand for mulier (woman)\n\ua7ff : Archaic M was used in ancient Roman texts to abbreviate the personal name 'Manius' (A regular capital M was used for the more common personal name 'Marcus')\n\u2133 : currency symbol for Mark\n\n\n=== Ancestors and siblings in other alphabets ===\n\ud802\udd0c : Semitic letter Mem, from which the following symbols originally derive\n\u039c \u03bc : Greek letter Mu, from which M derives\n\u2c98 \u2c99 : Coptic letter Me, which derives from Greek Mu\n\u041c \u043c : Cyrillic letter Em, also derived from Mu\n\ud800\udf0c : Old Italic M, which derives from Greek Mu, and is the ancestor of modern Latin M\n\u16d7 : Runic letter Mannaz, which derives from old Italic M\n\ud800\udf3c : Gothic letter manna, which derives from Greek Mu\n\n\n=== Ligatures and abbreviations ===\n\u20a5 : Mill (currency)\n\u2122 : Trademark symbol\n\u2120 : Service mark symbol\n\n\n== Computing codes ==\n1 Also for encodings based on ASCII, including the DOS, Windows, ISO-8859 and Macintosh families of encodings.\n\n\n== Other representations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to M at Wikimedia Commons\n The dictionary definition of M at Wiktionary\n The dictionary definition of m at Wiktionary",
    "Gumbo!": "Gumbo (Louisiana Creole: Gombo) is a stew popular in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and is the official state cuisine. Gumbo consists primarily of a strongly-flavored stock, meat or shellfish, a thickener, and the Creole \"holy trinity\" \u2015 celery, bell peppers, and onions. Gumbo is often categorized by the type of thickener used, whether okra or fil\u00e9 powder (dried and ground sassafras leaves).\nGumbo can be made with or without okra or fil\u00e9 powder. The preferred method in the historical New Orleans variation is with a French dark roux. The flavor of the dish has its origins in many cultures.  Creole gumbo generally contains shellfish, and a dark roux, fil\u00e9, or both. Tomatoes are traditionally found in Creole gumbo and frequently appear in New Orleans cuisine but there is a \"camp\" of gumbo cooks who believe that tomatoes should not be used with okra. Cajun gumbo is generally based on a dark roux and is made with shellfish or fowl. Sausage or ham is often added to gumbos of either variety. After the base is prepared, vegetables are cooked down, and then meat is added. The dish simmers for a minimum of three hours, with shellfish and some spices added near the end. If desired, fil\u00e9 powder is added after the pot is removed from heat. Gumbo is traditionally served with rice. A third, lesser-known variety, the meatless gumbo z'herbes, is essentially a gumbo of slow-cooked greens.\nThe dish combines ingredients and culinary practices of several cultures, including African, French, Spanish, and Native American Choctaw. Gumbo may have been based on traditional native dishes, or may be a derivation of the French dish bouillabaisse, or Choctaw stew, but most likely all of these dishes contributed to the original recipe. It was first described in 1802, and was listed in various cookbooks in the latter half of the 19th century. The dish gained more widespread popularity in the 1970s, after the United States Senate dining room added it to the menu in honor of Louisiana Senator Allen Ellender. The popularity of chef Paul Prudhomme in the 1980s spurred further interest in the dish.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name of the dish comes most likely from Africa by way of Louisiana French. Scholars and chefs have offered various explanations for the etymology of the word \"gumbo\". The dish was likely named after one of its two main ingredients, okra or fil\u00e9. In the Niger\u2013Congo languages spoken by many enslaved  people from West Africa, the vegetable okra was known as ki ngombo or quingombo; the word is akin to the Umbundu ochingg\u00f4mbo and the Tshiluba chingg\u00f4mb\u00f4 \"okra\". In the language of the native Choctaw people, fil\u00e9, or ground sassafras leaves, is called kombo.\n\n\n== Variations ==\n\nGumbo is a heavily seasoned stew that combines several varieties of meat or seafood with a sauce or gravy. Any combination of meat or seafood can be used.  Meat-based gumbo may consist of chicken, duck, squirrel, or rabbit, with oysters occasionally added. Seafood-based gumbo generally has shrimp, crab meat, and sometimes oysters.  Andouille sausage is often added to both meat and seafood gumbos to provide \"piquancy, substance, and an additional layer of flavor\" to the dish. The key is to use a tender andouille so it does not become too chewy.  Most varieties of gumbo are seasoned with onions, parsley, bell pepper, and celery.  Tomatoes are sometimes used in seafood gumbo, but traditionally few other vegetables are included.\n\n\n=== Thickeners ===\n\nGumbo broth or gravy derives from three primary thickeners: okra, fil\u00e9 powder, and roux.  Traditionally, okra and fil\u00e9 powder are not used in the same dish, although this rule is sometimes broken.  Roux can be used alone or in conjunction with either of the other thickeners. Okra is more often used as a thickener in seafood gumbos than those with meat.  This mucilaginous vegetable is usually cooked first, and other ingredients added once the desired consistency is reached. According to The Oxford Companion to Food, okra-based gumbos are becoming less popular, as the okra texture has become less palatable to changing tastes.Ground sassafras leaf, known as fil\u00e9, is generally not added to the gravy until after the vegetables and meats or seafood have finished cooking and have been removed from the heat source.  If added during the boiling process, fil\u00e9 makes the gumbo too ropey; when added at the end, the gumbo gains a slightly stringy texture.Roux has become the most popular thickener, made from cooking together a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains.  A very dark roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.\n\n\n=== Cajun vs. Creole gumbo ===\n\nGumbo is typically divided into two varieties. Combinations traditionally common in New Orleans and southeastern Louisiana are known as \"Creole\" after the Louisiana Creole people, descendants of the area's French, Spanish, and African immigrants. \"Cajun\" combinations were common in southwestern Louisiana, which was populated primarily by Cajuns, descendants of the French-speaking settlers expelled from Acadia (located within the modern-day Canadian provinces of Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island) in the mid-18th century.Gumbo is usually identified by its dark roux, cooked until it is a color \"a few shades from burning\". The roux is used with okra or fil\u00e9 powder.  Seafood is popular in gumbo the closer to the water the people are, but the southwestern areas of Louisiana often use fowl, such as chicken or duck, and sausage.  The fowl is generally not deboned, and onions, celery, and bell pepper are not strained out of the dish.  Cajun gumbo is usually topped with parsley and green onions.Creole gumbo most often consists of seafood, tomatoes, and a thickener.  Before the latter half of the 20th century, celery was rarely used in Creole gumbo.\n\n\n=== Gumbo z'herbes ===\n\nWhen Catholics were expected to abstain from eating meat during Lent, a meatless variety of gumbo, known as gumbo z'herbes (from gumbo aux herbes, or \"gumbo of greens\"), was often served. This variety combined varied greens \u2013 typically including turnips, mustard greens, and spinach.  The greens were cooked to mush and strained through a sieve to produce a thick green liquid.  Preparation for this variety of gumbo was time-consuming, and as Lenten restrictions have relaxed, the dish has become less popular.  It is very rarely served in restaurants.  In modern times, ham or crabmeat is occasionally added to this type of gumbo.Gumbo z'herbes may have originated with the French/Spanish/West Africans. It has similarities to the French dish potage aux herbes (\"soup with greens\"), as well as to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nGumbo is often used as a metaphor for the mix of cultures that exist in southern Louisiana.  The dish combines the culinary practices of Africans, Native Americans, French, and Spanish. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people from these cultures lived within a fairly small area with minimal mobility. In this environment, cultures could influence each other and meld to create new traditions and cuisine.\n\nThe establishment of New Orleans in 1718 marked the beginning of the French colony of Louisiana. French settlers allied with various native tribes including the Choctaw, Alabama, and Cherokee, from whom they learned new methods of cooking and ways to identify edible indigenous plants.Slave ships began arriving in Louisiana in 1719.  The first ships carried rice and men who were experienced in its cultivation.  The grain adapted well to its new environment, and within a few years, rice was commonly grown along the Mississippi River.In 1721, 125 Germans settled 40 miles (64 km) from New Orleans, and introduced the art of making sausage. By 1746, the white population of Louisiana was estimated to be 3,200, with an estimated 4,730 black people. Enslaved Africans outnumbered whites in most areas of Louisiana for at least the next 40 years.The colony was transferred from French to Spanish control in 1762. The Spanish government actively recruited settlers for Spanish Louisiana. About 2,000 people from the Canary Islands moved to the area south of New Orleans.  These settlers were primarily fishermen who soon began supplying large amounts of shrimp, crab, and oysters to the food markets in New Orleans. The Canary Islanders also brought \"a love for well-seasoned food\", including use of ground cayenne pepper, a spicy hot red chili pepper. Spanish authorities also granted permission for many French-speaking Acadian exiles to relocate from northeastern North America to Louisiana. From 1755 through 1795, almost 3,000 of these settlers, soon known as Cajuns, moved to the areas south and west of New Orleans. Louisiana was secretly returned to France in 1800, then purchased by the United States in 1803. The southernmost part of territorial Louisiana, including New Orleans, became the state of Louisiana in 1812.\nBy 1800, the slave trade had introduced new foods to Louisiana, including the African vegetable okra, and hot pepper plants which likely came from Haiti. Onions and bell peppers were long part of cooking in both the Spanish and African traditions. Tomatoes were introduced to the region shortly thereafter.\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nScholars agree that gumbo originated in Louisiana in the early 18th century, but its uncertain etymology makes it difficult to pinpoint the origins of the food. Although no conclusive evidence exists, cultural markers indicate several plausible scenarios.As aforementioned, while its exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often believed to be a dish of mixed origins of French, Spanish, African, Native American, Caribbean and German influence. Enslaved African-Americans often exchanged or combined ingredients in order to make the dish, allowing it to serve as a means of community and identity.West Africans used the vegetable okra as a base for many dishes, including soups. In Louisiana, gumbo includes ingredients introduced by several cultural groups. Surviving records indicate that by 1764 Africans in New Orleans mixed cooked okra with rice to make a meal.Though highly unlikely, gumbo could be a derivation of traditional French soups, particularly the fish stew bouillabaisse. During the cold winters, Acadians generally cooked soups, using whatever ingredients were readily available. When the Acadians moved to Louisiana in the mid-18th century, they were unable to find many of their traditional ingredients, including turnips and cabbage. In this scenario, Acadian colonists substituted local ingredients for those commonly included in the original stew. Instead of the fish, settlers used shellfish. The dish was later modified to include ingredients common in other cultures.Some culinary experts in the early 20th century, including Celestine Eustis, maintained that gumbo was an early special occasion dish for native tribes. This is further implied by a late 18th-century Cajun practice. At that time, rice was a luxury for many Cajuns. They served gumbo over corn grits, a pairing common in the stews of native tribes. The use of corn and fil\u00e9 powder may imply that the dish was derived from native cuisine.These theories are intermixed in the local legend of the Frying Pan Revolt, or Petticoat Insurrection. According to legend, in 1722, female French colonists gathered in New Orleans at the home of Governor Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville, to protest the lack of familiar ingredients. Bienville's housekeeper, Madame Langlois, taught the women how to improve the basic gumbo. Langlois used okra, an ingredient which the women had previously been introduced to by the African people they were enslaving. Spanish and Choctaw introduced ingredients common in Choctaw cuisine \u2013 shrimp, crawfish, and fil\u00e9 powder.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe first written references to gumbo appear in the early 19th century. In 1802, John Sibley described \"the dish they call gumbo which is made principally of the ochre into a thick kind of soop  [sic] & eat with rice, it is the food of every body for dinner and supper.\" The following year, French governor Pierre Clement de Laussat hosted a soir\u00e9e in which 24 different gumbos were prepared. According to author Cynthia Lejeune Nobles, these two events \"give clues to gumbo's Spanish colonial popularity and illustrate that the dish could be both humble and refined\".An 1824 cookbook, Mary Randolph's The Virginia House-Wife, was the first to include a recipe for gumbo.  Called \"Gumbo \u2013 A West India Dish\", the simple recipe described how to boil okra and bore little resemblance to the stew commonly known as gumbo. The same book contained a recipe for \"Ochra Soup\" made with okra, onions, fowl, bacon, tomatoes, and lima beans thickened with flour. Although this recipe bore similarities to gumbo, it more closely resembled the Caribbean dish callaloo.A more familiar version of the dish was described in an 1879 cookbook by Marion Cabell Tyree.  Her Housekeeping in Old Virginia described \"Gumbo Filit A La Creole\", a fil\u00e9-based gumbo with chicken and oysters and spiced with allspice, cloves, red and black pepper, parsley, and thyme. The 1881 cookbook What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking, dictated by former slave Abby Fisher, contained three gumbo recipes. \"Oyster Gumbo Soup\" used a fil\u00e9 base, while \"Ochra Gumbo\" and \"Chicken Gumbo\" used okra as a base. Four years later, the cookbook La Cuisine Creole documented eight varieties of gumbo. None used sausage, but almost all of them contained ham.Until the 1970s, gumbo was primarily popular on the Gulf Coast of the United States. It gained a broader profile after the death of United States Senator Allen Ellender. A native of Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, Ellender had often cooked gumbo for his colleagues, including five American presidents. After Ellender died in 1972, the Senate directed that their cafeteria add Louisiana Creole Gumbo, made with seafood, to its menu in his honor. The dish became more widely popular in the 1980s, when chef Paul Prudhomme's popularity spurred interest in Creole and Cajun cooking.\n\n\n== Preparation and serving ==\nGumbo is cooked for a minimum of three hours, and often simmers all day. Meat (but not seafood) is often browned beforehand and removed from the heat. Okra and roux are cooked before other vegetables and seafood. Okra is removed from heat when it reaches the desired consistency, while roux remains in the pot. Seasoning vegetables are then added to the sauce. When these have turned to mush (more commonly called cooked down), the meat and okra are added to the pot along with water or stock, then boiled uncovered until the desired tenderness of the meat is reached. Seasonings, including red, black, and white pepper, bay leaves, thyme, hot sauce, and salt, are added to taste.  According to Nobles, \"proper seasoning of gumbo is essential, and in Louisiana adding just the right zing is considered an art\". Because seafood cooks fairly quickly, it is not added to the pot until the end of the process. As the gumbo finishes cooking, green onions and parsley are sometimes sprinkled on it. When desired, fil\u00e9 powder is added last.Creole and Cajun gumbos are served with hot rice, which helps the dish to feed a larger number of people. Gumbo z'herbes is served with rice on the side. Gumbo is almost always served directly from the pot on the stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a tureen on the table. Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Occasionally, gumbo is served as part of a larger menu.Soniat gives examples of the main types of creole gumbos, along with descriptions of family traditions about them.\n\n\n== Social aspects ==\nIn Cajun Foodways, C. Paige Gutierrez describes gumbo as \"an economical dish\" useful for \"feed[ing] a large number of people with a small amount of meat or seafood\".  Nobles concurs that \"one of the hallmarks of gumbo is that, with a big enough pot, it can easily be doubled or tripled and is always a good choice to feed a crowd\".  With this dish, cooks can use up small portions of various ingredients that were not sufficient for an individual meal.  The dish is an efficient way to use up leftover perishable meats and seafood. Gumbo, contrary to popular belief, is good for leftovers if it is frozen or refrigerated within two hours. Also, gumbo made without fil\u00e9 powder stores better because it will not get stringy.\nSince the 19th century, gumbo has often been served at social gatherings or other special occasions in Louisiana.  Local fais do-do (dance parties) usually provided gumbo beginning at midnight.  Many families \"have a gumbo\", or host a casual social gathering where friends and family chat and enjoy alcoholic beverages and gumbo.Gumbo is prepared and enjoyed by Louisianians of all races and ethnicities, and its multicultural influences have evolved it through the years. Gumbo is a feature in both urban and rural areas of Louisiana.\nIn rural Acadiana in southern Louisiana, gumbo is a central feature of Mardi Gras celebrations.  On Mardi Gras, local men wander from house to house and beg for gumbo ingredients in an event known as courir de Mardi Gras. Members of the local community then gather in a central location while the men cook the gumbo.  When it is ready, the group eats and dances until midnight, when Lent begins.Gumbo is the official cuisine of the state of Louisiana. Many southern Louisiana cooking competitions center around gumbo, and it is a central feature of many local festivals. The self-described \"Gumbo Capital of the World\", Bridge City, Louisiana, holds an annual Gumbo Festival. The festival features gumbo cooked in a cast-iron pot 3 ft (0.9 m) deep and 5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter.  More commonly, festival gumbo pots measure 2 ft (0.6 m) in depth and diameter.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCuisine of New Orleans\nList of regional dishes of the United States\nList of stews\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBienvenue, Marcelle; Brasseaux, Carl A.; Brasseaux, Ryan A.

Also, some numbers can be approximated more readily than others. Dirichlet proved in 1840 that the least readily approximable numbers are the rational numbers, in the sense that for every irrational number there exists infinitely many rational numbers approximating it to a certain degree of accuracy that only finitely many such rational approximations exist for rational numbers. Specifically, he proved that for any number \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n   there are infinitely many pairs of relatively prime numbers \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        p\n        ,\n        q\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (p,q)}\n   such that \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n          \n            \u03b1\n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                p\n                q\n              \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        <\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              q\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left|\\alpha -{\\frac {p}{q}}\\right|<{\\frac {1}{q^{2}}}}\n   if and only if \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha }\n   is irrational.\n51 years later, Hurwitz further improved Dirichlet's approximation theorem by a factor of \u221a5, improving the right-hand side from \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          q\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1/q^{2}}\n   to \n  \n    \n      \n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          \n            5\n          \n        \n        \n          q\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 1/{\\sqrt {5}}q^{2}}\n   for irrational numbers:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          |\n          \n            \u03b1\n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                p\n                q\n              \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        <\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              \n                \n                  5\n                \n              \n              \n                q\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\left|\\alpha -{\\frac {p}{q}}\\right|<{\\frac {1}{{\\sqrt {5}}q^{2}}}.}\n  The above result is best possible since the golden ratio \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n   is irrational but if we replace \u221a5 by any larger number in the above expression then we will only be able to find finitely many rational numbers that satisfy the inequality for \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b1\n        =\n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha =\\phi }\n  .\nFurthermore, he showed that among the irrational numbers, the least readily approximable numbers are those of the form \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              a\n              \u03d5\n              +\n              b\n            \n            \n              c\n              \u03d5\n              +\n              d\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {a\\phi +b}{c\\phi +d}}}\n   where \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi }\n   is the golden ratio, \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        ,\n        b\n        ,\n        c\n        ,\n        d\n        \u2208\n        \n          Z\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a,b,c,d\\in \\mathbb {Z} }\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        d\n        \u2212\n        b\n        c\n        =\n        \u00b1\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle ad-bc=\\pm 1}\n  .

If we omit these numbers, just as we omitted the rational numbers in Dirichlet's theorem, then we can increase the number \u221a5 to 2\u221a2.  Again this new bound is best possible in the new setting, but this time the number \u221a2, and numbers equivalent to it, limits the bound. If we don't allow those numbers then we can again increase the number on the right hand side of the inequality from 2\u221a2 to \u221a221/5, for which the numbers equivalent to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                \n                  221\n                \n              \n            \n            10\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {1+{\\sqrt {221}}}{10}}}\n   limits the bound. The numbers generated show how well these numbers can be approximated, this can be seen as a property of the real numbers.\nHowever, instead of considering Hurwitz's theorem (and the extensions mentioned above) as a property of the real numbers except certain special numbers, we can consider it as a property of each excluded number.

He was also known as Milan or Cveta.Born during the latter part of World War I in a small Syrmian village, \u0110ani\u0107 started playing football with Novi Sad outfit FK Slavija. At the age of 17, he moved to their more established crosstown rivals FK Vojvodina and immediately established himself in the first team. \nTwo years later, in 1936, together with brother Miran, he moved to Zagreb in pursuit of university studies. Parallel to studies he also played football with H\u0160K Gra\u0111anski, spending the 1936\u201337 season with them.\n\u0110ani\u0107's studies then took him to Czechoslovakia for a year where he also played one season for SK \u017didenice (5 league starts, 3 goals during 1937\u201338 season) and one season for SK Viktoria Plze\u0148 (1938\u201339).\nReturning to Zagreb, he also continued playing for Gra\u0111anski, eventually earning a callup to the Yugoslavia national team in 1940. His debut came on 3 November 1940 versus Germany in Zagreb. He would only play in three matches before the Nazi Germany invasion and quick dismemberment of Yugoslavia put an end to Yugoslav football activities. \u0110ani\u0107's last match in Yugoslavia jersey was also Yugoslavia's last outing\u2013a match versus Hungary on 23 March 1941 in Belgrade.\nSoon after the Royal Yugoslav Army defeat, and the establishment of Croatian Nazi-puppet state (NDH) under collaborationist Ustasha regime, \u0110ani\u0107 played first game for NDH national team in Vienna on 15 June 1941 versus Nazi Germany.

    "Lipe\u00f3n Formation": "The Lipe\u00f3n Formation is a Telychian to Pridoli geologic formation of southern Bolivia and northwestern Argentina. The formation comprises sandstones and siltstones. Plant fossils comprising rhyniophytes (specifically Aberlemnia, Steganotheca, Tarrantia, Hostinella and Cooksonia) are scattered throughout, with some abundant concentrations on micaceous bedding plains. The fossil flora is the oldest of South America.

    "Osvaldo Daniel": "Pablo Daniel \"Dani\" Osvaldo (Italian pronunciation: [\u02c8da\u02d0ni o\u02c8zvaldo]; born 12 January 1986) is a footballer who most recently played as a forward for Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Banfield. Born and raised in Argentina, Osvaldo represented the Italy national football team internationally.Osvaldo began his career at Hurac\u00e1n in 2005 and the following year moved to Italy in a co-ownership deal between Serie B clubs Atalanta and Lecce, later playing in the top flight for Fiorentina and Bologna. After a loan to RCD Espanyol, he joined the Spanish club on a permanent basis before earning a return to Italy to Roma for an initial fee of \u20ac15 million in 2011. He spent two seasons at the club and was then signed by Southampton, where he spent most of his time out on loan, at Juventus, Internazionale and Boca Juniors, before joining Porto. He returned to Boca in January 2016, but was later sacked by the club in May.\nOsvaldo qualified to represent Italy through his ancestry, having played initially for the nation's Under-21 team before making his senior debut in 2011.\nAt times, Osvaldo has been disciplined for having participated in various ferocious incidents with opponents, teammates and managers.\n\n\n== Club career ==\n\n\n=== Early career ===\n\nOsvaldo made his debut with Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n in 2005. After less than a year, he was signed by Italian side Atalanta, playing three matches in the 2005\u201306 Serie B season. In 2006, Atalanta agreed to a co-ownership deal which sent the player to Lecce, another Serie B team, where Osvaldo had the opportunity to play regularly, scoring eight goals in 31 appearances with the Giallorossi.\nAtalanta subsequently regained the full player's property and sold him to Fiorentina for \u20ac4.6 million.On 2 March 2008, Osvaldo headed in a cross from teammate Papa Waigo to give Fiorentina a 3\u20132 win in stoppage time over fierce rivals Juventus. He was then sent off for his goal celebration with a second yellow card, after having been booked earlier in the match, when he removed his team jersey and pretended to machine gun his own fans in a similar fashion to Fiorentina legend Gabriel Batistuta's goal celebration. His most important goal was a spectacular overhead kick against Torino on 18 May 2008.Osvaldo left Fiorentina on 20 January 2009 and joined Bologna on loan for \u20ac2 million. At the end of season, Bologna bought him for an additional \u20ac5 million, signing a four-year contract with the club. On 23 August 2009, Osvaldo scored the season-opening goal for Bologna against his former club Fiorentina and earned his team a point in the draw.\n\n\n=== Espanyol ===\nOn 10 January 2010, Spanish club RCD Espanyol announced that they had signed the Italo-Argentine forward on loan until June 2010, pending a medical examination. He made his La Liga debut when he came on as a 54th-minute substitute for Iv\u00e1n Alonso in the 0\u20132 away defeat to CA Osasuna.\nOn 3 June 2010, Osvaldo's loan was extended for another season, for \u20ac500,000, weeks after the player declared his interest of staying in Spain.\nOn 31 August, Osvaldo's loan deal with Espanyol was turned into a five-year-deal for a fee worth \u20ac4.6 million.\n\n\n=== Roma ===\n\nOn 25 August 2011, Osvaldo was sold to Roma for a fee of \u20ac15 million plus bonuses, whereby the bonus for goals (\u20ac500,000) and appearances (\u20ac250,000 each for 25th and 50th appearances; up to 100th) had been fully and partially activated; Roma also has the obligation to pay an additional \u20ac1 million if the team had qualifies for one of the Champions League seasons from 2012\u201313 to 2016\u201317, regardless of whether or not Osvaldo was a player of Roma at that time. On 22 September 2011, Osvaldo scored his first goal for the Lupi against Siena in a home game that ended 1\u20131. On 16 October, Osvaldo opened the scoring against Rome rivals Lazio in the Derby della Capitale. He scored his fifth goal against Novara on 5 November.\nOn 25 November, Osvaldo was apparently angry with teammate Erik Lamela after not receiving a pass during the 0\u20132 defeat at Udinese and was fined and suspended by his club for \"punching Lamela in the face.\"\nOn 19 March 2012, after three months, he scored again in a 1\u20130 victory over Genoa. He scored in the 2\u20131 loss against Milan and a week later in a 5\u20132 victory over Novara. He also scored the opening goal in a 3\u20131 victory over Udinese.\nOsvaldo opened the 2012\u201313 season with a goal against Catania in a 2\u20132 draw. On 2 September 2012, he scored his second goal of the season against Internazionale in a match that saw Roma win 1\u20133 against the Nerazzurri at the San Siro. He scored his third league goal, a penalty, against Juventus in a 4\u20131 defeat at Juventus Stadium. He scored a brace in a 4\u20132 win over Genoa and scored his sixth goal of the season in a 4\u20131 win against Palermo on 4 November. He also scored a goal against former club Fiorentina for a 4\u20132 win for Roma.\n\nOn 28 April 2013, Osvaldo scored his first hat-trick in Serie A against Siena in a convincing 4\u20130 home victory. Osvaldo finished the domestic season with a team-leading 16 goals, one over teammate Erik Lamela's 15, as Roma finished in sixth place.\nIn the club's 2013 Coppa Italia Final loss to Lazio (1\u20130), Osvaldo allegedly shouted at and insulted caretaking manager Aurelio Andreazzoli after the match for only being given 15 minutes of playing time off the substitutes' bench. Osvaldo also refused to attend the Coppa Italia awards ceremony in protest to the manager's decision.\n\n\n=== Southampton ===\nOsvaldo signed for Southampton on 18 August 2013 on a four-year deal for a \u20ac15.1 (\u00a312.8) million fee plus bonuses up to \u20ac2 million. Upon joining Southampton, Osvaldo was reunited with manager Mauricio Pochettino, who had managed him at Espanyol. He made his debut on 24 August in a 1\u20131 draw with  Sunderland, coming on as a substitute at the start of the second half. His first goal came in a 2\u20130 win over Crystal Palace in September, his second in early December in a 3\u20132 home loss to Aston Villa, and the next three days later in a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City, when The Guardian's reporter described how he \"bewildered Vincent Kompany before scoring with an exquisite lob from the corner of the box\".On 3 January 2014, Osvaldo was fined \u00a340,000 and banned for three matches after taking part in a touch-line fracas in the match against Newcastle United on 14 December, for which an FA independent regulatory commission found him \"guilty of violent conduct.\" Three weeks later, Southampton announced they had suspended Osvaldo for two weeks following an undisclosed training ground incident, later revealed to have been a fight with teammate Jos\u00e9 Fonte, ostensibly \"instigated by [Osvaldo].\"Following his departure, Osvaldo admitted that he had struggled to adapt to playing in England, describing English football as a  \"very physical type of game, with really tough tackling.\"On 1 July 2015, Southampton announced that they had terminated Osvaldo's contract.\n\n\n==== Juventus (loan) ====\nOn 31 January 2014, Osvaldo returned to Italy by signing on a free loan to Juventus for the remainder of the 2013\u201314 season, with the club having until 31 May 2014 to buy the rights to the player at the price of \u20ac19 million. Manager Antonio Conte revealed that Osvaldo willingly accepted a pay-cut to join the club.Osvaldo made his Juventus debut on 9 February against Hellas Verona, coming on as a substitute for Fernando Llorente in the 65th minute of a 2\u20132 draw. In the Round of 32 of the Europa League, Osvaldo scored in both legs as Juventus beat Trabzonspor 4\u20130 on aggregate. In the final away game against Roma on 11 May, Osvaldo scored the only goal of the game in the fourth minute of added time, seconds away from the end of the match. This was the only goal of 11 league matches in his loan spell.\n\n\n==== Internazionale (loan) ====\nOn 4 August 2014, Osvaldo returned again to Italy by signing on a free loan to Internazionale for the 2014\u201315 season, with Saphir Ta\u00efder moving in the opposite direction to Southampton. He scored his first goal on the 28th, the third of a 6\u20130 win over Stjarnan of Iceland which qualified Inter to the group stages of the Europa League. Three days later he featured in Serie A for the club for the first time, replacing fellow debutant Yann M'Vila after 56 minutes of a goalless draw at Torino. In his second league match on 14 September, he scored twice as Inter defeated Sassuolo 7\u20130 at the San Siro. He scored the winner in a 2\u20131 victory over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on 27 November, a result which confirmed that Inter would top their Europa League group with a game remaining. He was suspended by Inter on 21 January 2015 for not turning up to training for two days and not providing a reason for his absence, while previously being ostracised from the squad after falling out with strike partner Mauro Icardi.\n\n\n==== Boca Juniors (loan) ====\nOn 13 February 2015, Osvaldo returned to Argentina by signing on loan to Boca Juniors until the end of June. He said that playing for the club \"was always a lifelong dream\". Osvaldo scored in his debut for the side against Montevideo Wanderers in a Copa Libertadores match on 26 February. He scored his second and third goal against Zamora on 11 March, again in the Copa Libertadores.\n\n\n=== Porto ===\nOn 5 August 2015, Osvaldo joined Portuguese side Porto on a free transfer, following his release by Southampton. He scored his first goal for the Primeira Liga team on 4 October, as a substitute for Vincent Aboubakar in a 4\u20130 home win over CF Os Belenenses.\n\n\n=== Boca Juniors ===\nOsvaldo returned to Boca Juniors in January 2016, but in May he had his contract terminated after arguing with coach Guillermo Barros Schelotto after being caught smoking in the dressing room.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\nOn 31 August 2016, after Osvaldo had been a free agent for around 3 months, Italy's Rai Sport claimed that Serie A club Chievo tried to sign the former Southampton striker, but Osvaldo told the club that he had retired from football to focus on his music career.\n\n\n=== Return to Argentine football ===\nOn 6 January 2020, Osvaldo came out of retirement after four years to play for Primera Divisi\u00f3n club, Banfield for the first time since 1999, in his youth career. He signed a one year contract with the club. He departed in July 2020.\n\n\n== International career ==\n\nOsvaldo qualified for Italian citizenship through a great-grandfather who was born in Filottrano, Marche and emigrated to Argentina in the 19th century. Osvaldo had previously played for the Italy national under-21 football team in the team's victorious 2008 Toulon Tournament campaign, putting on a Man of the Match performance and scoring the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Chile in the final.On 5 October 2011, due to the injuries that caused the withdrawal of regular strikers Mario Balotelli and Giampaolo Pazzini, Osvaldo received his first call-up to play for the Italian national team for UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Serbia and Northern Ireland. Speaking of criticism by Lega Nord politicians for his decision to play for Italy, Osvaldo said \"The criticism from politicians is ridiculous. I have an Italian wife, Italian children and an Italian family and I also play in Serie A. Moreover, I have already sung the national anthem for the Under-21 team. I would have no problem facing Argentina in the future because it would mean I would be a part of the Italian national team.\" On 11 October 2011, he made his debut in the 3\u20130 victory over Northern Ireland.National team manager Cesare Prandelli dropped him from the squad after reports surfaced of Osvaldo shouting at his Roma coach, Aurelio Andreazzoli, during Roma's 1\u20130 defeat to Lazio in the 2013 Coppa Italia final. Osvaldo skipped the awards ceremony and then attacked Andreazzoli on Twitter.He was recalled by Prandelli for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Bulgaria and Malta. He netted his first two international goals for the Azzurri away against Bulgaria within the space of four minutes to put Italy in front after being a goal down early on. He added two more goals in the qualification campaign, almost exactly a year apart, away against Armenia, and Denmark. In the home qualifier against Denmark, on 16 October 2012 at the San Siro, Osvaldo was given a straight red card early in the second half for an elbow on Nicolai Stokholm.Osvaldo was not selected by Prandelli for the squad that contested the  2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil, nor for the following year's World Cup.\n\n\n== Style of play ==\nDescribed as a \"modern\", quick, tenacious, and physically strong striker, with good technique and dribbling skills, Osvaldo was capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his intelligent movement, positional sense, and his ability to make attacking runs. He was primarily known for his heading accuracy, his acrobatic ability in the air, and for his powerful and accurate striking ability both inside or outside the area, with both feet. In addition to his goalscoring ability, he was also capable of using his strength and control to link up with and play off of other forwards, and hold up the ball with his back to goal, to lay it off for teammates and provide them with assists. His former coach Zden\u011bk Zeman has described him as \"a force of nature\". Osvaldo also drew criticism throughout his career, however, for his inconsistency, aggressive character and lack of discipline, which led him to be involved in several confrontations with managers, opponents, teammates, and officials.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nOsvaldo met the Argentine actress Jimena Bar\u00f3n by phone, under the suggestion of actress Eugenia Tobal. He was playing in Italy at the time, and returned to Argentina to meet her under the pretense of a legal problem. She left the cast of Sos mi hombre and moved to Italy with him, and he left his wife Elena Braccini and his two daughters. He had a son with Jimena, and both of them returned to Argentina when he signed for Boca Juniors. He broke up with Bar\u00f3n in 2015, under controversial circumstances.Osvaldo has expressed his interest in music, with 'Wild Horses' by the Rolling Stones being his favourite song. Osvaldo also has interest in playing the guitar.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n=== Club ===\nAs of ?\n\n\n=== International ===\n\n\n=== International goals ===\nScores and results list Italy's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Osvaldo goal.\n\n\n== Honours ==\nAtalanta\nSerie B: 2005\u201306Roma\nCoppa Italia: runner-up 2012\u201313Juventus\nSerie A: 2013\u201314Boca Juniors\nArgentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 2015\nCopa Argentina: 2014\u201315\nSupercopa Argentina: runner-up 2015Italy U-21\nToulon Tournament: 2008\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of athletes who came out of retirement\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDani Osvaldo at Soccerbase",

The strange circumstances lead Li to Jack Lai, who is a master hypnotist and also in jail for manslaughter after taking the rap for a murder his wife committed under duress. Jack clearly knows who is responsible but is also clear that only he can identify the culprit. Li therefore springs Jack from jail and takes him along.

Jack returns to the scene to retrieve the diamonds and runs into Inspector Li. Together with Brenda they go after Ocean. On arrival they split up to search the complex.\nJack searches desperately for his wife, finally finding her inside the locked vacuum chamber. Brenda is taken by one of Ocean's men and although Li has Ocean cornered the situation becomes desperate, as he is forced to choose between his girlfriend and taking out Ocean. Finally, Li helps Jack to cause an explosion to wipe out Ocean. They hide in the second vacuum chamber as the oxygen cylinders detonate. Able now to reach his wife, Jack desperately tries to wake her to no avail. Mortally wounded, he lays his head on her lap as he dies. His wife comes to slowly and sees her husband, but is too late.\nLi finally realizes that there is more to life than work and begins to treat his girlfriend better.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nHeroic Duo at IMDb",

    "Artificial consciousness": "Artificial consciousness (AC), also known as machine consciousness (MC) or synthetic consciousness (Gamez 2008; Reggia 2013), is a field related to artificial intelligence and cognitive robotics. The aim of the theory of artificial consciousness is to \"Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact\" (Aleksander 1995).\nNeuroscience hypothesizes that consciousness is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the brain, called the neural correlates of consciousness or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct systems (e.g., computer systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of artificial intelligence through questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states.\n\n\n== Philosophical views ==\nAs there are many hypothesized types of consciousness, there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness.  In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into \"access\" and \"phenomenal\" variants.  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of \u201craw feels\u201d, \u201cwhat it is like\u201d or qualia (Block 1997).\n\n\n=== Plausibility debate ===\nType-identity theorists and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can only be realized in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution (Block 1978; Bickle 2003).In his article \"Artificial Consciousness: Utopia or Real Possibility,\" Giorgio Buttazzo says that a common objection to artificial consciousness is that \"Working in a fully automated mode, they [the computers] cannot exhibit creativity, unreprogrammation (which means can no longer be reprogrammed, from rethinking), emotions, or free will. A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components.\"For other theorists (e.g., functionalists), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness (Putnam 1967).\n\n\n==== Computational Foundation argument ====\nOne of the most explicit arguments for the plausibility of AC comes from David Chalmers.  His proposal, found within his article Chalmers 2011, is roughly that the right kinds of computations are sufficient for the possession of a conscious mind. In the outline, he defends his claim thus: Computers perform computations. Computations can capture other systems' abstract causal organization.\nThe most controversial part of Chalmers' proposal is that mental properties are \"organizationally invariant\". Mental properties are of two kinds, psychological and phenomenological. Psychological properties, such as belief and perception, are those that are \"characterized by their causal role\". He adverts to the work of Armstrong 1968 and Lewis 1972 in claiming that \"[s]ystems with the same causal topology\u2026will share their psychological properties\".\nPhenomenological properties are not prima facie definable in terms of their causal roles. Establishing that phenomenological properties are amenable to individuation by causal role, therefore, requires argument. Chalmers provides his Dancing Qualia Argument for this purpose.Chalmers begins by assuming that agents with identical causal organizations could have different experiences. He then asks us to conceive of changing one agent into the other by the replacement of parts (neural parts replaced by silicon, say) while preserving its causal organization. Ex hypothesi, the experience of the agent under transformation would change (as the parts were replaced), but there would be no change in causal topology and therefore no means whereby the agent could \"notice\" the shift in experience.\nCritics of AC object that Chalmers begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.\n\n\n=== Ethics ===\n\nIf it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an ethical issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer of a building of larger machine is a particular ambiguity. Should laws be made for such a case? Consciousness would also require a legal definition in this particular case. Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction (see below).\nIn 2021, the German philosopher Thomas Metzinger has demanded a global moratorium on synthetic phenomenology until 2050, on ethical grounds.\nThe rules for the 2003 Loebner Prize competition explicitly addressed the question of robot rights:\n\n61.

If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right.\n\n\n== Research and implementation proposals ==\n\n\n=== Aspects of consciousness ===\nThere are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by Bernard Baars (Baars 1988) and others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control, Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function, Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness (Aleksander 1995) and these are: The Brain is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered.\n\n\n==== Awareness ====\nAwareness could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of awareness. The results of the experiments of neuroscanning on monkeys suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling of the physical world, modeling of one's own internal states and processes, and modeling of other conscious entities.\nThere are at least three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness, you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it.  In goal awareness, you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.  In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.\nAl Byrd, the author of Superhuman Creators, defines consciousness, for animals, humans and artificial agents, as the effect of integrating and filtering many different types of affordance awareness; that is, awareness of the action possibilities in an environment. According to this definition, all agents that can perceive and act on affordances are conscious to some extent.\nBecause objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.\n\n\n==== Memory ====\nConscious events interact with memory systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.\nThe IDA model elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory, transient episodic memory, and procedural memory. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA, there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system. In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of Kanerva\u2019s Sparse distributed memory architecture.\n\n\n==== Learning ====\nLearning is also considered necessary for AC. By Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events (Baars 1988). By Axel Cleeremans and Luis Jim\u00e9nez, learning is defined as \"a set of philogenetically  [sic] advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments\" (Cleeremans 2001).\n\n\n==== Anticipation ====\nThe ability to predict (or anticipate) foreseeable events is considered important for AC by Igor Aleksander. The emergentist multiple drafts principle proposed by Daniel Dennett in Consciousness Explained may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate \"draft\" to fit the current environment.  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.\nRelationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism enabling the organism to predict events. An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.\n\n\n==== Subjective experience ====\nSubjective experiences or qualia are widely considered to be the hard problem of consciousness. Indeed, it is held to pose a challenge to physicalism, let alone computationalism. On the other hand, there are problems in other fields of science that limit that which we can observe, such as the uncertainty principle in physics, which have not made the research in these fields of science impossible.\n\n\n=== Role of cognitive architectures ===\n\nThe term \"cognitive architecture\" may refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind, or any portion or function thereof, including consciousness. In another context, a cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers. An example is QuBIC: Quantum and Bio-inspired Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so they can be the basis of a computer program. Also, the role of cognitive architecture is for the A.I. to clearly structure, build, and implement its thought process.\n\n\n=== Symbolic or hybrid proposals ===\n\n\n==== Franklin's Intelligent Distribution Agent ====\nStan Franklin (1995, 2003) defines an autonomous agent as possessing functional consciousness when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness as identified by Bernard Baars' Global Workspace Theory (Baars 1988, 1997). His brain child IDA (Intelligent Distribution Agent) is a software implementation of GWT, which makes it functionally conscious by definition. IDA's task is to negotiate new assignments for sailors in the US Navy after they end a tour of duty, by matching each individual's skills and preferences with the Navy's needs. IDA interacts with Navy databases and communicates with the sailors via natural language e-mail dialog while obeying a large set of Navy policies. The IDA computational model was developed during 1996\u20132001 at Stan Franklin's \"Conscious\" Software Research Group at the University of Memphis. It \"consists of approximately a quarter-million lines of Java code, and almost completely consumes the resources of a 2001 high-end workstation.\" It relies heavily on codelets, which are \"special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread.\" In IDA's top-down architecture, high-level cognitive functions are explicitly modeled (see Franklin 1995 and Franklin 2003 for details). While IDA is functionally conscious by definition, Franklin does \"not attribute phenomenal consciousness to his own 'conscious' software agent, IDA, in spite of her many human-like behaviours. This in spite of watching several US Navy detailers repeatedly nodding their heads saying 'Yes, that's how I do it' while watching IDA's internal and external actions as she performs her task.\" IDA has been extended to LIDA (Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent).\n\n\n==== Ron Sun's cognitive architecture CLARION ====\nCLARION posits a two-level representation that explains the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes.\nCLARION has been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological data. A number of well-known skill learning tasks have been simulated using CLARION that span the spectrum ranging from simple reactive skills to complex cognitive skills. The tasks include serial reaction time (SRT) tasks, artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, process control (PC) tasks, the categorical inference (CI) task, the alphabetical arithmetic (AA) task, and the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task (Sun 2002). Among them, SRT, AGL, and PC are typical implicit learning tasks, very much relevant to the issue of consciousness as they operationalized the notion of consciousness in the context of psychological experiments.\n\n\n==== Ben Goertzel's OpenCog ====\nBen Goertzel is pursuing an embodied AGI through the open-source OpenCog project. Current code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, being done at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.\n\n\n=== Connectionist proposals ===\n\n\n==== Haikonen's cognitive architecture ====\nPentti Haikonen (2003) considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: \"the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers.\" Rather than trying to achieve mind and consciousness by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes \"a special cognitive architecture to reproduce the processes of perception, inner imagery, inner speech, pain, pleasure, emotions and the cognitive functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the artificial neurons, without algorithms or programs\". Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be \"a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection.\" Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in autonomous agents that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many, e.g. Freeman (1999) and Cotterill (2003). A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by Haikonen (2003) was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. See Doan (2009) for a comprehensive introduction to Haikonen's cognitive architecture. An updated account of Haikonen's architecture, along with a summary of his philosophical views, is given in Haikonen (2012), Haikonen (2019).\n\n\n==== Shanahan's cognitive architecture ====\nMurray Shanahan describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars's idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation (\"imagination\") (Shanahan 2006). For discussions of Shanahan's architecture, see (Gamez 2008) and (Reggia 2013) and Chapter 20 of (Haikonen 2012).\n\n\n==== Takeno's self-awareness research ====\nSelf-awareness in robots is being investigated by Junichi Takeno at Meiji University in Japan. Takeno is asserting that he has developed a robot capable of discriminating between a self-image in a mirror and any other having an identical image to it, and this claim has already been reviewed (Takeno, Inaba & Suzuki 2005). Takeno asserts that he first contrived the computational module called a MoNAD, which has a self-aware function, and he then constructed the artificial consciousness system by formulating the relationships between emotions, feelings and reason by connecting the modules in a hierarchy (Igarashi, Takeno 2007). Takeno completed a mirror image cognition experiment using a robot equipped with the MoNAD system. Takeno proposed the Self-Body Theory stating that \"humans feel that their own mirror image is closer to themselves than an actual part of themselves.\" The most important point in developing artificial consciousness or clarifying human consciousness is the development of a function of self awareness, and he claims that he has demonstrated physical and mathematical evidence for this in his thesis. He also demonstrated that robots can study episodes in memory where the emotions were stimulated and use this experience to take predictive actions to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant emotions (Torigoe, Takeno 2009).\n\n\n==== Aleksander's impossible mind ====\nIgor Aleksander, emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering at Imperial College, has extensively researched artificial neural networks and claims in his book Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness that the principles for creating a conscious machine already exist but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand language. Whether this is true remains to be demonstrated and the basic principle stated in Impossible Minds\u2014that the brain is a neural state machine\u2014is open to doubt.\n\n\n==== Thaler's Creativity Machine Paradigm ====\nStephen Thaler proposed a possible connection between consciousness and creativity in his 1994 patent, called \"Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information\" (DAGUI), or the so-called \"Creativity Machine\", in which computational critics govern the injection of synaptic noise and degradation into neural nets so as to induce false memories or confabulations that may qualify as potential ideas or strategies. He recruits this neural architecture and methodology to account for the subjective feel of consciousness, claiming that similar noise-driven neural assemblies within the brain invent dubious significance to overall cortical activity. Thaler's theory and the resulting patents in machine consciousness were inspired by experiments in which he internally disrupted trained neural nets so as to drive a succession of neural activation patterns that he likened to stream of consciousness.\n\n\n==== Michael Graziano's attention schema ====\n\nIn 2011, Michael Graziano and Sabine Kastler published a paper named \"Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis\" proposing a theory of consciousness as an attention schema.  Graziano went on to publish an expanded discussion of this theory in his book \"Consciousness and the Social Brain\". This Attention Schema Theory of Consciousness, as he named it, proposes that the brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs by way of  an attention schema, analogous to the well studied body schema that tracks the spatial place of a person's body.  This relates to artificial consciousness by proposing a specific mechanism of information handling, that produces what we allegedly experience and describe as consciousness, and which should be able to be duplicated by a machine using current technology. When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one's own awareness is a schematized model of one's attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.\n\n\n=== \"Self-modeling\" ===\nHod Lipson defines \"self-modeling\" as a necessary component of self-awareness or consciousness in robots. \"Self-modeling\" consists of a robot running an internal model or simulation of itself.\n\n\n== Testing ==\nThe most well-known method for testing machine intelligence is the Turing test. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts the philosophy of science principles of theory dependence of observations. It also has been suggested that Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a human adult consciousness, but a human child consciousness, should be taken seriously.Other tests, such as ConsScale, test the presence of features inspired by biological systems, or measure the cognitive development of artificial systems.\nQualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Although various systems may display various signs of behavior correlated with functional consciousness, there is no conceivable way in which third-person tests can have access to first-person phenomenological features. Because of that, and because there is no empirical definition of consciousness, a test of presence of consciousness in AC may be impossible.\nIn 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments. He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures\u2019 consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine\u2019s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.\n\n\n== In fiction ==\n\nCharacters with artificial consciousness (or at least with personalities that imply they have consciousness), from works of fiction:\n\nAC \u2013 created by merging two AIs in the Sprawl trilogy by William Gibson\nAgents \u2013 in the simulated reality known as \"The Matrix\" in The Matrix franchise\nAgent Smith \u2013 began as an Agent in The Matrix, then became a renegade program of overgrowing power that could make copies of itself like a self-replicating computer virus\nA.L.I.E. \u2013 Sentient genocidal AI from the TV series The 100\nAM (Allied Mastercomputer) \u2013 the antagonist of Harlan Ellison's short novel I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.

    "Solinus (horse)": "Solinus (18 February 1975 \u2013 1979) was a British-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. A specialist sprinter, he won eight races over five and six furlongs in a ten race career which lasted from June 1977 until October 1978. As a two-year-old, he won three of his four races, including the Coventry Stakes in England and the Anglesey Stakes in Ireland. In the following year, he was the dominant sprinter in the British Isles, winning the Ballyogan Stakes, King's Stand Stakes, July Cup, and William Hill Sprint Championship. He was then retired to stud but died in 1979.\n\n\n== Background ==\nSolinus was a strong, lengthy, good-looking bay horse with a large white snip and white socks on his hind feet, bred by Len Hall at his stud near Rugby, Warwickshire. He was the best horse sired by Comedy Star, an American-bred stallion who raced in England, producing his best effort when finishing second to Brigadier Gerard in the Washington Singer Stakes. Solinus was the third foal of Cawston's Pride, an outstanding filly who won nine of her ten races and had previously produced the Coventry Stakes winner Cawston's Clown (also by Comedy Star).Solinus was sent to the United States and was consigned to the Saratoga Yearling Sales where he was bought for $75,000 by representatives of California businessman, Danny Schwartz. Solinus was returned to Europe and sent into training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle in County Kildare.\n\n\n== Racing career ==\n\n\n=== 1977: two-year-old season ===\nSolinus began his racing career in a maiden race over five furlongs in early June. He started the odds-on favourite and won by eight lengths. Later in the month, he was sent to England and moved up in class for the Group Three Coventry Stakes over six furlongs at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Lester Piggott, he started the 7/4 favourite and won by three lengths from Sharpen Your Eye, having taken the lead shortly after half way. Solinus did not reappear until late August, when he started 4/9 favourite for the Anglesey Stakes at the Curragh in which he was opposed by the Railway Stakes winner Thunor. He won very easily by six lengths from Embee Twist. In September, Solinus went back to England to contest the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead and quickened two furlongs from the finish but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten three quarters of a length by Sexton Blake. Piggott expressed the view that the seven furlong distance was too short for the colt.\n\n\n=== 1978: three-year-old season ===\nDespite Piggott's opinion, Solinus was campaigned exclusively at sprint distances in 1978. He made his first appearance in the Group Three Ballyogan Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse in early June and started second favourite behind the four-year-old Ballad Rock. Ridden by Tommy Murphy, Solinus disputed the lead from the start and won by a head from Ballad Rock. Three weeks later, Solinus was moved up in class for the Group One King's Stand Stakes over five furlongs at Royal Ascot in which he was ridden by Piggott and started the 4/6 favourite. He took the lead soon after the start and drew away from the field in the final furlong to win by four lengths from the Temple Stakes winner Oscilight. On his next appearance, Solinus started 4/7 favourite for the Group One July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. In what Timeform described as the best sprint race run in England that year, he took the lead after a furlong, turned back the challenge of Double Form, and held off the late run of the French-trained filly Sanedtki to win by a neck.At York Racecourse in August, Solinus started the 1/2 favourite for the Group Two William Hill Sprint Championship over five furlongs. He raced lazily, following the filly Smarten Up before taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths. Solinus returned to Ireland in September for the Airlie/Coolmore/Castle Hyde Championships over six furlongs at the Curragh. Despite rumours that he had sustained an injury a day earlier, he started favourite and won easily by three lengths from Spence Bay. In October, Solinus was sent to France for the Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. He started the 6/10 favourite despite an unfavourable draw but was beaten three lengths by the two-year-old French filly Sigy.\n\n\n== Assessment ==\nIn the Irish Free Handicap for 1977, Solinus was rated the second best colt of his generation, five pound behind his stable companion Try My Best. The independent Timeform organisation gave Solinus a rating of 124, six pounds behind the champion Try My Best. In the following year, Solinus was rated on 130 by Timeform, who named him the best sprinter of the year. The International Classification placed him eighth among the three-year-old colts of 1978, seven pounds below Ile de Bourbon. Vincent O'Brien described Solinus as the fastest sprinter he had ever trained.\n\n\n== Stud record ==\nSolinus was retired from racing and became a breeding stallion at the Longfield Stud in County Tipperary, having been valued at \u00a3800,000 for syndication. He died in 1979 after a single season at stud, with the best of his offspring being the filly Henry's Secret who finished second in the Princess Margaret Stakes and was rated 108 by Timeform in 1982.\n\n\n== Pedigree ==\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Trodmore Racecourse": "Trodmore Racecourse was the name of a fictitious racecourse, supposedly in Cornwall. On 1 August 1898 it was the subject of an elaborate punting scam.A man named Mr. Martin contacted the offices of a leading newspaper, The Sportsman, to inform them of a horse racing meeting he was holding the following day in the village of Trodmore. They were so impressed with the quality of the racecard that they promised to publish the runners, riders and results. \nPunters placed bets with several bookmakers, and collected as usual when results came through. Everything seemed to be going to plan until another leading newspaper, The Sporting Life, noticed that they had not been informed. \nThey did not want to be left out, so they copied the results 24 hours later, but there was a slight, but important, difference in the sets of results: one winning horse was given at 5-1 in the Sportsman, but at only 5-2 in the Sporting Life.Both newspapers, wanting to know the correct odds, attempted to contact the racecourse, and after they could not be contacted, notified police, who commenced a fraud investigation after Trodmore was nowhere to be found on any map of Cornwall. Those behind the scam were estimated to have made \u00a3100,000.Nobody was ever caught for the scam.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\"Top 25 most outrageous gambles - 9. MINISTRY OF DISINFORMATION\".

    "Battle of Modon": "The Battle of Modon took place in August 1500 during the war of 1499\u20131503 between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. The Ottomans, who had won the Battle of Zonchio (First Battle of Lepanto / Battle of Sapienza) the previous year, were again victorious under Admiral Kemal Reis.\nIn December 1499, the Venetians attacked Lepanto with the hope of regaining the territories which they lost with the Battle of Zonchio. Kemal Reis set sail from Cefalonia and retook Lepanto from the Venetians. He stayed in Lepanto between April and May 1500, where his ships were repaired by an army of 15,000 Ottoman craftsmen who were brought from the area. From there Kemal Reis set sail and bombarded the Venetian ports on the island of Corfu, and in August 1500 he once again defeated the Venetian fleet. He bombarded the fortress of Modon from the sea and captured the town. He later engaged with the Venetian fleet off the coast of Coron and captured the town along with a Venetian brigantine. From there he sailed towards the Island of Sapientza (Sapienza) and sank the Venetian galley \"Lezza\". In September 1500, Kemal Reis assaulted Voiussa and in October he appeared at Cape Santa Maria on the Island of Lefkada before ending the campaign and returning to Constantinople in November.\nWith the Battle of Modon, the Ottoman fleet and army quickly overwhelmed most of the Venetian possessions in Greece.\nModon and Coron, the \"two eyes of the Republic\", were lost. Ottoman cavalry raids reached Venetian territory in northern Italy, and, in 1503, Venice again had to seek peace, recognizing the Ottoman gains.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nOttoman Navy\n\n\n== References ==\nJohn E.

    "Gadiformes": "Gadiformes  are an order of ray-finned fish, also called the Anacanthini, that includes the cod and its allies. Many major food fish are in this order. They are found in marine waters throughout the world and the vast majority of the species are found in temperate or colder regions (tropical species are typically deep-water). A few species may enter estuaries but only one, the burbot (Lota lota), is a freshwater fish.\nCommon characteristics include the positioning of the pelvic fins (if present), below or in front of the pectoral fins. Gadiformes are physoclists, which means their swim bladders do not have a pneumatic duct. The fins are spineless. Gadiform fish range in size from the codlets, which may be as small as 7 cm (2.8 in) in adult length, to the Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua, which reaches up to 2 m (6.6 ft).\n\n\n== Timeline of genera ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Khimshiashvili": "Khimshiashvili (Georgian: \u10ee\u10d8\u10db\u10e8\u10d8\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8) was a surname of the Georgian noble families, with their bases in the regions of Kakheti and Adjara.Princedom of Adjara, Akhaltsikhe & Duke of Kakheti in Eastern Georgia:  A Kakhetian family was princely nobility of Georgia and, then, of the Russian Empire, while the Adjarian Khimshiashvili were important frontier beys under the Ottoman Empire and wielded noticeable influence in this part of southwestern Caucasus throughout the 19th century. The Russians rendered their family name as Khimshiyev (Russian: \u0425\u0438\u043c\u0448\u0438\u0435\u0432) and as Adzharsky (\u0410\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \"of Adjara\"), while to the Turks they came to be known as Ham\u015fio\u011flu.\n\n\n== In Kakheti ==\nThe Khimshiashvili were purportedly descended from the Khimshi Zedginidze*,from a Roman officer who accompanied Pompey on his Caucasian campaign in 65 BC which first appears in the Georgian annals in the 11th century Kakhetian princes (tavadi) attached to the Russo\u2013Georgian Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783. On Russian annexation of Georgia, they had their rank (knyaz) recognized by the new regime, officially in 1850. Many of the Khimshiashvili pursued military careers, such as Georgy Khimshiyev (1836\u20131917), general of artillery in the Imperial Russian ranks, and Gogi Khimshiashvili (1892\u20131923), colonel in the Georgian service, who was executed by the Soviet regime.\n\n\n== In Adjara ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nKhimshiashvili (Georgian: \u10ee\u10d8\u10db\u10e8\u10d8\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8) was a Georgian very oldest noble family,known from the eleventh (XI) century.\nThey were Princedom of Adjara & Kakheti in eastern Georgia, with their \"KNIAZ\" and Prince-Master of the Horse; Lord High Constable titles. Also some of family members sometimes was recognized Russian General by the Russian Empires. Some of family's members was appointed Vezir of Sultan and/or \"Pasha\" by Ottoman's Sultans. Khimshiashvili family was also called DUKE of Aragvi, Gurelli and Akhaltsikhe. Their root was came from most strong, and noble name of Georgia: Khimshi Zedginidze* and his generation was called Khimshiashvili.*\nThe House of Zevdginidze (\u10d6\u10d4\u10d5\u10d3\u10d2\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8\u10eb\u10d4) or Zedginidze (\u10d6\u10d4\u10d3\u10d2\u10d8\u10dc\u10d8\u10eb\u10d4), Khimshiashvili (\u10ee\u10d8\u10db\u10e8\u10d8\u10d0\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8)** which subsequently assumed the name of its principal office-fief, of Amilakhvari (Prince-Master of the Horse Lord High Constable), is traceable in the province of Upper Kartli (now Inner Kartli) to the middle of the fourteenth century. A family legend holds it, though, that they descend from a Roman officer who accompanied Pompey on his Caucasian campaign in 65 BC. His descendants are said to have attained to Georgian nobility in the 11th century.  \nSince then they are called Amikhvarais and are divided by several names:\n    1. Revazis shvili [shvili-son, child];\n    2.Khimshiashvili \n    2.Qaikhosros shvili;\n    3. Bezhanis shvili;\n    4. Erastis shvili and his nephews;\n    5. Givis shvili.\n\n\n=== Rise and fall ===\nThe first documented Adjarian Khimshiashvili was Abdullah Bey, killed during his raid into the neighboring Georgian Principality of Guria in 1784. His son Selim Bey sought to bring all of Ottoman Georgia under his rule and staged a coup in Akhaltsikhe in order to gain control of the Eyalet of Childir. After Selim's death in an Ottoman punitive expedition in 1815, his sons and successors, especially, Ahmed Bey, cooperated with the Ottoman government and extended their influence over the territory from the Gurian hills to the Oltu \u00c7ay. The Ottomans had to rely on these beys in their efforts to counter the Russian expansion. During the Russo-Turkish War (1828\u201329), they posed more threat to the Russians than the Ottoman \"new model\" army operating in the Caucasus. During the following two decades, the Ottoman government's \"westernizing\" tanzimat eliminated the semi-autonomous rule of derebeys. A revolt against this policy led by Kor Hussein Bey Khimshiashvili was put down in the 1840s. Eventually, \u015eerif Bey of Adjara, a Khimshiashvili, defected to the Russians during the war of 1877\u201378 and, thereby, was able to retain his property after the Russian takeover of Adjara. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921, many of his numerous descendants fled to Turkey, where they still live as Ham\u015fio\u011flu.\n\n\n== References ==",
    "The World's Ransoming": "The World's Ransoming is a concerto for cor anglais and orchestra by the Scottish composer James MacMillan.  It was the first of three interrelated compositions in MacMillan's Easter triptych Triduum commissioned by the London Symphony Orchestra.  Its world premiere was given by the soloist Christine Pendrill (to whom the piece is dedicated) and the London Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Kent Nagano at the Barbican Centre on 11 July 1996.\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe World's Ransoming was composed between 1995 and 1996.  It has a duration of roughly 21 minutes and is cast in one continuous movement.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe World's Ransoming was the first of three pieces comprising MacMillan's Easter triptych Triduum, which would later include the composer's Cello Concerto and his Symphony: 'Vigil'.  In the score program notes, MacMillan wrote, \"The World's Ransoming focuses on Maundy Thursday and its musical material includes references to plainsongs for that day, Pange lingua and Ubi caritas as well as a Bach chorale (Ach wie nichtig) which I have heard being sung in the eucharistic procession to the altar of repose.\"  The title of the piece comes from the words of Thomas Aquinas's hymn Pange Lingua.\n\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\nThe work is scored for a solo cor anglais and an orchestra consisting of two flutes (both doubling piccolo), oboe, two clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons (2nd doubling contrabassoon), four horns, two trumpets, three trombones, timpani, percussion, and strings.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nArnold Whittall of Gramophone compared the work favorably to MacMillan's The Confession of Isobel Gowdie, writing, \"The World's Ransoming is more temperate, with more substance to its passages of lament, and with more power to the assaults on spirituality which it depicts.\"  The music was similarly praised by BBC Music Magazine and Tim Ashley of The Guardian, who wrote, \"The World's Ransoming contrasts pacifism with violence in a powerful meditation on the events leading to the Crucifixion.\"\n\n\n== Recordings ==\nThe World's Ransoming has twice been commercially recorded.  The first recording, performed by the Pendrill and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4, was released through BIS Records on 23 March 1999.  The second recording, performed by Pendrill and the London Symphony Orchestra under Colin Davis, was released through the orchestra's label on 8 January 2008.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of compositions by James MacMillan\nList of concertos for English horn\n\n\n== References ==",

He also recorded several singles in the mid-1950s, including \"Football Rock\" on Decca, and \"Girl Girl Girl\" on Roulette.Hammer wrote a song, \"Great Balls of Fire\", and submitted it to songwriter Paul Case, who liked the title but not the song itself. Case passed the idea to Otis Blackwell, and commissioned him to write a song of the same title for inclusion in the film Jamboree, with Hammer taking a half share of the songwriting royalties. The song was successfully recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis. Hammer also wrote \"Peek-A-Boo\", a hit for the Cadillacs.

There, he recorded a series of twist songs, including \"Kissin' Twist\", which became a big hit in Belgium, Germany, France and Sweden.

The patent was for new traction wheels for trains for going uphill with heavy loads.\n\n\n== U.S. Senate career ==\nThe state legislature elected Ruggles as a Democratic-Republican (Jacksonian) to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Peleg Sprague. He was later elected for the full term beginning March 4, 1835, and in total served from January 20, 1835, to March 3, 1841. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1840.\nDuring his tenure in Congress, Ruggles had served as chairman of the Committee on Patents and Patent Office (25th Congress), and in 1836 framed the bill for the reorganization of the United States Patent Office. He was known for his interest in inventions and patents, and because of his legislative accomplishments in this area he has become known as the \"Father of the U.S. Patent Office\". Ruggles also was an inventor and the patent-holder of U.S. Patent 1, issued July 13, 1836. His invention was a type of train wheel designed to reduce the adverse effects of the weather on the track. This was not the first patent ever from the USPTO; the previous patents were destroyed by fire and afterwards called the X-Patents, and new patents afterwards were numbered from 1 again. Ruggles received the first patent granted under the new system; Samuel Hopkins received the first X-Patent.\n\n\n== Retirement and death ==\nIn retirement, Ruggles resumed the practice of law in Thomaston. There he made several more inventions and was well known as a political writer and orator. Ruggles was wealthy; he and his wife Margaret George Ruggles had children and lived in the largest house on the town's Main Street. He died in 1874 a few months before reaching age 85. He is interred in the Elm Grove Cemetery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPatent Office 1836 fire\nPatent Office 1877 fire\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\"Ruggles, John.\" The Political Graveyard. http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/ruggles.html#R9M0JBIAQUnited States Congress. \"John Ruggles (id: R000502)\".

    "Artifact-centric business process model": "Artifact-centric business process model  represents an operational model of business processes in which the changes and evolution of business data, or business entities, are considered as the main driver of the processes. The artifact-centric approach, a kind of data-centric business process modeling, focuses on describing how business data is changed/updated, by a particular action or task, throughout the process.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn general, a process model describes activities conducted (i.e. activity-centric) in order to achieve business goals, informational structures, and organizational resources. Workflows, as a typical process modeling approach, often emphasize the sequencing of activities (i.e., control flows), but ignore the informational perspective or treat it only within the context of single activities. Without a complete view of the informational context, business actors often focus on what should be done instead of what can be done, hindering operational innovations.\nBusiness process modeling is a foundation for design and management of business processes. Two key aspects of business process modeling are a formal framework that integrates both control flow and data, and a set of tools to assist all aspects of a business process life cycle. A typical business process life cycle includes at least a design phase, concerned with the \u201ccorrect\u201d realization of business logic in a resource-constrained environment, and an operational phase, concerned with optimizing and improving execution (operations). Traditional business process models emphasize a procedural and/or graph-based paradigm (i.e., control flow). Thus, methodologies to design workflow in those models are typically process-centric. It has been argued that a data-centric perspective is more useful for designing business processes in the modern era.\nIntuitively, business artifacts (or simply artifacts) are data objects whose manipulations define the underlying processes in a business model. Recent engineering and development efforts have adopted the artifact approach for design and analysis of business models. An important distinction between artifact-centric models and traditional data flow (computational) models is that the notion of the life cycle of the data objects is prominent in the former, while not existing in the latter.\n\n\n== Research and history ==\nArtifact-centric modeling is an area of growing interest. Nigam and Caswell introduced the concept of business artifacts and information-centric processing of artifact lifecycles. Kumaran et al.'s further studies on artifact-centric business processes can be found here. Bhattacharya described a successful business engagement which applies business artifact techniques to industrialize discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. Liu et al. formulated nine commonly used patterns in information-centric business operation models and developed a computational model based on Petri Nets. Bhattacharya, K., et al. provides a formal model for artifact-centric business processes with complexity results concerning static analysis of the semantics of such processes. Kumaran et al. presented the formalized information-centric approach to discovering business entities from activity-centric process models and transforming such models into artifact-centric business process models. An algorithm was provided to achieve this transformation automatically.\nOther approaches related to artifact-centric modelling can be found in,. Van der Aalst et al. provides a case-handling approach where a process is driven by the presence of data objects instead of control flows. A case is similar to the business entity concept in many respects. Wang and Kumar proposed the document-driven workflow systems which is designed based on data dependencies without the need for explicit control flows. Muller et al. also introduced the framework for the data-driven modelling of large process structures, namely COREPRO. The approach reduces modelling efforts significantly and provides mechanisms for maintaining data-driven process structures.\nAnother related thread of work is the use of state machines to model object lifecycles. Industries often define data objects and standardize their lifecycles as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations. Redding et al. and K\u00fcster et al. give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object lifecycles. In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object lifecycles glued by events.\nMore recent and closely related work on artifact-centric process model can be found in. Gerede and Su developed a specification language ABSL to specify artifact behaviours in artifact-centric process models. The authors showed decidability results of our language for different cases and provided key insights on how artifact-centric view can affect the specification of desirable business properties. Gerede et al. identified important classes of properties on artifact-centric operational models focusing on persistence, uniqueness and arrival properties. They proposed a formal model for artifact-centric operational models to enable a static analysis of these properties and showed that the formal model guarantees persistence and uniqueness.\nFritz, Hull, and Su formulated the technical problem of goal-directed workflow construction in the context of declarative artifact-centric workflow, and develop results concerning the general setting, design time analysis, and the synthesis of workflow schemas from goal specifications. The work is among the important initial steps along the path towards eventual support for tools that enable substantial automation for workflow design, analysis, and modification. Deutsch et al. introduced the artifact system model, which formalizes a business process modelling paradigm that has recently attracted the attention of both the industrial and research communities. The problem of automatic verification of artifact systems, with the goal of increasing confidence in the correctness of such business processes is also studied.\nSira and Chengfei proposed a novel view framework for artifact-centric business processes. It consists of artifact-centric process model, process view model, a set of consistency rules, and the construction approach for building process views. The formal model of artifact-centric business processes and views, namely ACP, is defined and used to describe artifacts, services, business rules that control the processes, as well as views. They developed a bottom-up abstraction mechanism for process view construction to derive views from underlying process models according to view requirements. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between constructed view and its underlying process. This work can be considered as one approach to the abstraction, i.e., generalization of artifact-centric business processes. The framework has also been extended to address modelling and change validation of inter-organizational business processes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBusiness architecture\nBusiness Model Canvas\nBusiness plan\nBusiness process illustration\nBusiness process mapping\nBusiness Process Modeling Notation\nCapability Maturity Model Integration\nExtended Enterprise Modeling Language\nGeneralised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology\nModel-driven engineering\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

    "Glyptothorax": "Glyptothorax is a genus of catfishes order Siluriformes of the family Sisoridae. It is the most species-rich and widely distributed genus in the family with new species being discovered on a regular basis. These species are distributed in the Black Sea basin, northern Turkey, south and east to the Yangtze River drainage in China and south throughout Indo-China to Java, Indonesia. They are found in Asia Minor (in the Tigris and Euphrates River drainages)  and southwards to Southeast Asia. The genus is very diverse in the Indian subcontinent. Southeast Asian species tend to have restricted distributions.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis genus is easily distinguished from other sisorids by having an adhesive apparatus on the thorax with grooves parallel or oblique to the longitudinal axis of the body, as opposed to grooves transverse to the longitudinal axis of body or the thoracic adhesive apparatus entirely absent. The dorsal fin and pectoral fins have strong spines. The dorsal fin spine is smooth or serrate on the front edge and smooth or finely serrated on the posterior edge. The pectoral fin spine is serrated on the front edge. The head is small and depressed and the snout is conical. The body is elongate, from moderately to greatly depressed. The skin is either smooth or tuberculate. The eyes are small and dorsally placed. The lips are thick, fleshy and often papillate. The maxillary barbels have a well-developed membrane and a soft base. The gill openings are wide. The paired fins are plaited and modified to form an adhesive apparatus in some species of Glyptothorax.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nLike other sisorids, these fish are rheophilic, that is they inhabit fast-flowing streams, where they are adapted to live by using the adhesive apparatus on the underside to attach themselves to rocks and prevent being washed away.\n\n\n== Species ==\nThere are currently 104 recognized species in this genus:\n\nGlyptothorax alaknandi Tilak, 1969\nGlyptothorax anamalaiensis Silas, 1952\nGlyptothorax annandalei Hora, 1923\nGlyptothorax armeniacus (L.

    "Geryon trispinosus": "Geryon trispinosus is a species of crab that lives in deep water in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n== Description ==\nGeryon trispinosus is a small crab, reaching a carapace length of up to 40 millimetres (1.6 in). The carapace is roughly hexagonal in shape, and reddish brown in colour. It is broader than it is long, with three conspicuous teeth on either side at the front. The pereiopods are paler than the carapace; they are quite narrow and long, with the third and fourth pairs being the longest.\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nGeryon trispinosus is found in the north-eastern Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from Norway in the north to the Bay of Biscay in the south, and also includes the Canary Islands.\n\n\n== Life cycle and ecology ==\nFemales reach sexual maturity at a carapace length of 12\u201315 mm (0.5\u20130.6 in), while males reach it at 35 mm (1.4 in). Eggs are laid in April, and the eggs hatch into planktonic larvae, which eventually settle as juveniles at depths greater than 1,000 metres (3,300 ft). As they grow, these crabs migrate upwards, with the adults only found at depths of less than 800 m (2,600 ft). Due to the shallow slopes in the north-eastern Atlantic, these migrations involve distances of 20\u201350 kilometres (12\u201331 mi).G. trispinosus occurs in the same localities as the squat lobster Munida sarsi. M. sarsi lives abundantly at depths of 700\u2013800 metres (2,300\u20132,600 ft), and out-competes young G. trispinosus, and limits their survival to those depths where it is absent. Another squat lobster, M. tenuimana, lives at greater depths, but in much lower numbers, and therefore does not impact the survival of G. trispinosus as severely.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nGeryon trispinosus was first described in 1803 by Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst, as \"Cancer trispinosus\", although he described the locality erroneously as the East Indies. In 1837, Henrik Nikolai Kr\u00f8yer erected the genus Geryon, setting \"Geryon tridens\" as the type species. This was later synonymised with Herbst's species. In 1989, Raymond B.

    "Rathborney": "Rathborney, sometimes Rathbourney, (Irish: R\u00e1th Boirne) is a civil parish in the Barony of Burren in County Clare, Ireland.\n\n\n== Location ==\nRathborney parish is in the Barony of Burren, 8.5 miles (13.7 km) from the village of Burren on the road to Ennistymon. It is 2.25 miles (3.62 km) SSW of Ballyvaughan and includes territory  in the valley of Ballyvaughan, the slopes of surroundings hills and the side valley of the Rathborney river (also known as Feenagh Valley). The parish is 5 by 4 miles (8.0 by 6.4 km), and covers 9,633 acres (3,898 ha). The highest point is Cappanavulla hill, on the northern boundary, at 1,023 feet (312 m) above sea level. Much of the parish is rocky hill pasture, and there is some blanket bog in the west of the parish.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nIn 1841, the parish had a population of 1,000 in 177 houses.\n\n\n== Antiquities ==\n\nThe parish includes numerous prehistoric and historic sites, including several ringforts such as the earthen Ballyallaban ringfort and the limestone Cahermore ringfort. At Cahermacnaghten stands the central cashel of the O'Davoran family with the ruins of their law school nearby. In Faunarooska townland there are several wedge tombs. In Gleninsheen townland, the Gleninsheen Gorget was discovered in 1932. There are also remains of more wedge tombs, known as the Gleninsheen wedge tombs.\nThere are two church ruins within 500 m of each other, both in Croagh North townland. One is known as Glenaraha (Gleann na Ratha or Valley of the R\u00e1ths or Ringforts), with a ringfort (Doontorpa) nearby. It is a large t-shaped church with a vestry to the east. According to a sign in the west annexe, it was built in 1795 by the 1st Marquess of Buckinghham for use by his tenants. By 1837 the church had been enlarged and 40 acres of land allotted for use by the parish priest.:\u200a95\u20136\u200aThe other church is known as Rathborney Church, from R\u00e1th Bhoirne (the R\u00e1th of the Burren) and was built inside the remains of another ringfort. Most of the remains date to the 15th century, when a smaller earlier church was almost completely rebuilt. Parts of the east and north wall date to that original structure. Later features include the ornate east window and the pointed arch of the doorway in the south wall. A graveyard surrounds the church and it includes several crude grave markers of unknown date. There is also a bullaun. Its presence and the fact that the original church was built before 1302 inside a ringfort may indicate a monastic origin for this site.:\u200a95\u200a The church ruin both inside and out is an active graveyard private to local families.\nThe rebuilt tower house and hotel of Gregans Castle are located in the parish, in the townlands of Gregan West and Gregan East, respectively.\n\n\n== Townlands and hamlets ==\nThe parish contains the townlands of Ballyallaban, Berneens, Burrenwee, Cahermacnaghten, Cahermacun, Cloonmartin, Cullaun, Cregavockoge, Croagh North, Croagh South, Donnyvardan, Drumbrickaun, Faunarooska, Feenagh, Garracloon, Gleninsheen, Gragan East, Gragan West, Lisgoogan, Lislarheenmore, Lismacsheedy, Lismacteige, Lissylisheen, Poulacapple and Poulnabrucky.\nThe hamlets in 1845 were Knockatun, Lissaroo, Cahirmacun and Croagh.\n\n\n== References ==\nCitations\n\nSources\n\n\n== External links ==",
    "WWE 2K (video game)": "WWE 2K, formerly known as the WWF/E SmackDown! series, SmackDown vs. Raw, or simply the WWE series, is a series of professional wrestling sports video games developed and released annually since 2000. Yuke's was the sole developer of the games prior to 2K14. It was then co-developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts from WWE 2K14 until WWE 2K20, when Yuke's had left the development team. It is published by 2K Sports. The premise of each game in the series is to emulate the sport of professional wrestling, more specifically that of WWE, and present improvements over the previous installments. The games feature WWE match types, storylines and wrestlers.\n\n\n== Development ==\nEvery game produced in the WWE 2K series until 2019 was developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and published by 2K Sports. From 2000 to 2012, the publisher was THQ. The game engine was originally based on the one used by the Japanese professional wrestling video game series Toukon Retsuden, which was also developed by Yuke's. Before the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, the only communication possible in season mode was through subtitles. Voice over, however, was included in season mode with the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw. WWE superstars record a script, which is then assigned to the voice of the corresponding superstar in the game. With the exception of WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, pre-recorded commentary by WWE commentators has been included in each game since the release of WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It.Yuke's studios in Yokohama, Japan, worked with WWE writers to create storylines for the season modes of each game. When WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 was released for more than one console, Yuke's had to port their original game codes that make up each game mode and graphic designs to a new game engine that supported the new consoles. When new features are added to WWE 2K games, developers have to create new gaming codes for the features. Along with the features, the developers have to test the game for any errors. An improvement done yearly by Yuke's with each release of a WWE 2K game is the polygon count for the 3D models of the superstars in each game. Technical limitations had occurred through the series which lead the developers to adjust custom characters while loading. Beginning with WWE '12, promotion render art photos were used up to WWE 2K16; from WWE 2K17 on, the promotion render art was replaced with in-game rendering to accommodate created characters to lessen loading times. The in-game announcer calls out the names when selecting the wrestler beginning in WWE 2K17 and continues through WWE 2K18 (not in WWE 2K19 or 2K20); as for the in game render photos in the 2K19 title, the wrestlers stand still without posing differently than the previous two installments. During the Wrestlers' entrances (whether solo tag team or trio tag team) the commentary is expanded to an extensive library of words relative to the real life counterparts of WWE superstars. in WWE 2K22, the promotional poster photos make a return.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe series was originally named SmackDown!, after WWE's own SmackDown television program. The first release in the series was WWF SmackDown! in March 2000, which along with these subsequent titles, remained exclusive to Sony's PlayStation consoles. After the brand extension, the series was retitled SmackDown! vs. Raw in 2004, to indicate the Raw brand was also featured. Within a few years, the series had expanded to a yearly release cycle for various seventh-generation consoles as well as mobile devices. Yuke's had also released the games in Japan under the name of Exciting Pro Wrestling. However, after SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006, THQ took over as the Japanese publisher and the Japanese releases adopted the western name. The series was later renamed as just simply WWE, starting from 2011 and 2012.\nAfter THQ's dissolution in January 2013, it was reported that the publishing rights for the WWE video game series were acquired by Take-Two Interactive. Take-Two confirmed the acquisition in February, saying that it would also retain the services of Yuke's and the THQ staff that worked on the WWE series. WWE 2K14 was the first game to be released under the 2K brand.In early 2016, WWE and 2K signed an agreement to extend 2K's licence of the series, exact details of which are unknown. 2019's WWE 2K20 became the first game under the 2K banner not to be developed by Yuke's. WWE 2K20 was instead developed by Visual Concepts, who had worked on previous games.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe first game in the series, WWF SmackDown! had a clear cut system for moves such as combining an arrow key with the circle button for grappling and moves and combining an arrow key with the X button for striking moves. Most of the later games, from WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role to WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006 used the aforementioned control scheme. When WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007 was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called \"Ultimate Control moves.\" Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a suplex grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an inverted suplex slam. Before the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, in order for players to force a superstar to submit, they had to tap buttons to move a marker towards the end of the meter labeled \"Submit\", and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards \"Escape\". Included with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the analog sticks of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the submission hold.Every game in the SmackDown vs. Raw series used to have the amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, measured with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed\u2014the more damage that is done to that specific body part, the more likely it is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, the more likely it is for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.Included with the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw was the option of fighting \"dirty\" or \"clean\". When players select \"dirty\", the superstar is booed by the audience in the game; conversely, the \"clean\" superstar is cheered by the audience. With the \"dirty\" or \"clean\" option comes the inclusion of performing a special maneuver when playing. Players using a \"dirty\" superstar must direct their superstar into building up their \"dirty\" meter by performing \"dirty\" tactics, such as attacking the referee or taking the pad off the ring's turnbuckle. Unlike performing dirty tactics, \"clean\" superstars build their meters by performing \"clean\" tactics, such as an aerial technique or performing a taunt. When \"dirty\" superstars' meters build up, they are able to perform a signature low blow; likewise, \"clean\" superstars can perform their signature move at double its normal damage.With the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was the inclusion of a stamina system, which was a measure of the superstars' stamina. The stamina system was measured by a meter on the HUD; the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the superstar or holds down a selected button that increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running. If the meter decreased completely, the superstar fell to the ground until the meter increased. This system is disabled by default for WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 and was disabled until 2K took over the series, bringing in a similar system with WWE 2K16.The weak/strong grapple system from the past games was removed from WWE '12 onwards. Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. \"Dynamic Comebacks\" gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New \"wake up taunts\" bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as pounding on the ground before RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a \"Breaking Point\" submission minigame.OMG! moments were introduced to WWE '13. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to WWE '13, so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show, super heavyweights like  now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In WWE '13 alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings \u2013 \"Quick\", \"Normal\" and \"Epic\" \u2013 will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.To overhaul the gameplay of the series, 2K15 added five times more animation data than WWE 2K14, containing over fifty days work of motion capture by the WWE superstars, and over four times the amount of dialogue for commentary compared to 2K14 was recorded. The general gameplay of the game was also revised, with the wrestlers being divided once more into classes, as was present in the Smackdown vs. Raw series. This created what is known as in-ring psychology. The classes (brawlers, giants, grapplers and high-flyers) all provide different and unique movesets within the game to diversify its mechanics.WWE 2K16 introduced Working Holds, which allows the player to go through a collar-elbow tie-up situation in order to either damage the opponent or regain stamina to reverse the tide in the match. Dirty Pins now came in various animations, and AI for the referee was also improved; for example, a referee may now break up collar-elbow tie-ups when the wrestlers are holding each other at the corner for too long. The Reversal Limit system was introduced to prevent players from constantly reversing moves throughout the match; they come as minor and major ones depending on the class of the wrestler. This method can be toggled on/off in the Options section.WWE 2K17 retained the control scheme from the previous title while implementing two styles of submissions. Ladders can now be used in other methods, new OMG moments were added to the game, and a new mini-game involving the Money in the Bank briefcase changed the aesthetics to ladder matches.WWE 2K18 re-worked the carrying system. Top rope moves such as elbow drops are now performed faster, and attack animations were massively improved. 2K18 also added new corner finishers, such as Randy Orton's Corner RKO and John Cena's Corner AA.WWE 2K19 introduced the Payback engine, which gives advantages to players who are losing a match. These advantages include an automatic reversal, spraying green mist to blind your opponent, or storing one or multiple finishers.WWE 2K20 changed the controls to be more precise and simple for new players, yet easy to understand and adapt to for veterans. Paybacks made their return, and new versions of paybacks were introduced.WWE 2K22 adds blocking and dodging while R2/RT in combination of the four action buttons is used for payback submission finisher or signature.\n\n\n=== Story modes ===\nIn the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series, the player was able to choose a \"superstar\" from a roster and compete in an arcade-like feature called season mode. In season mode, players direct their superstars through different career obstacles through a year of WWE programming to gain respect with other superstars and popularity among the fans. Like superstars from WWE, the superstars in the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw series season mode are involved in storylines that affect their career mode in some way. Beginning with the release of WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, the WWE Brand Extension has been included in season mode, and superstars are exclusive to one brand of WWE. A result of this feature is that the player's superstar may only wrestle superstars and compete for championships from the same brand on which he is a part of. In season mode, the player's superstar has the ability to earn and wrestle for a variety of championships based on actual WWE Championships. When superstars win championships, their respect and popularity increase, which also increases their involvement in main event matches. As the superstar's respect and popularity increases through the year of WWE programming, it becomes more likely for the player to achieve the main goal in season mode, which is to earn a World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania, the WWE's flagship pay-per-view event and the final stage in season mode. After the final stage, season modes begins again with the same superstar chosen before, though the player has the option of switching superstars. The superstar is then a part of the WWE Draft Lottery and is assigned to a brand.Season mode was replaced with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The difference is that each storyline is tailor-made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.Road to WrestleMania was replaced with Attitude Era Mode in WWE '13. This single-player mode is an abridged recreation of a memorable time in sports entertainment, allowing players to journey through various storylines as eight of the most popular superstars of that time, including \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. The chapter-based saga moves through WWE's struggle and eventual triumph during the \"Monday Night Wars,\" which saw the company on the brink of defeat at the hands of a powerful rival, WCW. Told from the perspective of the WWE during that period, matches and in-game cutscenes are supplemented by video packages assembled by WWE's own editors.In WWE 2K14, a single player campaign titled \"The 30 Years of WrestleMania\" was introduced, a nostalgic gameplay mode that recreates nearly three decades of WWE history, including 46 matches, classic WWE footage and many legendary characters. The mode features a distinct roster of wrestlers and alternate gimmicks, who wrestled at WrestleMania. In this mode matches have primary objectives, required to beat the game, and bonus historical objectives, which result in recreated WrestleMania moments. Sometimes the player must follow a guided sequence of inputs, rather than freely control the character. The player competes through storylines of various lengths, switching predetermined characters as they are completed. Each chapter has its own title and focus; \"Hulkamania Runs Wild\" focuses on Hulk Hogan and early WrestleManias, while \"The New Generation\" showcases the rise of Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels in the mid-1990s. The \"Attitude Era\" chapter brings back some matches from WWE '13's \"Attitude Era\" mode, as well as some not covered before. The \"Ruthless Aggression\" chapter focuses on the departure of The Rock, lessened focus on Triple H and rise of Randy Orton and Edge. The final \"Universe Era\" chapter focuses on the rise of John Cena and the returns of The Rock and Brock Lesnar.WWE 2K15 features the 2K Showcase, the core stories include CM Punk vs. John Cena and Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels. These rivalries detail from 2002 to 2004 (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and 2011 to 2013 (CM Punk and John Cena). Three other stories which were included as DLC include The Path of the Warrior, a highlight behind the life of The Ultimate Warrior and his meteoric rise concentrating on championships to the Hall of Fame as commemoration. The Hall of Pain, a story behind the World's Strongest Man, Mark Henry as he punished many to become the World Heavyweight Champion and attempts to gain the WWE Championship. Lastly, the One More Match story stars Christian, as he complained about having one more match as his way of getting multiple second chances of earning the World Heavyweight Championship. Originally, these stories were meant to be produced for WWE '12, WWE '13 & WWE 2K14, but the developers chose to use WWE '12 for Road to Wrestlemania, the Attitude Era for WWE '13 and 30 years of WrestleMania for WWE 2K14.WWE 2K16 details the historical career of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, from his days in ECW, when he was angry that things were not going to happen in a good sense for him, to WCW, when he and Brian Pillman began to become The Hollywood Blonds leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti-hero that was not going to be tame into a corporate man. Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from WWE '13 and WWE 2K14 with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.WWE 2K17 discontinued the 2K Showcase Mode for the physical disc version but later made one for the 2016 Hall of Fame. In the 2016 Hall of Fame 2K Showcase, seven matches have been announced. Cactus Jack & Diamond Dallas Page vs. The Fabulous Freebirds (Jimmy Garvin & Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes) (WCW Saturday Night 1992), The Fabulous Freebirds (Buddy Roberts & Michael \"P.S.\" Hayes) vs. Kerry & Kevin Von Erich (WCCW 1986), Ivory vs. Jacqueline (SmackDown! 2000), Sting (gold and black tights) vs. Ric Flair (Clash of the Champions 1988),  Sting (n.W.o. Wolfpac ring gear) vs. Bret Hart (WCW Halloween Havoc 1998), Papa Shango vs. The Godfather (Dream Match) and Big Boss Man (with Albert) vs. Big Show (Armageddon 1999).WWE 2K18 terminated the showcase mode.WWE 2K19 reinstates the 2K Showcase entitled The Return of Daniel Bryan, a comprehensive experience through the narration of Daniel Bryan and the player has to complete 11 missions and a what if match from Daniel's time in Velocity to WrestleMania 34.WWE 2K20 focuses on the story of the Four Horsewomen of WWE (Becky Lynch, Bayley, Sasha Banks and Charlotte Flair) and their iconic matches from NXT up to WrestleMania 35.WWE 2K22 reinstates the 2K Showcase now based on Rey Mysterio\n\n\n=== General Manager Mode ===\nStarting with WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006, a General Manager mode (or GM Mode for short) was introduced. It allows the player to act as the General Manager of the Raw or SmackDown brands (or ECW in WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008). After choosing a brand, and selecting to participate in the WWE Draft, or using a default roster, players then start a calendar year of hiring and managing Superstars and Divas, booking matches, establishing rivalries, and other options to try and win WWE fans to support your brand. Players must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to make better matches than their rival brands. At the end of the year at WrestleMania, Vince McMahon will give The General Manager of the Year award to the show that was able to hold the most fans.In WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008, GM Mode was combined into one game mode called WWE 24/7 Mode. This basically allowed Superstars to train, make special appearances or other actions between matches during full calendar years. After achieving specific goals through the game, a percentage will increase of becoming a WWE Hall of Famer / General Manager of the Year winner, and the mode does not end until this percentage reaches 100%.This mode was discontinued in WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2009.In WWE 2K22, this mode is rechristened as MyGM.\n\n\n=== Universe mode ===\nThe series has had a \"WWE Universe\" mode since SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 which replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match. In WWE '12, championships was not able to be toggled on and off from most wrestlers. WWE '13 introduced the option to toggle on and off rivalries injuries and tag team changes also crowd reactions. WWE 2K14 was the last title to use the method of created arena before it was removed in WWE 2K15. In WWE 2K15, secret hints had to be unlocked through actions in this mode; there were 300 to collect. WWE 2K16 allows wrestlers to be branded by multiple promotions. WWE 2K17 replicates real television with a promo engine. WWE 2K18 has remade Universe Mode from scratch as a new goal system is put in place and draft system has been removed as player can reshuffle them. In WWE 2K19, Money in the Bank options are expanded to Mid-Match, Pre-Match or Post Match cash ins; also, the player can also switch control of the superstar once pausing the game. WWE 2k20 introduces more matches on the card add/delete promos and more rivalries encountering than before.In WWE 2K22, a win-lost record is displayed on screen as this is indicating that features from No Mercy were the spark of inspiration for this version of Universe Mode.\n\n\n=== 2K Towers ===\nThis game mode was introduced in WWE 2K19, Gauntlet and Step type towers and a Million Dollar Challenge were many that debuted. In WWE 2K20, the game mode returns, though there is one tower entitled \"Roman's Reign\" using narrative commentary from Roman Reigns on his matches from Extreme Rules 2013 to Stomping Grounds in 2019.\n\n\n=== MyCareer Mode ===\nThis mode was introduced in WWE 2K15, social media followers were counted for the WWE Universe liking the player (the number of followers can decrease if bad performances occur during matches); pre-set cutscenes that used to be created for Story Mode in WWE '12 to WWE 2K14 appear at random times. In WWE 2K16, the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). WWE 2K17 brings in a promo engine and every action can trigger a backstage brawl depending on what answer the created superstar gives. WWE 2K18 continues with the promo engine from 2K17 with free roaming now a central focus. In WWE 2K19, the MyCareer Mode features a story of a created superstar helping a brand named BCW (owned and operated by Barron Blade, who debuted in WWE 2K15), the character faces many obstacles caused by The Authority in his quest to be the WWE Universal Champion. For the first time ever, the MyCareer Characters are playable for Exhibition and Universe mode. In WWE 2K20, male and female characters can fight together via Mixed Match Challenge features to progress in the MyCareer mode.in WWE 2K22, this mode is repackaged as MyRise\n\n\n=== Exhibition mode ===\n\nOther than the season mode, every game features an exhibition mode, where different professional wrestling match types are available. Basic matches included in every game are \"one-on-one\" matches, where a player chooses one superstar to wrestle another bot operated or human operated superstar, or tag team matches, where a pair of superstars team together to face another team, Mixed Gender Tag Team matches have been removed in WWE 2K18. These basic matches may also expand into six-man tag team matches or non-elimination type matches, which include four or more superstars. Besides basic matches, hardcore based matches are also included, such as the Steel Cage match, which has been included in every game, the Ladder match, the Elimination Chamber, which was first included with the release of WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, and ECW Extreme Rules matches, which is basic hardcore wrestling based on the ECW brand of WWE (which first appeared with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008). Also included in every game is the Royal Rumble match, which is based on WWE's actual Royal Rumble match, in which a player chooses to compete as one superstar, and must wrestle against twenty-nine other superstars. Two recently added matches are the Championship Scramble introduced in the 2010 game and the \"I Quit\" match from WWE '13. In WWE '13 the 'special referee' match type (which hadn't been seen since Smackdown vs. Raw 2007) made its return to the series. The exhibition mode was renamed \"Play\" in SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 to WWE 2K14 and renamed Exhibition in WWE 2K15 before returning as Play mode in WWE 2K16. In the PS3 & Xbox 360's version of WWE 2K17, Play Mode is required to unlock content from characters. attires, & championship belts (Arenas are unlocked from WWE Universe Mode after collecting 300 + stories or more). WWE 2K18 introduces 8 man matches a new version of Elimination Chamber and a re-worked version of the Royal Rumble match. In WWE 2K19, multi-man matches such as Fatal Five Way and Triple Threat Matches are also more prevalent in match types; Big Head Mode is an option that can be toggled on and off. WWE 2K20 introduces the Mixed Match Challenge as a new match type involving team specific factions and certain ones who have tag team finishers yet to be announced.\n\n\n=== Online gameplay ===\nStarting with the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online gameplay was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard disk drive into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature. In WWE 2K19, 2k Towers have been introduced for offline and online (some implemented to assist Road to Glory mode); the Wyatt Compound is used in a backstage brawl match (this is also an integral area in the MyCareer Mode). In WWE 2K20, Lobbies return with quick matchmaking and more responsiveness for Road to Glory mode.\n\n\n=== Roster ===\nEvery game in the WWE series includes a roster of \"superstars\" and \"Divas\" based on superstars who compete for WWE. Every year, WWE acquires new superstars and releases old superstars. As a result, every time a WWE SmackDown vs. Raw game is released, the new superstars are added into the game and the old released superstars are removed from the game to reflect the changes in the actual WWE. From the release of WWF SmackDown! to the release of WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, superstars were not divided into brands. In 2002, the WWE split its entire roster into two brands of wrestling, called Raw and SmackDown!, which were named after WWE's television shows. The WWE Brand Extension was first featured in WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth. In 2006, WWE launched a new brand, called ECW, which was named after the original Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion. The new ECW brand was first featured in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008. WWE holds an annual draft lottery, in which WWE superstars switch brands. The games in production when the draft occurs include the changes that take place in the draft. For example, when WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 was in production during June 2007, the 2007 WWE Draft took place, and the draft changes were included in the video game. Another brand of wrestling included in the series is the legends program, which was first included with the release of WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain. Popular WWE alumni or members of the WWE Hall of Fame have been included since then under the legends program. This was featured up until the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008, as alumni and Hall of Fame members were not featured in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 due to production of WWE Legends of WrestleMania. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 was also the first game to feature characters as downloadable content.WWE '12 has 56 wrestlers and 78 by DLC, WWE '13 with 84 and 107 by DLC, WWE 2K14 with 82 and 103 by DLC, WWE 2K15 with 76 and 113 with DLC, WWE 2K16 with 133 including DLC giving this title \"the highest character roster in the video game's history\" with 165. WWE 2K17 carries 145 for the physical disc versions for PS3 and Xbox 360; 150 for the NXT Edition made for PS4 and Xbox One with DLC at 172. WWE 2K18 contains 197 for the standard version (202 via Deluxe and Collector's Edition) with DLC announced at a later date. An update on the WWE 2K18 roster revealed on September 25, 2017, the final roster is 220 (197 on disc virtually reading 204 by attires counted). WWE 2K19 has 217 characters on disc (224 via Woo Edition) and 236 with DLC counted as final. WWE 2K20 has 217 characters on disc (221 via SmackDown 20th Anniversary Edition) with DLC yet to be finalized.WWE 2K22 is confirmed to retain majority of the 2k20 characters including some released from WWE itself in effort to outdo 2K20.\n\n\n=== Create mode ===\n\nThe series features a create-a-superstar mode, where players are able to create their own wrestler, including their move set and ring entrances. The feature was introduced when WWF SmackDown! was released in 2000. As new games were released, the mode was altered; the first change came with the release of WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role, which featured a mode in which wrestler taunts could be created and customized. This was further modified in WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth, which enabled players to create the walking style of a wrestler. With the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006, the game first featured the ability for players to make an entrance for the created superstar. The feature was expanded with the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007, as players could place pyrotechnics and special effects in any part of the superstar's entrance.\nAs an addition to SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, a create a finisher mode was introduced where the player chooses up to 10 out of 500 animations combined to make their own personalised finisher. The create a finisher feature was removed on next-gen consoles, starting with WWE 2K15. On the 360 and PS3 versions of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010, it is possible to change the colors of a featured superstar's attire, this new mode is known as \"Superstar Threads\". In this game, there is also a new creation mode giving players the ability to create their designs.From WWE 2K14 alongside the \"Superstar Threads\" feature, in the \"Create a Superstar\" mode there was a new part of it called \"Superstar Heads\". This feature allowed players to take certain in game models and modify or create a new attire for that model and use it as an alternative attire for the superstar that they have done it for. This was only available for very limited superstars and players couldn't any headgear or masks to the superstar. A DLC was soon released which featured vintage versions of some of the existing models as well as few new models.From WWE 2K15, on next generation consoles a new feature was available to players which was similar to the \"Superstar Heads\" feature that had previously featured on WWE games but this new feature was called the \"Superstar Studio\". This new \"Superstar Studio\" allowed players to take any existing in game model and modify their attires into anything that the player desired. Whilst this was exclusive to next generation consoles, players playing on last-gen consoles had the returning \"Superstar Heads\" mode which featured all of the models from 2K14 as well as a new Brock Lesnar model. WWE 2K17 brings back Highlight Replay and Create-A-Victory features from WWE '13 and SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain respectively. WWE 2K18 introduces Create-A-Match where players can save changes and use them in Play Mode.WWE 2K22 introduces 4 different classes of superstars to make.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe original WWF SmackDown! was one of the most popular games for the PlayStation console in 2000, selling over 975,000 units for the PlayStation, and selling over one million copies in the United States. The game lost appeal due to the failing of a well-established season mode that was deemed \"disappointing.\" The season mode was criticized for the lack of in-depth storylines and the way superstars spoke in season mode, through \"putrid lines\" and \"blocked text.\"WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role received a better reception than the first WWE SmackDown game, as IGN stated that season mode \"actually works properly\", though the audio of the game was lacking as there was no commentary, and only generic music was included in the game. WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, according to IGN, did little to improve the season mode of the game, while GameSpot stated that the addition of audio commentary detracted from the playing experience. By 2003, the series had sold more than 4.7 million units for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 in the United States.WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth and WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain received more positive reviews from both IGN and GameSpot, both of whom cited the expanded season mode as an improvement, although flaws were still visible in the mode. It improved from the previous three WWF SmackDown! games, as it was written by actual WWE storyline writers. Both games also featured generic music, though the quality of it had improved. Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain.WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was \"a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, and lots of other bells and whistles that make the whole package shine.\"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode.WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 received positive reviews upon release. According to video game review aggregator Metacritic, WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 received favorable reviews on all platforms. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of one eight and three sevens for the Xbox 360 version, and one five, one seven and two sixes for the PSP version. The game received praise for presentation and the high amount of content, but was criticized for glitches, including commentary and ring announcing problems, and collision detection issues, with wrestlers being able to skip climbing an occupied ladder, making the Money In The Bank match extremely difficult. For example, if one wrestler is on top of the ladder, another wrestler may suddenly superplex him, without even climbing the ladder.WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 received more negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the \"Ultimate Control moves,\" \"Struggle system,\" and the ECW Extreme Rules matches.WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009 was rated 31st and 28th (Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, respectively) in IGN's \"Top 100 Games\" list. It is among the best-selling video game franchises, with 60 million copies shipped as of 2013.WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010 was met with mostly positive reception from numerous video game publications. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 81.29% and 80 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 80.60% and 81 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 79% and 78 out of 100 for the Wii version; 76% and 76 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 73.29% and 75 out of 100 for the DS version; 71% and 71 out of 100 for the PSP version; and 48.33% and 42 out of 100 for the iOS version.WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 was met with positive to mixed reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 80% and 80 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 77.47% and 74 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 76.84% and 75 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 74% and 72 out of 100 for the Wii version; and 60% and 62 out of 100 for the PSP version. Greg Miller of IGN gave the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game an eight out of ten. He praised the game's Universe Mode and the wrestler animations, but criticized the limitations of Road to WrestleMania mode and the inaccurate commentary. In addition, he stated that the grappling system could be \"frustrating at times.\" Miller gave the Wii version of the game a 7.5 out of ten, however. He mentioned the same criticisms from the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, but also criticized the graphics. GameSpot's Chris Watters rated the PS3 and X360 versions seven out of ten, lauding the game's customization options, while finding fault with the game's collision detection and the lag during online multiplayer games. He also claimed that the series was starting to \"show its age.\" The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of WWE '12 garnered mixed reviews. IGN gave the game a 9.0 out of 10, stating that the gameplay changes are \"breathing new life into its core mechanics\". Mike D'Alonzo of G4 called it \"the best wrestling game ever made\". However, Andy Hartup of Computer and Video Games gave the game a 6.7 out of 10 and wrote that the game, \"offers little more than some new gloss painted over an old product\". Game Informer's Dan Ryckert echoed the sentiment, stating, \"Thanks to a severely downgraded story mode and a lack of substantial improvements, this is the weakest WWE title in years.\"\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",
    "Vincenzo Monti": "Vincenzo Monti (19 February 1754 \u2013 13 October 1828) was an Italian poet, playwright, translator, and scholar, the greatest interpreter of Italian neoclassicism in all of its various phases. His verse translation of the Iliad is considered one of the greatest of them all, with its iconic opening (\"Cantami, o Diva, del Pelide Achille,/L'ira funesta[...]\", lib. I, verses 1-2) becoming an extremely recognizable phrase among Italians (for example, being the text shown when opening a font file in Microsoft Windows).\n\n\n== Biography ==\nMonti was born in Alfonsine, Province of Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna the son of Fedele and Domenica Maria Mazzari, landowners.  He was educated at the seminar in Faenza and at the University of Ferrara, where he studied medicine and\njurisprudence.\n\n\n== Chronology ==\n\nIn 1775 he is admitted to membership in the Academy of Arcadians and the next year his first book is published: \"La visione di Ezechiello\" (\"Ezekiel's vision\").\nIn 1778 Monti moves to Rome, invited there by cardinal and papal legate in Ferrara, Scipione Borghese. He marries Teresa Pichler who bears him a daughter, Costanza,\nand a son, Francesco (the latter dies at only two years old). Through her the singer Fanny Eckerlin is his niece.He published in 1785 his tragedy of \"Aristodemo,\" which was received with great favour. His poem entitled \"Bassvilliana,\" (1793), suggested by the murder of Nicolas Jean Hugou de Basseville, envoy of the French Republic at Rome, had also great popularity, and passed through eighteen editions in six months.\nIn 1797 he leaves Rome and, after visiting Bologna and Venice, finally settles in Milan, forsaking his former opposition to the French Revolution (expressed in the \"Bassvilliana\") and becoming a supporter of the newborn Cisalpine Republic.\nIn 1799, he is forced to leave the city when the French are defeated, but it takes him only two years to come back, following the Battle of Marengo (1800).\nWhile in Paris, Monti devotes more and more of his time to translations from French and Latin, which today are considered to be his best works: he publishes \"La Pucelle d'Orleans\" by Voltaire, soon to be followed by the \"Satire\" by Persius and the \"Iliade\" (Iliad) by Homer.\nSoon after his return, Monti published his tragedy of \"Caio Gracco,\" \"La Mascheroniana,\" a poem on the death of his friend Lorenzo Mascheroni, and his beautiful and popular hymn beginning \"Bell'Italia,\" etc. Monti became in 1803 professor of eloquence at Pavia, and on the coronation of Napoleon, in 1805, was appointed his historiographer. He filled this office rather as court poet than historian, and lavished a profusion of eulogistic verses on the emperor and his family. He was created by him a chevalier of the Legion of Honour and of the Iron Crown, and was chosen a member of the Institute of the Kingdom of Italy.After the fall of Napoleon in 1815, Monti tries to win back the Austrian regime with his last poems \"Il mistico omaggio\" and \"Il ritorno di Astrea\", before committing to the development of Italian linguistics during his last years.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nMany authors have given different opinions about the poet's value. Two factors are generally agreed upon, but they are given different weight yielding a more or less favourable judgement: the lack of ideals and authenticity, and the superior technical skills.\nIn the fast-changing political scenario of his time, Monti appears not to live up to his ideals: he is blamed from the political point of view for being first an opposer to the French revolution, then an open supporter of Napoleon, then eventually a supporter of the Austrian Empire. Furthermore, he is accused of expressing insincere feelings in his works and of only caring about the formal aspects of his productions.\nIn a time of strong political ideals such as the \"Risorgimento\" and strong interior passions such as Romanticism, famous representatives of\nItalian literature such as Ugo Foscolo and Giacomo Leopardi pointed to these as unforgivable flaws, whereas in their opinion a poet should never give up his beliefs in exchange for practical advantages, and should prefer a worthy content over a much refined literary technique.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n1776 \u2013 \"La visione di Ezechiello\"\n1779 \u2013 \"Prosopopea di Pericle\" (ode) and  \"Saggio di poesie\"\n1781 \u2013 \"La bellezza dell'universo\" (short poem)\n1782 \u2013 \"Sciolti a Sigismondo Chigi\" and \"Pensieri d'amore\"\n1783 \u2013 \"Versi\"\n1784 \u2013 \"Al signor di Montgolfier\" (ode)\n1787 \u2013 \"Aristodemo\" (tragedy)\n1788 \u2013 \"Galeotto Manfredi\"\n1793 \u2013 \"Bassvilliana\"/\"In morte di Ugo di Bassville\" (left unfinished)\n1797 \u2013 \"La Musogonia\" and \"Prometeo\"\n1800 \u2013 \"Poesie\", \"Dopo la battaglia di Marengo\", and translation of Voltaire's \"La Pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans\" -> \"La pulcella d'Orleans\"\n1802 \u2013 \"Mascheroniana\"/\"In morte di Lorenzo Mascheroni\" (poem) and \"Caio Gracco\" (tragedy)\n1803 \u2013 translation: \"Satire\" (Persius)\n1805 \u2013 \"Alla maest\u00e0 di Napoleone\"\n1806 \u2013 \"Il bardo della Selva Nera\", translated into French by Jacques-Marie Deschamps (le Barde de la For\u00eat-Noire, 1807)\n1810 \u2013 translation: \"Iliade\" (Homer)\n1815 \u2013 \"Il mistico omaggio\"\n1816 \u2013 \"Il ritorno di Astrea\"\n1825 \u2013 \"Sulla mitologia\"\n1817\u20131826 \u2013 \"Proposta di alcune correzioni ed aggiunte al Vocabolario della Crusca\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGuido Bustico: Bibliografia di Vincenzo Monti.

    "Gouache (album)": "Gouache is a 2012 studio album by jazz pianist and composer Jacky Terrasson. The vocalist C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant appears on two tracks. The album was released in Europe by Universal and in the U.S. by Sunnyside the following year.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nMatt Collar reviewed the album for Allmusic and described it as \"eclectic, playful, and often beautiful\" highlighting the \"ruminative version\" of John Lennon's \"Oh My Love\" and the \"positively swoon-inducing\" \"Je te veux\" in which C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant \"draws upon the languid, bittersweet influence of Billie Holiday, while always keeping a smile in her voice\".  Collar concluded that \"Terrasson's original compositions reveal a passion for melody and groove, paired with an adventurous, flowing, stream-of-consciousness post-bop aesthetic that ultimately makes Gouache a pure joy to hear\". PopMatters 's review by Steve Horowitz observed, \"Like the watercolor from which the song gets its name, the album\u2019s musical palette is rich with colors and blendings. The surface beauty only deepens the expressiveness of Terrasson\u2019s work.\"Reviewing the album for JazzTimes, Thomas Conrad felt that Terrasson \"...should be ready to make an important record, but Gouache is not one. It is more a sampler of party music than an album statement. Guests come and go. It is also Terrasson's most extended flirtation with pop culture\". Conrad noted that the \"prancing groove\" of \"Rehab\" is \"interrupted by ominous crashes\" and highlighted trumpeter Stephane Belmondo's contribution on \"Mother\". Conrad felt that the pieces involving Terrasson's trio were best, describing \"Happiness\" as Terrasson's \"sweet spot...a depiction of ecstasy through unleashed energy and spilling ideas\" and that \"C'est si bon\"'s \"wild headlong bouncing ride is quintessential Terrasson: entertaining, extravagant, skillful, more from the head than the heart\".Dave Gelly reviewed Gouache for The Guardian and wrote that Terrasson was \"a pianist of such extravagant talents that it sometimes seems he can't decide what to do with them. There have been occasions when his phenomenal technique swamped everything else, but they are getting fewer as the years pass. He creates some truly touching and delicate moments here, in particular a version of Erik Satie's Je te veux, with vocalist C\u00e9cile McLorin Salvant, and a quietly disturbing treatment of Amy Winehouse's Rehab. The authentic Terrasson fireworks still get a good showing among these 10 pieces, though, especially in his own, aptly titled Try to Catch Me\".\"Baby\" was described by reviewers both as a \"jaunty sleigh ride of song, with a euphoric '70s R&B ballad midsection\" and as \"vacuous a ditty as you've ever sat still for\" that Terrasson \"speeds...to a blur on acoustic piano and hammers it on Fender Rhodes.

    "Abandoned mine drainage": "Abandoned mine drainage (also known as AMD) is a form of water pollution involving water that has been polluted by contact with mines, typically coal mines. Although it is sometimes called \"acid mine drainage\", not all abandoned mine drainage is acidic.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThe most common form of abandoned mine drainage is acid mine drainage, which is highly acidic water coming from mines. Abandoned mine drainage can become acidic when it is exposed to oxygen and sulfur-containing minerals such as pyrite.Another form of abandoned mine drainage is alkaline mine drainage. This typically occurs in the presence of minerals such as calcite, limestone, or dolomite. The third form of abandoned mine drainage is metal mine drainage, which occurs when large amounts of metals such as lead contaminate mine water.\n\n\n== Geochemistry ==\nThe precise chemistry of abandoned mine drainage discharges typically varies. Abandoned mine drainage typically originates in surface mines, deep mines, and \"gob piles\".Abandoned mine drainage typically has high concentrations of metals and total dissolved solids. Iron is the most common metal in abandoned mine drainage, but aluminum and manganese occur as well. It may also have a high water temperature and an altered pH, though the characteristics of abandoned mine drainage depend heavily on the area's geochemistry. Other signs of abandoned mine drainage include high sulfate levels and siltation. Acid mine drainage has a pH of less than 7, while alkaline mine drainage has a pH of greater than 7.The concentrations of metals in abandoned mine drainage can range from several to several thousand parts per million. In Pennsylvania's Coal Region, it has an iron concentration of less than 100 milligrams per liter (0.100 oz/cu ft) and a pH of close to 7.Abandoned mine drainage can cause affected streams to take on a bright orange color.\n\n\n== Environmental effects ==\nAbandoned mine drainage affects streams worldwide. A 2017 United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) report documented \"widespread destruction\" from mining waste that is released into the environment as a result of dam failures.Mine drainage is prevalent in the United States state of Pennsylvania, as well as several other states that have historically had large mining industries. In Pennsylvania, nearly 2,500 miles (4,000 km) of streams have been affected by abandoned mine drainage, and more than 7,500 miles (12,100 km) have been affected in the Appalachian Mountains, and more than 10,000 miles (16,000 km) are affected in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.In one watershed affected by abandoned mine drainage, the value of homes within 200 feet (61 m) of an affected stream decreased by $2500 per 1 acre (0.40 ha), as of 2009.Algae sometimes coat streams that are affected by abandoned mine drainage, although aquatic plants have difficulty surviving in such streams. The gills of fish are also harmed by the metals in abandoned mine drainage. The eggs of macroinvertebrates and fish are also smothered by the precipitate. Coldwater fish such as trout are especially harmed by abandoned mine drainage.Abandoned mine drainage also affects the plants and animals in the area surrounding the mine. Mine drainage pollution has been found in sheep that fed near abandoned mines. \n\n\n== Remedies and applications ==\nThere are several methods by which abandoned mine drainage can be remedied: passive treatment, active treatment, and land reclamation. Trompes may also be useful in treating abandoned mine drainage.The natural gas industry has suggested using abandoned mine drainage water in hydraulic fracturing. Proponents of this idea say that it would remove toxic water from the environment while reducing the natural gas industry's need to use water from streams and rivers. However, opponents have said that it would \"make a dirty process even dirtier\". This has already been done with streams such as an unnamed tributary to Johnson Creek. Abandoned mine drainage solids have shown potential in capturing mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.The iron oxide generated by treating abandoned mine drainage can be used as a glaze for pottery.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAbandoned mine drainage on PubMed",

He was immediately called by the match referee after the match was over. There Afridi pleaded guilty to ball tampering and he was banned from two Twenty20 Internationals.During the Twenty20 International, Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait bowled the fastest delivery ever recorded in Australia (160.7 km/h). Tait achieved the feat on the second ball of his first over. It is also the third fastest delivery ever recorded behind Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar.Australia registered a clean sweep by winning the Test series 3\u20130, the ODI series 5-0 and the only T20.\nDuring the tour, speculation was rife that captain Mohammad Yousuf was involved in a power struggle with former skippers Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik and that team morale was low.\nFollowing the tour, the Pakistan Cricket Board conducted an inquiry and announced that Yousuf and Younis would not be selected for the country in future, implying a life exclusion, and banned Malik and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan for a year each. Afridi and the brothers Umar and Kamran Akmal were all fined and put on probation for six months. Kamran had been dropped after the second Test because of a string of dropped catches, but spoke out against the decision and insisted that he was not dropped, while Umar was accused of disruption by feigning injury in an attempt to go on strike in solidarity.\n\n\n== Squads ==\n\n\n== Tour matches ==\n\n\n=== 3-day tour match: Tasmania v Pakistanis - 19\u201321 December ===\n\n\n== Test series ==\n\n\n=== 1st Test ===\n\n\n=== 2nd Test ===\n\nAt an inquiry after the series was completed, the management of the Pakistan team testified that they suspected that some of the Pakistan team conspired with bookmakers in match-fixing events during this match. Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal missed four catches and a run-out in the Australian second innings as Australia turned around a substantial first innings deficit to win the Test. However, the Australian captain Michael Clarke stated that he \"certainly had no suspicions\". Several months later, Mazhar Majeed a man who had accepted a bribe to provide information about spot-fixing during Pakistan's summer tour of England, stated that the match had been fixed and that the fixers had made more than a million pounds as a result of Pakistan's loss from a commanding position.

    "Duk-Duk": "Duk-Duk is a secret society, part of the traditional culture of the Tolai people of the Rabaul area of New Britain, the largest island in the Bismarck Archipelago of Papua New Guinea, in the South Pacific. \n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe society has religious and political as well as social objectives. It represents a form of law and order through its presiding spirits. In ritual dances, members of the society invoke the male spirit duk duk and female spirit tubuan depending on which mask the dancer wears. The dancers are always male despite the fact that some are performing the role of female spirits.  Women and children were forbidden to look at these figures.  Both types of mask are cone-shaped and are constructed of cane and fibre, with short, bushy capes of leaves. Traditionally the duk duk was taller than the tubuan and was faceless. The tubuan had circular eyes and a crescent-shaped mouth painted on a dark background. In addition to the mask, leaves cover the torso of the dancers so that only their legs are visible.Only males could belong to Duk-Duk, with an entrance fee (in dewarra, small cowry shells strung on strips of cane, often 100 metres or more).\nThe society has its secret signs and rituals, and festivals which were in past times closed to strangers on pain of death. Duk-Duk only appeared with the full moon.Justice was executed, fines extorted, taboos, feasts, taxes and all tribal matters arranged by the Duk-Duk members, wearing  masks or chalk on their faces. In carrying out punishments, they were allowed to burn houses and even kill people. Dancers wearing the tubuan masks were regarded as divine beings whose judgment and actions could not be questioned.The society's practice has been dying out since around the start of the 20th century, but Duk-Duk dancers are now featured as tourist attraction.\n\n\n== Sources and references ==\n\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

    "Sven Rydenfelt": "Sven Rydenfelt (23 January 1911 \u2013 15 February 2005) was a Swedish economist and political writer known for his libertarian views.\nSven Rydenfelt was born in Hj\u00e4rnarp, \u00c4ngelholm Municipality, Sweden. He became politically active during the 1940s when he started to write for several newspapers and journals. In 1945 he became the first chairman of the Liberal Student Association (affiliated with the social liberal People's Party) in Lund. Within the People's Party, Rydenfelt was considered as a rising young man and a possible candidate as Member of Parliament. However, due to a conflict with then party leader Bertil Ohlin over the party's stance on value added tax (which Rydenfelt opposed and Ohlin supported), Rydenfelt was forced to leave the party. During the 1950s he came to work for the Moderate Party instead. Among other things, he authored the party's program on housing policy. However, due to his strong support for the free market he was still considered too controversial by some.\nRydenfelt predicted already in 1956 the future collapse of the Soviet Union. In an article in the journal Samtid och Framtid (no.5/1956) he wrote: \"Some argue that only a third world war could bring the Soviet Empire to an end. An inconsolable thought. If merely we have patience, it will crack from within, and through its gravel and ashes a new and more free Russia will rise\".\nIn 1956, Rydenfelt was elected to the Mont Pelerin Society where he learned to know people like Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman who came to influence much of his political thinking. During the 1960s he continued his criticism of what he saw as the overregulated Swedish economy. In 1966 he authored the book S\u00e4kerhetspolisens hemliga register \u2013 om \u00e5siktsfrihet och \u00e5siktsf\u00f6rf\u00f6ljelse (\"The Secret Registry of the Security Service \u2013 On Freedom of Opinion And Political Persecution\") together with Janerik Larsson. This book led the Swedish Security Service to classify him as a \"dangerous leftist activist\" (Swedish: samh\u00e4llsfarlig v\u00e4nsteraktivist).\nIt was first during the 1970s and 1980s that Rydenfelt's work and ideas was to be recognized in Sweden, and he became something of an icon among young Swedish conservatives and neoliberals. Due to his, for the Swedish political establishment, controversial opinions, he wasn't given a professorship until 1991, when the ministry of Carl Bildt took office. However, Rydenfelt continued to criticize both the Social Democrats as well as the non-socialist parties.\nTowards the end of his life, Rydenfelt was a member of the editorial board of the journal Nyliberalen (\"The Neoliberal\"). He was also critical of the European Union and was an honorary member of Citizens Against EMU (Swedish: Medborgare mot EMU), the main non-socialist organization which campaigned against Sweden's adoption of the euro during the referendum in 2003.\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDen svenska bostadskrisen : hur hyresregleringen skapar bostadsbrist (in Swedish).

Apart from The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland published in 1845, it has not been superseded. The first edition is available online. A second edition was published in 1842.\nIn the 1837 preface, the editor noted that:\n\nThe numerous county histories, and local descriptions of cities, towns, and districts of England and Wales, rendered the publication of their former works, in comparison with the present, an easy task. The extreme paucity of such works, in relation to Ireland, imposed the necessity of greater assiduity in the personal survey, and proportionately increased the expense.\nLewis relied on the information provided by local contributors and on the earlier works published such as Coote's Statistical Survey (1801), Taylor and Skinner's Maps of the Road of Ireland (1777), Pigot's Trade Directory (1824) and other sources. He also used the various parliamentary reports and in particular the census of 1831 and the education returns of the 1820s and early 1830s. Local contributors were given the proof sheets for final comment and revision. The names of places are those in use prior to the publication of the Ordnance Survey Atlas in 1838.

    "William Fletcher Shaw": "Sir William Fletcher Shaw  (13 April 1878 \u2013 14 November 1961) was an English obstetric physician and gynaecologist who was most notable along with William Blair-Bell for creating the British College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (BCOG). He was Emeritus Professor of Obstetric and Gynaecology at the University of Manchester.\n\n\n== Life ==\nShaw was the son of David Shaw who was employed as an industrial chemist and Zilliah Shaw N\u00e9e Fletcher who was the daughter of William Fletcher, who ran a firm that manufactured wool in Littleborough, Greater Manchester area. Shaw was educated at both Owens College and Manchester Grammar School before going on matriculate at the Victoria University of Manchester to study Medicine. While at university, Shaw was the president of the Students' Union and the debating society. Shaw graduated MB, ChB in 1903.Shaw was married twice. The first time he married was on 9 December 1920 to Nora n\u00e9e Jones, who was from Manchester and had two sons. Nora Shaw died in 1934. Shaw's first son became a physician with the same speciality as his father, namely Obstetrics and gynaecology. His second son was a soldier killed in Normandy in 1944. Shaw to commemorate his son, in memoriam the William Meredith Fletcher Shaw lecture was created. In 1939, he married Mabie Mary N\u00e9e Beaty who was also a widow. Shaw's second wife died in 1947.\n\n\n== Career ==\nShaw's first clinical post as a resident was at Manchester Royal Infirmary and later at the Saint Mary's Hospital for Women and Children where he was a resident surgical officer. At Saint Mary's Shaw took part in establishing a pathology laboratory. Shaw passed his Doctor of Medicine (MD) with Gold Medal in 1906, with a thesis created from research into chronic metritis. Shaw started his career in a time when medicine and technology were undergoing rapid advancement as evidenced by the unique travelling experience he underwent at the end of his exams. To hear his results, Shaw travelled to university in a horse-drawn carriage to hear the result of his final examination one day and on the next day, he travelled by an electrically-driven tram. In 1912, Shaw was elected to the honorary staff of Saint Mary's Hospital for Women and Children. During 1919, Shaw was promoted to be honorary gynaecologist at Manchester Royal Infirmary. In 1925 Shaw was promoted to professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Manchester. In 1943 he retired and became an emeritus professor.\n\n\n== Formation of the BCOG ==\nOn 25 October 1924 Shaw, while out rough shooting in the North Lancashire fells with Sir William Blair-Bell also a physician and gynaecologist. At a later meeting between, in a casual conversation, Shaw put the idea of founding a new college with a sub-speciality to Blair-Bell.\n\n\n== Awards and honours ==\nShaw won many awards during his career. In 1936, Shaw was awarded an honorary fellowship of the American College of Surgeons. In 1939 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. In 1947, Shaw was confirmed to the mastership of midwifery of the Society of Apothecaries honoris causa. In 1948 Shaw was awarded an honorary degree of Legum Doctor Queen's University Belfast.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPortraits of Sir William Fletcher Shaw at the National Portrait Gallery, London",
    "Tax horsepower": "The tax horsepower or taxable horsepower was an early system by which taxation rates for automobiles were reckoned in some European countries such as Britain, Belgium, Germany, France and Italy; some US states like Illinois charged license plate purchase and renewal fees for passenger automobiles based on taxable horsepower. The tax horsepower rating was computed not from actual engine power but by a mathematical formula based on cylinder dimensions. At the beginning of the twentieth century, tax power was reasonably close to real power; as the internal combustion engine developed, real power became larger than nominal taxable power by a factor of ten or more.\n\n\n== Britain ==\nThe so-called RAC horsepower rating was devised in 1910 by the RAC at the invitation of the British government. The formula is:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              D\n              \u00d7\n              D\n              \u00d7\n              n\n            \n            2.5\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {D\\times D\\times n}{2.5}}}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   is the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   is the number of cylindersThe formula was calculated from total piston surface area (i.e., \"bore\" only). The factor of 2.5 accounts for characteristics that were widely seen in engines at the time, such as a mean effective pressure in the cylinder of 90 psi (6.2 bar) and a maximum piston speed of 1,000 feet per minute (5.1 m/s).\nThe system introduced a somewhat progressive way of taxing higher-value cars more than low-cost ones but was also introduced to protect the domestic British motor industry from foreign imports, especially the Ford Model T. Henry Ford's mass production methods meant that the Model T was competitively priced with British-built cars despite being a much larger, more durable and more powerful car than other available similarly-priced models. In 1912 Ford opened a factory to build Model Ts in Manchester, to circumvent the import tariffs that, up to that point, had increased the effective price of foreign cars. Under the RAC's formula the Model T was a 22 'tax horsepower' car, making it more expensive to run than its British-built rivals on sale for the same price.\nAt first the RAC rating was usually representative of the car's actual (brake) horsepower, but as engine design and technology progressed in the 1920s and 1930s these two figures began to diverge, with engines making much more power than their RAC ratings suggested: by 1924 the 747 cc (45.6 cu in) engine of the Austin Seven (named for its 7 hp rating) produced 10.5 brake horsepower, 50 percent more than its official rating.\n\nIt became common for the name of a model to include both its RAC tax horsepower and its actual power output, such as the Wolseley 14/60 and the Alvis 12/70 of 1938.\nTo minimise tax ratings British designers developed engines with very long stroke and low piston surface area. Another effect was the multiplicity of models: Sevens, Eights, Nines, Tens, Elevens, Twelves, Fourteens, Sixteens etc. each to fit with a taxation class. Larger more lightly stressed engines may have been equally economical to run and, in less variety, produced much more economically. The system discouraged manufacturers from switching to more fuel-efficient overhead valve engines as these generally required larger bores, while the established sidevalve layout could easily use very narrow bores. Despite OHV engines having significant benefits in economy, refinement and performance, the RAC system made these engines more expensive to own because it placed them in a higher tax class than sidevalve engines of identical power output. Despite this, by 1948 the Standard Flying Twelve, a typical mid-size saloon, produced 44 bhp (45 PS; 33 kW) from a 1.6-litre (98 cu in) engine, nearly four times as much horsepower as the RAC system suggested.\nWhile the RAC system had protected the home market from the import of large-engined low-priced mass-produced American cars, the need for roomy generously proportioned cars for export was now paramount and the British government abandoned the tax horsepower system with effect from 1 January 1947 replacing it at first with a tax on cubic capacity, which was in turn replaced by a flat tax applying from 1 January 1948. However British cars and cars in other countries applying the same approach to automobile taxation continued to feature long, relatively narrow cylinders even in the 1950s and 1960s, partly because limited investment meant that new car models often had new bodies but their engines were carried over from earlier generations.\nThe emphasis on long strokes, combined with the nature of British roads in the pre-motorway era, meant that British engines tended to deliver strong low- and mid-range torque for their size, but low maximum speeds. The long stroke also meant that piston speeds and the load on the big end bearings became potentially damaging at high power outputs. Many smaller British cars did not cope well with sustained cruising at 60 mph (97 km/h) or more, which led to reliability problems when the vehicles were exported to other markets, especially the United States. Cars such as the Austin A40, the Morris Minor and the Hillman Minx all achieved notable initial sales success in the US in the late 1940s, until the short service life of the engines when asked to routinely drive long distances at freeway speeds became clear. Other imports originating in countries with different tax rules and existent high speed road networks, in particular the Volkswagen Beetle, proved more reliable, and achieved greater sales success.\n\n\n== Australia ==\nIn Australia, the various states had their own automobile taxation system. Several depended on the RAC formula, but the flaws of this system were well known as early as 1909. Another formula was the Dendy-Marshall formula, which included an engine's stroke. Several Australian states used Dendy-Marshall, although Western Australia reverted to RAC hp in 1957. The Union of South Africa also depended on Dendy-Marshall, at least in the 1920s. The Automobile Club of Australia's \"A.C.A. formula\" used the same calculations as did Dendy-Marshall formula. The Australian Bureau of Statistics used RAC hp in their Registration of New Motor Vehicles, Make of Vehicles, Australia statistics until this publication was discontinued in June 1976.Several Australian states also added vehicle weight to the power rating, to get a power-weight unit which determined taxation.\nThe Dendy-Marshall / A.C.A. formula is as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        P\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              D\n              \u00d7\n              D\n              \u00d7\n              L\n              \u00d7\n              n\n            \n            12\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle HP={\\frac {D\\times D\\times L\\times n}{12}}}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        H\n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle HP}\n   = nominal horsepower\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n    = the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n    = the length (or stroke) of the cylinder in inches\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n    = the number of cylinders\n\n\n== United States ==\nDuring the early twentieth century, automobiles in the United States were specified with a figure identical to RAC horsepower and computed using the same formula; this was known either as \"NACC horsepower\" (named for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce), \"ALAM horsepower\" (for NACC's predecessor, the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers), or \"SAE horsepower\" (for the Society of Automotive Engineers). (This last term should not be confused with later horsepower ratings by the SAE.) This value is still used for taxation and license fee purposes in the State of Missouri for passenger vehicles, with electric vehicles assigned to the 12-23 Horsepower bracket by statute.\n\n\n== Continental Europe ==\nAlthough tax horsepower was computed on a similar basis in several other European countries during the two or three decades before the Second World War, continental cylinder dimensions were quoted in millimeters. As a result of roundings when converting the formula between the two measurement systems, a British tax horse-power unit ended up being worth 1.014 continental (i.e. French) tax horse-power units.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nIn Belgium, the tax power depended on the cubic capacity of the engine in cubic centimeters at the rate of 1 tax horse power for every 200 cm3 (12 cu in).\n\n\n=== France ===\nThe Cheval Fiscal, often abbreviated to CV from \"chevaux-vapeur\" (literally 'steam horses') in tax law, is used for the issuing of French registration certificates known as \"grey cards\" (cartes grises). It is an administrative unit originally calculated partly from the power of the engine and used to calculate the amount of tax that may be due at the time of registration.\nThe Citro\u00ebn 2CV (two tax horsepower) was the car that kept such a name for the longest time.\nIts use in France dates from 1 January 1913. It was updated in 1956, with further revisions in 1978 and a new emission-based system introduced in 1998.\nIt was originally defined using the following formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        V\n        =\n        n\n        \u00d7\n        \n          D\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u00d7\n        L\n        \u00d7\n        \u03c9\n        \u00d7\n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle CV=n\\times D^{2}\\times L\\times \\omega \\times K}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   is the number of cylinders,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   is the cylinder bore in centimeters,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n   is the stroke in centimeters,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega }\n   is the engine speed in revolutions per second,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n   is a coefficient depending on the number of cylinders (single-cylinder engine : 0.00020; two-cylinder engine : 0.00017; four-cylinder engine: 0.00015; six-or-more-cylinder engine: 0.00013)\n\n\n==== 1956 formula ====\nIn a circular issued on 28 December 1956, the chevaux fiscaux was defined as:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        \n          K\n          \u00d7\n          n\n          \u00d7\n          \n            D\n            \n              2\n            \n          \n          \u00d7\n          L\n          \u00d7\n          w\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P={K\\times n\\times D^{2}\\times L\\times w}}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n   = puissance administrative,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n   = constant of 0.00015,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   = number of cylinders,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   = bore in centimetres,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        L\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L}\n   = stroke in centimetres,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        w\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle w}\n   = speed of rotation in revolutions per secondThe result is multiplied by 0.7 for a diesel engine.\n\n\n==== 1978 formula ====\nA new system was announced on 23 December 1977 to come into force on 1 January 1978 calculated by the following formula:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        m\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              0.0458\n               \n              \n                \n                  C\n                  K\n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            1.48\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P=m\\left(0.0458\\ {\\frac {C}{K}}\\right)^{1.48}}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P}\n   = puissance administrative,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n   = coefficient of 1 for petrol or 0.7 for diesel,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C}\n   = engine capacity in cubic centimetres,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        K\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle K}\n   = parameter calculated from a weighted arithmetic average speed in kilometers per hour theoretically reached by the vehicle at an engine speed of 1000 revolutions per minute in each gearbox ratio (see dropdown table to the right for more details).\n\n\n==== 1998 formula ====\nFrom 1998 until January 2020, the fiscal tax depended on a standardised value of carbon dioxide CO2 emissions in grams per kilometer (g/km) and the maximum engine power in kilowatts (kW).

(For commercial vehicles vehicle tax became a function of vehicle weight.) Attempts to correlate new tax horsepower values with old ones result in small differences due to roundings used in the new formula which are, for most purposes, unimportant.\nIn 1933 the Hitler government came into power and identified promotion of the auto-industry as key to economic recovery:  new cars purchased after April 1933 were no longer burdened by an annual car tax charge and German passenger car production surged from 41,727 in 1932 to 276,804 in 1938. Thereafter war and military defeat led to a change in car tax policy and after 1945 tax horse-power returned in West Germany, applying the 1928 formula, as a determinant of annual car tax on new cars purchased in or after 1945. However, the introduction of tax on road fuel in 1951 and progressive increases in fuel tax thereafter reduced the importance of annual car tax so that today far more of the tax on car ownership is collected via fuel taxes than via annual car tax.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nFiscal horsepower is still used in Italy for insurance purposes; it was formerly used also for car property taxation and it is based on engine displacement.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nFiscal horsepower also lives on in Spain, but is defined simply in terms of overall engine capacity. It therefore encourages small engines, but does not influence the ratio of cylinder bore to stroke. The current Spanish definition does, however, add a factor that varies in order to favour four-stroke engines over two-stroke engines.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            f\n          \n        \n        =\n        T\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              0.785\n              \u22c5\n              \n                D\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n              \u22c5\n              R\n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            0.6\n          \n        \n        \u22c5\n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{f}=T\\left({0.785\\cdot D^{2}\\cdot R}\\right)^{0.6}\\cdot n}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            f\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{f}}\n   = Tax Horsepower (Potencia fiscal),\n\n  \n    \n      \n        T\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle T}\n     = 0.08 for four-stroke engines, 0.11 for two-stroke engines,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n     = cylinder bore in centimeters,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        R\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle R}\n     = stroke length in centimeters,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n     = Number of cylinders\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nThe 26 cantons of Switzerland used (and use) a variety of different taxation methods. Originally, all of Switzerland used the tax horsepower, calculated as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          CV/PS\n        \n        =\n        0.4\n        \u00d7\n        i\n        \u00d7\n        \n          d\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u00d7\n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{CV/PS}}=0.4\\times i\\times d^{2}\\times S}\n  where:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        i\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i}\n     = the number of cylinders,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n     = the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in cm,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n     = the piston stroke in cmor 1.6/\u03c0 = 0.51 times engine displacement in cc\nThe limits between the horsepower denominations were drawn at either 0.49, 0.50, or 0.51 in different cantons. Thus, the eight horsepower category would cover cars of about 7.5\u20138.5 CV. In 1973 Berne switched to a taxation system based on vehicle weight, and a few other cantons followed. In 1986 Ticino switched to a system based on a calculation including engine size and weight. Nonetheless, the tax horsepower system remains in effect for seven cantons as of 2007. The plethora of different taxation systems has contributed to there always being an uncommonly wide variety of different cars marketed in Switzerland.\n\n\n== Japan ==\nIn pre-war Japan, different prefectures had different automobile tax structures. Tokyo Prefecture was naturally the strictest, due to the population and vehicle density there, and used a tax horsepower system of their own devising:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          tax HP\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              D\n              \u00d7\n              S\n              \u00d7\n              n\n            \n            3\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{tax HP}}={\\frac {D\\times S\\times n}{3}}}\n  where\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D}\n   = the diameter (or bore) of the cylinder in inches,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle S}\n   = the piston stroke in inches,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n   = the number of cylindersUnlike the British system, the Tokyo system favored short-stroked engines, but since the tax categories were rather wide and only represented a portion of vehicle taxes it had less impact on sales. In 1950 new legislation was passed that taxed engine displacement in 500 cc increments. The automobile tax is paid every year during the road tax obligation.\n\n\n== Impact on engine design and on auto-industry development ==\nThe fiscal benefits of reduced cylinder diameters (bore) in favor of longer cylinders (stroke) may have been a factor in encouraging the proliferation of relatively small six-cylinder-engined models appearing in Europe in the 1930s, as the market began to open up for faster middle-weight models. The system clearly perpetuated side-valve engines in countries where the taxation system encouraged these engine designs, and delayed the adoption of overhead valve engines because the small cylinder diameter reduced the space available for overhead valves and the lengthy combustion chamber in any case reduced their potential for improving combustion efficiency.\nAnother effect was to make it very expensive to run cars imported from countries where there was no fiscal incentive to minimise cylinder diameters: this may have limited car imports from the US to Europe during a period when western governments were employing naked protectionist policies in response to economic depression, and thereby encouraged US auto-makers wishing to exploit the European auto-markets to set up their own dedicated subsidiary plants in the larger European markets.\nTaxation can modify incentives and tax horsepower is no exception. Large capacity (displacement) engines are penalized, so engineers working where engine capacity is taxed are encouraged to minimize capacity. This rarely happened in the US, where license plate fees, even adjusted for horsepower ratings, were comparatively much lower than European car taxes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThis entry incorporates information from the equivalent entry in the French Wikipedia at 31 December 2009\nThis entry incorporates information from the equivalent entry in the Spanish Wikipedia at 31 December 2009",

Under this program, RCAS instrumented and operated various ships and stations on the Air Force Eastern Test Range with electronic tracking and telemetry equipment.

The tracking station planned for South Africa was never fully instrumented and eventually found to be redundant.???\nThe tracking station, Station 13,  in South Africa (at Bapsfontein near Pretoria) operated from about 1960 until 1969 and had a tracking radar, telemetry site and GLOTRAC\n\n\n== Instrumented ships ==\nThe following small diesel-powered ships were instrumented with tracking equipment: Sword Knot, Rose Knot, Timber Hitch, Coastal Crusader, Coastal Sentry, and Sampam Hitch.  In 1964 three very highly advanced instrumented ships were added to the MTP inventory: the USAFS General H. H. Arnold and USAFS General Hoyt S. Vandenberg (both Type C4 ships), as well as the USAS American Mariner (a converted Liberty ship).\nThese tracking ships, when operated under the direct supervision and operational control of PAA GMRD, were termed \"Ocean Range Vessel\" (ORV).\n\n\n== Operations and support ==\nThe management, logistics and infrastructure of the tracking stations were under the control of PAA GMRD while electronic equipment, such as the tracking radars, was under the control of RCAS personnel. Some bases, such as those at Antigua and at Chagaramus, Trinidad, were located in populated areas and, in some cases, technical personnel were permitted to bring their families with them.\nSome tracking stations, such as the one at Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, were inhospitable and unpopulated and, as a result, it was not feasible for technical personnel to bring their families with them. However, since the Ascension Island tracking station grew to be a very large one and required a large number of maintenance laborers, temporary rotating forces of workers were recruited from tiny Saint Helena Island, located about 800 miles to the south.\nTracking ships were likewise managed by PAA GMRD personnel in areas of operation and logistics. Maintenance and operation of technical equipment, such as radars and related equipment, were under the operational control of RCAS.\nTracking ships normally operated in the South Atlantic Ocean, and the port of Recife, Brazil, contained a small contingent of PAA GMRD and RCAS personnel to assist technical personnel when their vessel arrived in the port for fuel, U.S. mail, logistics, or a recreation period. Providing in-port periods of rest and relaxation for technical personnel and crew members was a priority requirement, since the tracking ships often remained at sea for a month or more.\nThe Vandenberg and Arnold also operated in the Pacific Ocean (North and South). They supported missile launches out of Vandenberg AFB and other locations.\nSince RCA employed over a thousand personnel in Florida and downrange on the tracking stations and ships, PAA GMRD provided administrative personnel at each major location to authorize and provide travel orders for the constant movement by air of technical personnel. Air transport on prop-driven aircraft was initially provided by the MATS (Military Air Transport Service) and later by the MAC (Military Airlift Command).\n\n\n== See also ==\nRadar\nMissile\nCold war\nEastern Test Range\nPan American Airways Guided Missile Range Division\nPatrick Space Force Base\nAir Force Technical Applications Center\nList of ships of the United States Air Force\nUSAS American Mariner\n\n\n== External links ==\nSelf-Calibration of Land-Based Pulse Radar from Satellite Track\nPatrick Air Force Base",

Professor Monica M. Ringer described Aryana as probably the most notorious \u201cconverted Zoroastrian\u201d of the Pahlavi era.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nHe was born on 17 March 1906 in Tehran from a Georgian mother, whose ancestor was King Heraclius II, and from a judge father, Sadr-ed-din. His name was Hossein Manouchehri, which he would change it to Bahram Aryana in 1950. Professor Monica M. Ringer has described Aryana as probably the most notorious \u201cconverted Zoroastrian\u201d of the Pahlavi era.He was educated in France at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieur de Guerre and received his PhD in 1955 from the Faculty of Law of Paris with his thesis \"Napoleon et l'Orient\" (published in 1957). Aryana is known to have styled himself on Napoleon and dressed in the Imperial French style.After the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 during World War II, he went on with armed struggle and resisted the occupation before being arrested by the British forces. He was instrumental in many of the nationalist policies in the 1950-1960s. During the military campaign of 1964-65 he successfully pacified rebellious tribes in the south of Iran (Pars, Isfahan and Khuzestan) stirred-up by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, without shedding blood.\n\nFollowing his military success in the south, General Aryana was named Chief of Staff of the Shah's Army, position he maintained from 1965 to 1969.\nDuring his posting as Chief of Staff, he met with various head of states including Richard Nixon, who received him at the White House, Yitzhak Rabin (then the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces), who received him in Israel and General de Gaulle, during his visit to Iran.\nAryana left Iran in 1969 on the order of the Shah. This was due to the Arvand Rud (Shatt al-Arab) crisis.\nUnlike his fellow Arteshbod and exiled leader, Gholam-Ali Oveissi. Aryana was 'beloved' by the Kurdish population of Iran from his time as the military governor of Kurdistan.\nHe died in exile in Paris in June 1985 and is buried at the Montparnasse cemetery. General Aryana was a Grand Officier of the French Legion of Honour.\nHis last published book, Pour une \u00c9thique Iranienne was a call for unity against the obscurantist forces driving Khomeini and the mullahs' fundamentalist revolution.\n\n\n== Party affiliation ==\nAryana described himself as being an Iranian nationalist and moderate socialist, not a monarchist. Although he received a great deal of support from monarchists who considered him to be a supporter. Aryana held dual membership of Aria Party and SUMKA.He founded Azadegan, a nationalist opposition group which had \"developed a full command staff structure and support from all nationalist elements from the moderate left to the monarchists\". while in exile in Paris.\nAryana combined his forces with not just Gholam Ali Oveissi but also Shapour Bakhtiar, Ahmad Madani and Ali Amini. Azadegan, meaning Born Free, was an anti-Khomeini movement which claimed as many as 12,000 followers in Iran, many of them in the armed forces. The daring seizing by Azadegan's officers of Tabarzin, an Iranian Navy's Combattante II class fast attack craft just built by France and en route to Iran while in the Mediterranean in August 1981, attracted media attention to Azadegan and its members' armed resistance against the clerical regime of Iran.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",
    "Mehli Irani": "Mehli Dinshaw Irani (26 June 1930 \u2013 3 April 2021) was an Indian cricketer, who played as a left-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Irani played in the Kanga Cricket League for over 50 years. He made one appearance for Bombay in the Ranji Trophy, and also played club cricket for Bombay University and Parsee Cyclists.\n\n\n== Career ==\nIrani was a left-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. He captained the St. Xavier's College cricket team, and later played club cricket for Bombay Gymkhana and Parsee Cyclists. At Bombay Gymkhana, Irani played alongside Rohan Gavaskar, the son of Test cricketer Sunil Gavaskar.In December 1951, Irani played for Bombay University in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club. In the match, he played alongside Madhusudan Patil, the father of Test cricketer Sandeep Patil. In the 1952\u201353 season, Irani captained a Bombay University team that included five future Test match players: (Nari Contractor, Naren Tamhane, Chandrakant Patankar, Gundibail Sunderam and Ramnath Kenny). In one match captained by Irani, five catches were dropped in the opening over. The Bombay University team won that year's Rohinta Barion Trophy, after defeating Delhi in the final. In 1953, Irani made his only appearance in the Ranji Trophy, playing for Bombay in a match against Baroda. He was out lbw to Vijay Hazare for 17. Irani's team-mate Shishir Hattangadi said that Irani was disappointed to have only ever played one Ranji Trophy match.Irani played in the Kanga Cricket League, a monsoon season cricket tournament, for 57 years, starting in 1949. He described the difficulty of batting in the tournament: \"A person who gets 30 or 40 runs is as good as getting a 50 or a 100 when you play on a dry wicket, the uncertainty of the wicket added to Kanga League\u2019s beauty.\" He played for Parsee Cyclists, and took over the captaincy of the side from Nari Contractor. In 1991, Irani stumped Sachin Tendulkar in a Kanga League match. Irani played as a wicket-keeper even in his 60s, before retiring from cricket at the age of 69.\n\n\n== Personal life and death ==\nAt Bombay Cricket Club, Irani was nicknamed the \"centre table man\". Irani was married to Dhanu, and they had two daughters. He continued to attend Bombay Gymkhana cricket matches even after his retirement, until he moved to Dubai in December 2020 to be near one of his daughters. Irani died on 3 April 2021 in Dubai, and his death was announced by the Mumbai Cricket Association. His funeral was held the next day.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nESPN Cricinfo",

    "Social construction of technology": "Social construction of technology (SCOT) is a theory within the field of science and technology studies. Advocates of SCOT\u2014that is, social constructivists\u2014argue that technology does not determine human action, but that rather, human action shapes technology. They also argue that the ways a technology is used cannot be understood without understanding how that technology is embedded in its social context. SCOT is a response to technological determinism and is sometimes known as technological constructivism.\nSCOT draws on work done in the constructivist school of the sociology of scientific knowledge, and its subtopics include actor-network theory  (a branch of the sociology of science and technology) and historical analysis of sociotechnical systems, such as the work of historian Thomas P. Hughes. Its empirical methods are an adaptation of the Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR), which outlines a method of analysis to demonstrate the ways in which scientific findings are socially constructed (see strong program). Leading adherents of SCOT include Wiebe Bijker and Trevor Pinch.\nSCOT holds that those who seek to understand the reasons for acceptance or rejection of a technology should look to the social world. It is not enough, according to SCOT, to explain a technology's success by saying that it is \"the best\"\u2014researchers must look at how the criteria of being \"the best\" is defined and what groups and stakeholders participate in defining it. In particular, they must ask who defines the technical criteria success is measured by, why technical criteria are defined this way, and who is included or excluded.  Pinch and Bijker argue that technological determinism is a myth that results when one looks backwards and believes that the path taken to the present was the only possible path.\nSCOT is not only a theory, but also a methodology: it formalizes the steps and principles to follow when one wants to analyze the causes of technological failures or successes.\n\n\n== Legacy of the Strong Programme in the sociology of science ==\nAt the point of its conception, the SCOT approach was partly motivated by the ideas of the strong programme in the sociology of science (Bloor 1973). In their seminal article, Pinch and Bijker refer to the Principle of Symmetry as the most influential tenet of the Sociology of Science, which should be applied in historical and sociological investigations of technology as well. It is strongly connected to Bloor's theory of social causation.\n\n\n=== Symmetry ===\nThe Principle of Symmetry holds that in explaining the origins of scientific beliefs, that is, assessing the success and failure of models, theories, or experiments, the historian/sociologist should deploy the same kind of explanation in the cases of success as in cases of failure. When investigating beliefs, researchers should be impartial to the (a posteriori attributed) truth or falsehood of those beliefs, and the explanations should be unbiased. The strong programme adopts a position of relativism or neutralism regarding the arguments that social actors put forward for the acceptance/rejection of any technology.  All arguments (social, cultural, political, economic, as well as technical) are to be treated equally.The symmetry principle addresses the problem that the historian is tempted to explain the success of successful theories by referring to their \"objective truth\", or inherent \"technical superiority\", whereas s/he is more likely to put forward sociological explanations (citing political influence or economic reasons) only in the case of failures. For example, having experienced the obvious success of the chain-driven bicycle for decades, it is tempting to attribute its success to its \"advanced technology\" compared to the \"primitiveness\" of the Penny Farthing, but if we look closely and symmetrically at their history (as Pinch and Bijker do), we can see that at the beginning bicycles were valued according to quite different standards than nowadays. The early adopters (predominantly young, well-to-do gentlemen) valued the speed, the thrill, and the spectacularity of the Penny Farthing \u2013 in contrast to the security and stability of the chain-driven Safety Bicycle. Many other social factors (e.g., the contemporary state of urbanism and transport, women's clothing habits and feminism) have influenced and changed the relative valuations of bicycle models.\nA weak reading of the Principle of Symmetry points out that there often are many competing theories or technologies, which all have the potential to provide slightly different solutions to similar problems. In these cases, sociological factors tip the balance between them: that's why we should pay equal attention to them.\nA strong, social constructivist reading would add that even the emergence of the questions or problems to be solved are governed by social determinations, so the Principle of Symmetry is applicable even to the apparently purely technical issues.\n\n\n== Original Core concepts ==\nThe Empirical Programme of Relativism (EPOR) introduced the SCOT theory in two stage.\n\n\n=== First Stage: Interpretative flexibility ===\nThe first stage of the SCOT research methodology is to reconstruct the alternative interpretations of the technology, analyze the problems and conflicts these interpretations give rise to, and connect them to the design features of the technological artifacts. The relations between groups, problems, and designs can be visualized in diagrams.\nInterpretative flexibility means that each technological artifact has different meanings and interpretations for various groups. Bijker and Pinch show that the air tire of the bicycle meant a more convenient mode of transportation for some people, whereas it meant technical nuisances, traction problems and ugly aesthetics to others. In racing air tires lent to greater speed.These alternative interpretations generate different problems to be solved. How should aesthetics, convenience, and speed be prioritized? What is the \"best\" tradeoff between traction and speed?\n\n\n==== Relevant social groups ====\nThe most basic relevant groups are the users and the producers of the technological artifact, but most often many subgroups can be delineated \u2013 users with different socioeconomic status, competing producers, etc. Sometimes there are relevant groups who are neither users, nor producers of the technology, for example, journalists, politicians, and civil organizations. Trevor Pinch has argued that the salespeople of technology should also be included in the study of technology.  The groups can be distinguished based on their shared or diverging interpretations of the technology in question.\n\n\n==== Design flexibility ====\nJust as technologies have different meanings in different social groups, there are always multiple ways of constructing technologies. A particular design is only a single point in the large field of technical possibilities, reflecting the interpretations of certain relevant groups.\n\n\n==== Problems and conflicts ====\nThe different interpretations often give rise to conflicts between criteria that are hard to resolve technologically (e.g., in the case of the bicycle, one such problem was how a woman could ride the bicycle in a skirt while still adhering to standards of decency), or conflicts between the relevant groups (the \"Anti-cyclists\" lobbied for the banning of the bicycles). Different groups in different societies construct different problems, leading to different designs.\n\n\n=== Second Stage: Closure ===\nThe second stage of the SCOT methodology is to show how closure is achieved.\nOver time, as technologies are developed, the interpretative and design flexibility collapse through closure mechanisms. Two examples of closure mechanisms:\n\nRhetorical closure: When social groups see the problem as being solved, the need for alternative designs diminishes. This is often the result of advertising.\nRedefinition of the problem: A design standing in the focus of conflicts can be stabilized by using it to solve a different, new problem, which ends up being solved by this very design. As an example, the aesthetic and technical problems of the air tire diminished, as the technology advanced to the stage where air tire bikes started to win the bike races. Tires were still considered cumbersome and ugly, but they provided a solution to the \"speed problem\", and this overrode previous concerns.Closure is not permanent.  New social groups may form and reintroduce interpretative flexibility, causing a new round of debate or conflict about a technology. (For instance, in the 1890s automobiles were seen as the \"green\" alternative, a cleaner environmentally-friendly technology, to horse-powered vehicles; by the 1960s, new social groups had introduced new interpretations about the environmental effects of the automobile, eliciting the opposite conclusion.)\n\n\n== Subsequent extension of the SCOT theory ==\nMany other historians and sociologists of technology extended the original SCOT theory.\n\n\n=== Technological Frame ===\n\n\n=== Relating the content of the technological artifact to the wider sociopolitical milieu ===\nThis is often considered the third stage of the original theory.\nFor example, Paul N. Edwards shows in his book \"The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America\" the strong relations between the political discourse of the Cold War and the computer designs of this era.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nIn 1993, Langdon Winner published a critique of SCOT entitled \"Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding it Empty: Social Constructivism and the Philosophy of Technology.\"  In it, he argues that social constructivism is an overly narrow research program. He identifies the following specific limitations in social constructivism:\n\nIt explains how technologies arise, but ignores the consequences of the technologies after the fact. This results in a sociology that says nothing about how such technologies matter in the broader context.\nIt examines social groups and interests that contribute to the construction of technology, but ignores those who have no voice in the process, yet are affected by it. Likewise, when documenting technological contingencies and choices, it fails to account for those options that never made it to the table. According to Winner, this results in conservative and elitist sociology.\nIt is superficial in that it focuses on how the immediate needs, interests, problems and solutions of chosen social groups influence technological choice, but disregards any possible deeper cultural, intellectual or economic origins of social choices concerning technology.\nIt actively avoids taking any kind of moral stance or passing judgment on the relative merits of the alternative interpretations of a technology. This indifference makes it unhelpful in addressing important debates about the place of technology in human affairs.Other critics include Stewart Russell with his letter in the journal Social Studies of Science titled \"The Social Construction of Artifacts: A Response to Pinch and Bijker\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of science and technology\nIndustrial sociology\nScience and technology studies (STS)\nSocial shaping of technology\nSystems theory\nSociocultural evolution\nSociology of scientific knowledge\nTechnology dynamics\nTheories of technology\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nPinch, Trevor J. and Wiebe E.

    "Crystal City Internment Camp": "Crystal City Internment Camp, located near Crystal City, Texas, was a place of confinement for people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent during World War II, and has been variously described as a detention facility or a concentration camp. The camp, which was originally designed to hold 3,500 people, opened in December 1943 and was officially closed on February 11, 1948.Officially known as the Crystal City Alien Enemy Detention Facility (more commonly referred to as U.S. Family Internment Camp, Crystal City, Texas),  the camp was operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) under the Department of Justice and was originally designed to hold Japanese families, but later held German families, as well, including many who were deported from Latin American countries to the U.S. A significant number of those incarcerated were native-born American citizens. Over 127,000 United States citizens were imprisoned during World War II. The Crystal City Internment Camp was one of the primary confinement facilities in the United States for families during World War II.The detention camps were described at the time as an \"internal security\" measure, but are now considered to have been \"unjust and motivated by racism rather than real military necessity\", as reported by the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians.The camp held 3,374 detainees on December 29, 1944. This was the maximum it ever held.\n\n\n== Establishment of camp ==\nCrystal City, named after the town it neighbors and located 110 miles (180 km) south of San Antonio, was one of the largest camps in Texas. Before the war, Crystal City had been a migrant labor camp, built by the Farm Security Administration (FSA) to house an influx of migrant workers who came to farm the area's most profitable crop, spinach.At the start of World War II, thousands of Japanese and German residents of the U.S., including both U.S. citizens and resident aliens, were arrested and separated from their families during their initial detention. The FSA camp was turned over to the INS to allow these so-called \"enemy aliens\" to be reunited with their wives and children, and the first group of 35 German families arrived on December 12, 1942.Women and children from Camp Seagoville, which was opened to house Latin American Japanese and became overcrowded with the addition of domestic Japanese American incarcerates, began arriving in early 1943, and their husbands and fathers were transferred to Crystal City from Camp Kenedy and several War Relocation Authority camps, beginning in June. By August 1944, the camp held 2,104 people of Japanese ancestry (about half from Latin America) and 804 people of German descent, housed separately by ethnicity.\n\n\n== The internees ==\n\n\n=== Latin Americans ===\n\nEarly in the war, in the name of \"hemispheric security\", the United States government began negotiations with several Latin American countries to round up and deport German and Japanese nationals who had been living in those countries. Upon their arrival in New Orleans, Louisiana, the initial male deportees were arrested on the grounds that they had attempted to enter the country illegally (having been denied visas by immigration authorities) and detained at various INS stations in the region, before being relocated to the internment camps at Kenedy, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Their wives and children followed them later \u2014 ostensibly as volunteers, although most families lacked feasible alternatives to deportation.Once incarcerated in the United States, they could then be sent to Germany or Japan in exchange for the return of American citizens and diplomats stranded in Axis nations. The prisoner-exchange program proved to be short-lived, and eventually transitioned into a \"repatriation\" program in which German and Japanese nationals and their families (including many children who had never been to their \"home\" country) were deported once again to Germany and Japan. The majority of Crystal City's Latin American population was transported to Germany and Japan at the end of the war, although several hundred Japanese Peruvians were allowed to remain in the U.S. after a two-year legal battle.Of the nearly 1,500 Latin American Japanese confined in Crystal City during the war, almost 80% came from Peru. The 234 Latin American Germans had been deported from Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, in addition to a few from Haiti.\n\n\n=== German and Japanese Americans ===\nThe Crystal City camp also held Japanese and German Americans who previously lived in many different parts of the United States. Noncitizen Japanese and German men were arrested in large numbers immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor and forcibly incarcerated in various INS, U.S. Army, and Department of Justice detention sites before being transferred to Crystal City, where they were reunited with their families. The first German American incarcerees arrived in December 1942 from Ellis Island and Camp Forrest. The first Japanese Americans were women and children brought to Crystal City from Seagoville in March 1943. Additional Japanese Americans were transported by train from western detention facilities and WRA camps in the following months. Most of the Japanese-American incarcerees were transported from the West Coast, while the German Americans were brought from numerous locations throughout the United States.\n\n\n== Internment life ==\n\nThe idea of family internment was a new concept proposed with regards to the detention of German and Japanese aliens in World War II. In the Crystal City internment camp, German and Japanese internees lived separately from one another and were placed in two different sections of the camp. Crystal City INS officials justified the segregation as a way to monitor both groups. The Crystal City Internment Camp received large numbers of detainees from other internment facilities in the United States and the camp became overpopulated.The camp's German section provided its internees with a German bakery, mess hall, community hall, and cottages. Large German families were given their own cottages that included showers, kitchens, bathrooms, and hot water. A weekly German-language newsletter was published, with the title Unter uns.The Japanese section included a Japanese school, the Federal High School, the Federal Elementary School, a citrus orchard, and several recreational facilities such as tennis courts, basketball courts, a football field, and a swimming pool. The Japanese internees of the camp lived in housing with running water and iceboxes.\n\n\n=== Children ===\nAlmost all of the children held at the Crystal City internment camp were native-born American citizens whose parents were alien non-citizens. Each child at the Crystal City Internment Camp received a quart of milk each day. Three schools were established: the German School, the Japanese School, and the American Schools of Federal Elementary and Federal High School. The schools provided the interned students with all of the basic programs that schools in Texas were required to have.Established in January 1943, the American School at the Crystal City Internment Camp educated over 1000 students before being closed in June 1946. Most of the American School's students at Crystal City were Japanese-American internees and a large number of the students were later accepted into various universities in the United States. The parents of German-American students refused to send their children to the American School, preferring education at the German School. The German-American children who transferred into the German School from the American School often struggled in the classroom because they were unable to speak German fluently. The German School and the American Schools had  similar enrollments, and each school educated about 350 students. The Japanese School educated about 300 Latin American Japanese and Japanese American students. The Japanese School's curriculum resembled the curriculum students in Japan received, focusing on Japanese morals, ethics, and physical education.\n\n\n=== School closing ===\nOn January 24, 1946 Crystal City Internment Camp official J. L. O'Rourke closed the German and Japanese schools and ordered that all remaining students enroll in the American schools. The American schools were then closed on June 28, 1946, but only 16 Japanese students still remained in Crystal City with their parents. The population of the camp was already low because numerous internees were repatriated to their native countries after the war ended. The INS rejected the proposed idea of transferring the Japanese students into public schools near Crystal City. Due to the INS decision and the lack of resources to move elsewhere, the remaining Japanese internees reinstalled the Japanese School.\n\n\n== Camp closing ==\nIn 1945, as the war was coming to an end, delegates to the Mexico City Conference on the Problems of War and Peace declared that a person would be subject to removal from the Western Hemisphere should their remaining in the Americas prove \"prejudicial\" to security, and in September, President Harry Truman issued a proclamation that authorized the deportation of enemy aliens in the U.S. \"without admission under the immigration laws.\" At the end of the year, the camp still held 3,374 inmates: 2,371 Japanese and 997 Germans, as well as six Italians. By December, 660 Japanese Peruvians (whose country prohibited them from returning) had been transported to Japan and 600 Japanese Hawaiians were returned to their prewar communities. By June 1946, most of the remaining German and Japanese internees, including another 900 Japanese Peruvians, had been deported. Crystal City remained open, however, to house Japanese Peruvians who had refused to participate in the government's repatriation program. With the help of civil rights attorney Wayne M. Collins, 364 internees filed a lawsuit and, after two years, obtained parole to work at Seabrook Farms in New Jersey. The Crystal City Internment camp was officially closed upon their release on February 11, 1948.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe site of the camp is now owned by the local school district, and is marked by a granite stone engraved with \"World War II Concentration Camp, 1943-1946\", which was installed in November 1985. The Texas Historical Commission undertook archaeological excavations at the site in April 2013, in preparation for nominating the site for listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

    "Price Commission": "The Price Commission was set up in the UK under the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, alongside the Pay Board, in an attempt to control inflation.  The Conservative government of Edward Heath, elected at the 1970 general election, had previously abolished the Prices and Incomes Board in November 1970, shortly after taking power, relying on competition to keep prices down.  At the same time, the Industrial Relations Act 1971 was intended to rein in the trades unions.\nThe Conservatives' economic policy was not successful, and the government took a U-turn.  A 90-day freeze of pay and prices (as well as rents and dividends) was introduced on 6 November 1972 under the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972.  This was replaced by a Price and Pay Code, which strictly limited increases, supervised by a new Price Commission and a Pay Board.\nThe Conservatives were unable to keep power after the inconclusive February 1974 UK general election, and the Pay Board was abolished in July 1974 by the minority Labour government led by Harold Wilson, but the Price Commission continued.  The scope of its powers were amended by the Price Commission Act 1977 and the Price Commission (Amendment) Act 1979.\nControls on prices were abolished soon after the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election, and the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 was repealed by the Competition Act 1980.\n\n\n== External links ==\nGovernment measures in the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1980, Appendix D to Innovation and Industrial Strength In the UK, West Germany, United States and Japan from the Policy Studies Institute, 1989 (PDF), ISBN 0-85374-458-0",

    "Freda Bedi": "Freda Bedi (born Freda Marie Houlston; 5 February 1911 \u2013 26 March 1977), also known as Sister Palmo or Gelongma Karma Kechog Palmo, was a British woman who was jailed in India as a supporter of Indian nationalism and was the first Western woman to take full ordination in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nFreda Marie Houlston was born in a flat above her father's jewellery and watch repair business in Monk Street in Derby. When she was still a baby, the family moved to Littleover, a suburb of Derby. \nFreda's father served in the First World War and was enrolled in the Machine Guns Corps. He was killed in northern France on 14 April 1918. Her mother, Nellie, remarried in 1920, to Frank Norman Swan. Freda studied at Hargrave House and then at Parkfields Cedars School, both in Derby. She also spent several months studying at a school in Rheims in northern France. She succeeded in gaining admission to St Hugh's College, Oxford to study French, being awarded an Exhibition or minor scholarship. \n\n\n== Life at Oxford ==\nAt Oxford, Freda Houlston changed her subject from French to Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). She met her husband Baba Pyare Lal \"BPL\" Bedi, an Indian from Lahore, on her PPE course. He was a Sikh from the Bedi family, linked to a Sikh clan tracing back to Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Romance blossomed and they married at Oxford Registry Office in June 1933, in spite of the reservations of her family and disciplinary action by her college. \nWhilst at Oxford Freda became involved in politics. She attended meetings of the Oxford Majlis, where nationalist-minded Indian students gathered, as well as of the communist October Club and the Labour Club. This was another bond with BPL Bedi, who became a keen communist and opponent of Empire. The couple together edited four books on India's struggle for Independence. At St Hugh's her closest friends included Barbara Castle, later a prominent Labour cabinet minister, and the broadcaster Olive Shapley. All three women graduated with a third-class degree; Freda's husband got a fourth-class degree.\n\n\n== Life in India ==\nAfter a year in Berlin where B.P.L. Bedi was studying - and where their first child, Ranga,  was born - Freda, her husband and baby son sailed to India in 1934. She worked as a journalist and taught English at a women's college in Lahore, and with her husband published a high quality quarterly review \"Contemporary India\". They also later published a weekly political paper, \"Monday Morning\".  Freda regularly contributed articles to Lahore's main nationalist daily, The Tribune. Both she and her husband were leftists and campaigning nationalists active in India's independence movement.  The couple's second child, Tilak, died when less than a year old. The family lived in an encampment of huts, without power or running water, outside Model Town in Lahore.\"Baba\" Bedi spent about fifteen months in an internment camp at Deoli in the early stages of World War Two because as a communist he was seeking to disrupt recruitment of Punjabis into the British Indian army. Freda herself was jailed for three months in 1941 as a satyagrahi after deliberately defying the wartime regulations as part of a civil disobedience campaign spearheaded by Mohandas K. Gandhi After independence in 1947, Bedi and her family moved to Kashmir, where husband and wife were influential supporters of Sheikh Abdullah, the left-wing Kashmiri nationalist leader. She joined a  women's militia for a while and taught English at a newly established women's college in Srinagar in Kashmir. Later in Delhi, she became editor of the magazine \"Social Welfare\" of the Ministry of Welfare. \nFreda Bedi briefly served as a member of the United Nations Social Services Planning Commission to Burma, during which she was first exposed to Buddhism, which quickly became the defining aspect of her life. In Rangoon she learned vipassana from Mahasi Sayadaw, and Sayadaw U Titthila.\n In Delhi, she became a prominent Buddhist and in 1956, when the 14th Dalai Lama made his first visit to India, she showed him around Buddhist shrines in Delhi.In 1959, when the Dalai Lama arrived in India after an arduous trek across the Himalayas followed by thousands of his Tibetan devotees, she was asked by India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru to help them and spent time improving facilities for refugees at camps in Assam and West Bengal. She became an observant Tibetan Buddhist and she followed the guidance of the 16th Karmapa of the Kagyu School. She worked, with the support of the Dalai Lama, to establish the Young Lamas Home School. Bedi initially set up the Young Lama's School in Delhi but after a short period it was moved to Dalhousie. The school trained young Tibetan lamas and monks in languages and social sciences as well as religion, to equip the coming generation of Tibetan spiritual leaders for life in exile. A number of Bedi's pupils became well-known teachers, including Chogyam Trungpa, Thubten Zopa Rinpoche, Akong Rinpoche, Tulku Pema Tenzin, Gelek Rimpoche, Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche, and the sons of Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, Chokyi Nyima and Chokling of Tsikey). In 1963, with Lama Karma Thinley Rinpoche and under the guidance of the Karmapa, she founded the Karma Drubgyu Thargay Ling nunnery for Tibetan women, now located in Tilokpur, Kangra Valley.\n\nWhile running the Young Lamas Home School at Dalhousie in north India, Bedi also spent time at Rumtek in Sikkim, the seat of the Karmapa in exile. In 1966, she took sramaneri ordination by the Karmapa and was given the name Karma Kechog Palmo. She was one of the first Western women to take ordination in Tibetan Buddhism. In 1972, she took full bhikshuni ordination in Hong Kong - the first western woman to do so, and according to the scholar Hanna Havnevik possibly the first woman in the Tibetan tradition ever to receive this higher ordination. She accompanied the Karmapa on his first visit to the West in 1974, a landmark five-month tour across North America and Europe. Although not fluent in Tibetan, she helped to translate prayers and religious texts into English.She is credited for bringing Tibetian Buddhism to the West.Bedi died in New Delhi on 26 March 1977. She was survived by two sons, Ranga Bedi, who was a tea planter, and Kabir Bedi, a Hollywood and Bollywood film and TV star, who was born in Lahore in 1946; a daughter, Gulhima, who was born in Srinagar in 1949, now lives in the United States.\n\n\n== Published works ==\nFreda Marie Houlston Bedi, Baba Pyare Lal Bedi, (editors) India analysed, three volumes published by Victor Gollancz, 1933-4\nFreda Marie Houlston Bedi, Behind the Mud Walls, Lahore: Unity Publishers, 1943\nFreda Bedi, Bengal Lamenting, Lahore: Lion, 1944\nBaba Pyare Lal Bedi, Freda Marie (Houlston) Bedi, Sheikh Abdullah: his life and ideals, pamphlet, c1949\nEin Rosenkranz von Morgengebeten : nach der Tradition des Mahayana \u2013 Buddhismus / aus dem Tibetischen ins Englische \u00fcbers. von Karma Khechog Palmo.

    "Medabots": "Medabots, known in Japan as Medarot (\u30e1\u30c0\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8, Medarotto), is a Japanese-Canadian role-playing video game franchise created by Rin Horuma (Horumarin) and currently owned by Imagineer. The main series of RPGs focus on collecting and battling with the titular robots. The bulk of the games releases have been on Nintendo platforms, including the Game Boy family, Nintendo GameCube, and the DS and 3DS handhelds.\nThe series was adapted into a Japanese anime television series spanning two adaptations. The first was animated by Bee Train while the second, Medarot Damashii, was animated by Production I.G. The television series originally aired on TV Tokyo from July 2, 1999 to March 30, 2001. Both series were originally licensed and localized into English by Nelvana and were broadcast on YTV in Canada and Fox Kids and ABC Family in the United States from 2001 to 2004.\nA manga series, written by Rin Horuma, was also produced. It was serialized in the children's magazine Comic BomBom in Japan and then published into collected volumes by Kodansha. The manga based on the first game, Medarot, was never translated into English, but the manga based on the sequel, Medarot 2, was licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media, simply under the title Medabots. Medarot 2, 3, and 4, have also been translated into English for distribution in Singapore by Chuang Yi.\nTo date, only Medabots (a remake of Medarot 2 for Game Boy Advance), Medabots AX, and Medabots Infinity have been released in North America. There have also been plastic models produced by Kotobukiya.\nA compilation game Medarot Classics Plus was released on November 12, 2020. It features the Kabuto and Kuwagata versions of the first eight mainline games.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Medabots ===\nThe series centers around Medabots, artificially intelligent robots, whose purpose is to serve humans in a future time. The series begins with a ten-year-old (nine in the Japanese version) boy named Ikki Tenry\u014d, who wants to become a champion of the World Robattle Tournament. However, Ikki is unable to afford a Medabot, and his parents refuse to buy him one. However, he manages to get enough money to buy an outdated model, and, with a bit of luck, he finds a medal in a river. Ikki quickly inserts it into the Medabot he purchased named Metabee. The only problem is that the medal he found gives Metabee a severe attitude problem (a problem rarely seen in a Medabot), which leads Ikki to think he is defective. However, this theory is proven wrong later in the series, as it is revealed that Metabee actually has a rare medal.\nThe rare medals were kept secret by the Medabot Corporation, as very little was known about them. However, a Medabot with a rare medal would be able to call upon an attack called the \"Medaforce\". In the manga, the Medaforce is a form of medal mind control, as explained by Dr. Aki in the third graphic novel of Medabots. In the cartoon however, it is shown as a way of increasing the power of the Medabot's special skill into a focused beam attack.\nAnother important aspect is the story of Henry, the store clerk who sold Ikki  Metabee. It is revealed that he is, quite obviously, Phantom Renegade. A running gag of the series was Henry almost telling everyone he is The Phantom, with no one ever discovering this fact. Space Medafighter X is introduced, who is another one of Henry's secret identities, the number one medafighter in Japan. Later, during the World Finals, he rarely shows up to the fights, instead sending substitutes and working behind the scenes. This being because he supposedly started The Ten Days of Darkness, which occurred eight years before the events in the series during the World Robattle Cup when Henry fought as Hikaru Agata with the original Metabee (however, the medal was different). The Medabots went on a rampage during the Ten Days of Darkness, which stopped when Henry was forced to kill his Medabot by destroying his medal.\nAt the end of the second season, it is revealed that Victor (a medafighter for Team Kenya and Warbandit's owner) was helping Dr. Meta-evil to get medals during the tournament. During the finals, Metabee and Warbandit continue to fight, even with their partners lost and their bodies damaged. It is during this event that Dr. Meta-evil starts his plan using Metabee and Warbandit's medals; trapping them both in a dream. However, Ikki manages to get Metabee to wake up from the dream, while the other medabots, free now, help Metabee to fight against Dr. Meta-evil. Ikki must also stop the plans of the nefarious \"RubberRobo Gang\".\nLater in the series, Medabots are found to be actually thousands of years old; remnants of an ancient civilization who called themselves Medalorians. The Medalorians were obsessed with war, and to become more effective warriors they fastened metal armor to themselves. However, their wars decimated the civilization, and the survivors coded their memories onto hexagonal pieces of metal. These, \"Medals\", cloned and mass-produced by the Medabot Corporation (a corporation founded by Dr. Aki), are the Medabot equivalent of a brain and soul. The original medals, referred to as rare medals, are kept in storage because of the extreme power they have.\n\n\n=== Medarot Damashii (Medabots Spirits) ===\nMedarot Damashii, a sequel to the original series, follows Ikki and Metabee, as they face a new challenge following the events of the original series.  Kam Kamazaki, a twelve-year-old boy, has designed one of the most dangerous medabots in the entire story, called Kilobots (or Death Medarot, in the Japanese version), who use the X-Medal. These Kilobots have no feelings, since the emotion part of the Medabot medal has been removed, and more strength parts have been replaced instead, and can break the rules in order to win a fight.  Because they have no personality, the Medaforce is useless against them.  In the first episode, Ikki loses a Robattle  to Ginkai and his Kilobot when it cheats and reloads. But he soon meets Nae, a Medabot mechanic and Dr. Aki's granddaughter, who gives Ikki new medaparts in order to defeat the kilobot through using a new feature called Action Mode (later Demolition Mode is introduced as well).  Throughout the season, Ikki, Erika and their new friend Zuru (who also masks as the Mystery Medafighter) battle several of Kam's friends and their Kilobots.  The Mystery Medfighter's ambition is to rid the world of Kilobots, with the help of his medabot Roks.  Eventually, Ginkai re-discovers the true spirit of medafighting and ceases being a rogue medafighter and returns to using Medabots. Eventually Kam realizes the error of his ways and stops trying to develop stronger and more dangerous Kilobots, choosing to remain with his Kilobot Blackbettle, who has a personality installed into her medal.\nThe series is often criticized for the removal of several supporting characters such as Henry/Hikaru Agata/Phantom Renegade/Space Medafighter X and Arcbeetle, Rokusho, Koji and Sumilidon, Rintaro and Kantaroth, Karin and Neutranurse, Victor and Warbandit, Mr. Referee, the Rubberrobo Gang and the Chick Salesman, as well as for the fact that many of the new Kilobots and Medabots are simply slightly modified versions of the original series without relation to the original characters: Roks (Rokusho), Exor (Sumilidon), Arcdash (Arcbeetle), Unitrix (Warbandit).\n\n\n== Characters ==\nIkki Tenryou (\u5929\u9818\u30a4\u30c3\u30ad Tenry\u014d Ikki), is a lively and easygoing boy, although a bit timid, he is the main protagonist of the series. At first Ikki is unable to afford a Medabot. But after finding a medal in a river, he manages to buy a model, which is named Metabee. However, the medal he found appears to be defective, as Metabee is short-tempered and disobedient. In spite of this, a strong bond grows between them after several robattles. Though Ikki is not a full-fledged Medafighter, he gradually matures through the Robattles he engages in. He is voiced by Michiru Yamazaki in the Japanese version, Samantha Reynolds in the English translation of the first series, and Julie Lemieux in the Spirits anime.\nMetabee (\u30e1\u30bf\u30d3\u30fc, Metab\u012b, whose name is a portmanteau of Metal Beetle) is the main antihero of the series, a Medabot belonging to Ikki Tenryou. Metabee is a beetle type Medabot, specializing in revolver tactics. He possesses a rare medal that allows him to access the Medaforce. Metabee is known to be a rebellious and arrogant Medabot who often causes problems due to his headstrong personality. He is often sarcastic to his owner Ikki, but he shares a close bond with him, and so Ikki trusts him deeply. In the English version he is voiced by Joseph Motiki.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nMost games in the series come in two versions: Kabuto (lit. Rhinoceros Beetle), in which your starting Medabot's design is based on a Japanese rhinoceros beetle (a \"KBT type\" Medabot), and Kuwagata, in which it is based on a stag beetle (\"KWG type\"). Differences beyond the starting Medabot also exist, such as which Medabot parts the player is able to collect, and minor story differences. Medarot R, Medabots Infinity, and the Parts Collection games were only titles to not have been released in two versions.\n\n\n==== Main series ====\nThe main series entries, except Medabots DS, are all numbered.\n\n\n==== Spinoffs and side games ====\nSeveral spinoffs have been produced, some sticking closer to the RPG formula of the main series while others branch out into other genres.\nFor Medarot 1, 2, R, and 3, supplementary games entitled Parts Collection were made. These are shorter games with less complicated stories, focusing mostly on battles. Their main draw is that the player is able to collect robot parts and other items within the Parts Collection games and transfer them to their respective main series titles.\n\n\n=== Manga ===\nWritten by Horumarin, the Medabots manga series was originally serialized in the Kodansha's children's magazine Comic BomBom from 1997 to 2003. Six series were published. The first series Medarot was published between 1997 and 1999 and compiled in three tank\u014dbon volumes. The second series entitled Medarot 2 was published between 1999 and 2000 and compiled in 4 volumes. This series was licensed for an English language release in North America by Viz Media under the title Medabots. the third series Medarot 3 was released between 2000 and 2001 and compiled in two volumes. The fourth series Medarot 4 was published in 2001 and compiled in two volumes. The fifth series Medarot 5 was published between 2001 and 2002 and compiled in two volumes. The sixth series Medarot G was released in 2003 and compiled in two volumes.\n\n\n=== Anime ===\n\nThe Medabots anime series was adapted from Medarot 2, with its robotic combat elements inspired by Plawres Sanshiro. Produced by NAS and TV Tokyo and animated by Bee Train, the fifty-two episode series originally aired on TV Tokyo from July 2, 1999 until June 30, 2000. A thirty-nine episode sequel to the anime series that was animated by Production I.G, Medarot Damashii (Unofficially known in English as Medabots Spirits) aired from July 7, 2000 to March 30, 2001.\nThe Japanese version has received a VHS and DVD release of the first series, while the second series has only received a VHS release. On January 29, 2010, a Region 2 boxset release known as Medabot DVD BOX 1 was released containing the first thirty episodes, with a second boxset on February 19 finishing with the last twenty-two episodes. Two boxsets for Damashii were released on December 30, 2010. This was the Production I.G series' very first DVD release.\nBoth series were licensed and localized into English by Canadian entertainment company Nelvana; the first series was divided into two American seasons. The first U.S. season originally aired on the Fox Broadcasting Company's Fox Kids block from September 1, 2001 to April 27, 2002. Medabots was Fox Kids highest-rated new series at the time. As a result of the sale of Fox Family Worldwide (the joint venture with Saban Entertainment that previously operated the Fox Kids program block) to The Walt Disney Company, Medabots would begin airing on ABC Family on March 4, 2002. The second U.S. season first aired on ABC Family from July 1 to November 2, 2002, while Damashii first aired on the network from September 13, 2003 to May 8, 2004 with later episodes aired as part of the Jetix program block. In Canada, the television series aired on YTV which, along with Nelvana, were owned by Corus Entertainment.\nUnder the license of Nelvana, the series was released on 12-volume VHS and DVD by ADV Films from 2002 to 2003 that ran throughout the first 52 episodes, along with the first three volumes re-released under ADV Kidz in their Essential Anime DVD lineup in 2005. Distribution was transferred to Shout! Factory, where they've released the first 26 episodes on a 4-DVD box set, that was released in early 2008. Announced at Otakon 2019, Discotek Media released the anime on SD Blu-ray, starting with the first 26 episodes of the English dub with optional closed captions on December 24, 2019. The company also announced plans to release the Japanese version in the future. On June 11, 2020, Justin Sevakis said Discotek Media were unable to find the masters for the English version of Medabots Spirits which has prevented the anime from being released on home video in North America. Discotek Media asked fans to help find the masters. On September 15, 2020, it was announced \u201cacceptable\u201d masters have been recovered and will have a physical release. It was released on May 25, 2021.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Japanese role-playing game franchises\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website\nMedabots in anime-paradijs Dutch\nMedabots (manga) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia\nMedabots at IMDb\nProject Rising Beetle localization campaign",

    "Early Gothic architecture": "Early Gothic is the style of architecture that appeared in northern France, Normandy and then England between about 1130 and the mid-13th century. It combined and developed several key elements from earlier styles, particularly from Romanesque architecture, including the rib vault, flying buttress, and the pointed arch, and used them in innovative ways to create structures, particularly Gothic cathedrals and churches, of exceptional height and grandeur, filled with light from stained glass windows. Notable examples of early Gothic architecture in France include the ambulatory and facade of Saint-Denis Basilica; Sens Cathedral (1140); Laon Cathedral; Senlis Cathedral; (1160) and most famously Notre-Dame de Paris (begun 1160).Early English Gothic was influenced by the French style, particularly in the new choir of Canterbury Cathedral, but soon developed it own particular characteristics, particularly an emphasis for length over height, and more complex and asymmetric floor plans, square rather than rounded east ends, and polychrome decoration, using Purbeck marble. Major examples are the nave and west front of Wells Cathedral, the choir of Lincoln Cathedral, and the early portions of Salisbury Cathedral.Early Gothic was succeeded in the early 13th century by a new wave of larger and taller buildings, with further technical innovations, in a style later known as High Gothic.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nFrench Gothic architecture was the result of the emergence in the 12th century of a powerful French state centered in the \u00cele-de-France. King Louis VI of France (1081\u20131137), had succeeded, after a long struggle, in bringing the barons of northern France under his control, and successfully defended his domain against attacks by the English King, Henry I of England (1100\u20131135). Under Louis and his successors, cathedrals were the most visible symbol of the unity of the French church and state. During the reign of Louis VI of France (1081\u20131137), Paris was the principal residence of the Kings of France, the Carolingian era Reims Cathedral the place of coronation, and the Abbey of Saint-Denis became the ceremonial burial place. The King and his successors lavishly supported the construction and enlargement of abbeys and cathedrals.\nThe Abbot of Saint-Denis, Suger, was not only a prominent religious figure but also first minister to Louis VI and Louis VII. He oversaw the royal administration when the King was absent on the Crusades. He commissioned the reconstruction of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, making it the first and most influential example of the new style in France.\n\n\n== Basilica of Saint-Denis ==\nThe Basilica of Saint-Denis was important because it was the burial place of the French Kings of the Capetian dynasty from the late 10th until the early 14th century. It attracted a very large number of pilgrims, attracted by the relics of Saint Denis, the patron saint of Paris. To accommodate the large number of pilgrims, Suger first constructed a new narthex and facade at the west end, with twin towers and a rose window in the center.\nThe most original and influential step made by Suger was the creation of the chevet, or east end, with radiating chapels. Here he used the pointed arch and rib vault in a new way, replacing the thick dividing walls with arched rib vaults poised on columns with sculpted capitals. Suger wrote that the new chevet was \"ennobled by the beauty of length and width.\" And \"the midst of the edifice was suddenly raised aloft by twelve columns\". He added that, when creating this feature, he was inspired by the ancient Roman columns he had seen in the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian and elsewhere in Rome. He described the finished work as \"a circular string of chapels, by virtue of which the whole church would shine with the wonderful and uninterrupted light of most luminous windows, pervading the interior beauty.\"Suger was an admirer of the doctrines of the early Christian philosopher John Scotus Eriugena (c. 810\u201387) and Dionysus, or the Pseudo-Areopagite, who taught that light was a divine manifestation, and that all things were \"material lights\", reflecting the infinite light of God himself. Therefore, stained glass became a way to create a glowing, unworldly light ideal for religious reflection.According to Suger, every aspect of the new apse architecture had a symbolic meaning. The twelve columns separating the chapels, he wrote, represented the twelve Apostles, while the twelve columns of the side aisles represented the minor prophets of the Old Testament.The Basilica, including the upper parts of the choir and the apse, were extensively modified into the Rayonnant style in the 1230s, but the original early Gothic ambulatory and chapels can still be seen.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Early French Gothic cathedrals ==\n\n\n=== Sens Cathedral ===\nFollowing the model of Saint-Denis, Sens Cathedral became the first complete Gothic cathedral. It was constructed between 1135 and 1164. It used the new six-part rib vault in the nave, giving the church exceptional width and height. Because the six-part vaults distributed the weight unevenly, the vaults were supported by alternating massive square piers and more slender round columns. It had a wide impact on the Gothic style not only in France, but also in England, because its master builder, William of Sens, was invited to England and introduced Early Gothic features to the reconstructed nave of Canterbury Cathedral.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Senlis Cathedral ===\nSenlis Cathedral was built between 1153 and 1191. Its length was limited by modest budget and by the placement of the building against the city wall. Like Sens cathedral, it was composed of a nave without a transept, flanked by a single collateral. The choir, like Saint-Denis, was surrounded by radiating chapels. The elevation had three levels, including large tribunes. Like Sens, Senlis Cathedral had alternating strong and weak piers to receive the uneven thrust from the six-part rib vaults. The church underwent considerable rebuilding in the 13th and 16th century, including a new tower and new interior decorations. Many of the early Gothic features are overladen with Flamboyant and later decoration.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Noyon Cathedral ===\nNoyon Cathedral, begun between 1150 and 1155, was the first of a series of famous Cathedrals to appear in Picardy, the prosperous region north of Paris. The city an important connection with French history, as the coronation site of Charlamagne and of the early French King Hugh Capet. The new cathedral still had many Romanesque features, including prominent transepts with rounded ends and deep galleries, but it introduced several Gothic innovations, including the fourth level, the triforium a narrow passageway between the ground-level gallery, the tribunes, and the top level clerestory, Noyon also used massive compound piers alternating with round columns, necessary because of the uneven weight distribution from the six-part vaults. The east end has five radiating chapels and three levels of windows, creating a created a dramatic flood of light into the nave.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Laon Cathedral ===\nLaon Cathedral (begun c. 1190), was built at the same time as Notre Dame de Paris, and was an equally large project, but had a strikingly different appearance. Laon was built upon a hilltop one hundred meters high, making it visible from a great distance. The hilltop imposed a special burden for the builders; all the stones had to be carried to the top of the hill in carts drawn by oxen. The oxen who did the work were honored by statues on the tower of the finished cathedral.Laon was also unusual because of its five towers; two on the west front, two on the transepts, and an octagonal lantern on crossing. Laon, like most early Gothic cathedrals, had four interior levels. Laon also had alternating octagonal and square piers supporting the nave, but these rested upon massive pillars made of dreamlike sections of stone, giving it greater harmony and a greater sensation of length. The new cathedral was unusual in form; The apse on the east was flat, not rounded, and The choir was exceptionally long, nearly as long as the nave. Another striking feature of Laon Cathedral were the three great rose windows, one on the west facade and two on the transepts. (Only the west and north windows still remain). Another unusual feature at Laon is lantern tower at the transept crossing, most likely inspired by the Norman Gothic abbey churches in Caen.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notre Dame de Paris ==\nNotre Dame de Paris was the largest of the Early Gothic cathedrals, and marked the summit of the Early Gothic in France. It was begun in 1163 by the Bishop Maurice de Sully with the intention of surpassing all other existing churches in Europe. The new cathedral was 122 meters long and 35 meters high, eleven meters higher than Laon Cathedral, the previous tallest church. It featured a central nave flanked by double collaterals, and a choir surrounded by a double ambulatory, without radiating chapels. (The current chapels were added between the buttresses in the 14th century).The builders covered the interior of the cathedral with six-part vaults, but unlike Sens and other the earlier cathedrals they did not use alternating piers and columns to support them. The vaults were supported instead by bundles of three uninterrupted slender columns which were received by rows massive pillars with capitals decorated with classical decoration. This gave the nave greater harmony.\nThe original elevation of Notre Dame had four levels, This was reduced to three in the 13th century, when it was decided that the interior was too dark, but it was returned to four levels around the transept during the restoration by Viollet-le-Duc.The flying buttress made its first appearance in Paris in the early 13th century, either at Notre Dame, or perhaps earlier in the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pres. The buttresses, in the form of half-arches, reached from the heavy buttresses outside the nave, over the top of the tribunes, and pressed directly against the upper walls of the nave, countering the outward thrust from the vaults. This made possible the installation of larger windows in the upper walls of the nave the buttresses.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Early Gothic in Normandy ==\nExperiments with Gothic features were also underway in Normandy in the late 11th and 12th centuries. In 1098 Lessay Abbey was given an early version of the pointed rib vault in the choir. The church of Saint-Pierre de Lisieux, begun in the 1170s, featured the more modern four-part rib vaults and flying buttresses. Other experiments with Gothic rib vaults and other features took place in Caen, in the churches of the two large royal abbeys churches, the Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen and the Abbey of Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Caen, But they remained essentially Norman Romanesque churches.Rouen Cathedral had notable early Gothic features, added when the interior was reconstructed from Romanesque to Gothic by archbishop Gautier de Coutances beginning in 1185. The new Gothic nave was given four levels, while the later choir had the newly fashionable three.\n\n\n== Early Gothic in England ==\n\n\n=== Early experiments - Durham Cathedral ===\nEnglish architects had experimented with early Gothic features. At Durham Cathedral, a Romanesque church, a traverse of the nave and lower aisle was made with an early variation a rib vault, a ribbed groin vault, or meeting place of two barrel vaults, with stone ribs. The ribbed groin vaults were installed in 1093\u201396 and were the first of their kind in Europe. As the work continued, the builders experimented with an even bolder variation, using pointed instead of rounded arches, to spread the weight outwards. The new pointed rib vaults were installed over the south transept and nave beginning in 1130. These were probably the first pointed arch rib vaults in Europe. The new vaults were not successful; the thin panels between the ribs were made of plastered rubble, and were too heavy and cracked, and in 1235 they had to be replaced. Newer and lighter versions of the rib vault, using small pieces of cut stone in the panels, rather than plastered rubble, were developed in Normandy and the Ile-de-France. Pointed Rib vaults did not fully take hold in England until the second half of the 12th century.\n\n\n=== Canterbury Cathedral ===\nOne of the first major buildings in England to use the new style was Canterbury Cathedral. A fire destroyed the mainly Romanesque choir in September 1174, and leading architects from England and France were invited to offer plans for its reconstruction. The winner of this competition was a French master builder, William of Sens, who had been involved in the construction of Sens Cathedral, the first complete Gothic cathedral in France. Many limitations were put upon William of Sens by the monks who ran the cathedral. He was not allowed to replace entirely the original Norman church, and had to fit his new structure on the old crypt and within the surviving outer Norman walls. Nonetheless, he achieved a strikingly original sculpture, showing elements inspired by Notre-Dame de Paris and Laon Cathedral. Following the French model, he used six-part rib vaults, pointed arches, supporting columns with carved acanthus leaf decoration, and a semi-circular ambulatory. However, other elements were purely English, such as the use of dark Purbeck marble to create decorative contrasts with the pale stone brought from Normandy. The work was described by a monk and chronicler, Gervase of Canterbury. Contrasting the old with the new choir. He wrote: \"There, the arches and everything else was plain, or sculpted with an axe and not with a chisel. But here almost throughout is appropriate sculpture. There used to be no marble shafts, but here are innumerable ones. There in the circuit round the choir, the vaults were plain, but here they are arch-ribbed and have key-stones.\" William of Sens fell from a scaffolding in 1178 and was seriously injured, and returned to France, where he died, and his work was continued by an English architect, William the Englishman, who constructed the Trinity Chapel in the apse and the Corona in the east end, which were monuments to Thomas Becket, who had been murdered in the cathedral. The new structure had many French features, such as the doubled columns in the Trinity chapel, and piers replaced by Purbeck-marble wall shafts. But it also retained many specifically English features, such as a great variety in the level and placement of the spaces; the Trinity chapel, for example is sixteen steps above the Choir). It also retaining rather than eliminated the transepts - Canterbury had two. Early English Gothic put an emphasis on great length; Canterbury was doubled in length between 1096 and 1130.One reason for the differences between French and English Gothic was that French Benedictine abbey-churches usually put different functions into separate buildings, while in England they were usually combined in the same structure. Similar complicated multifunctional designs were found not only in Canterbury, but in the abbey-churches of Bath, Coventry, Durham, Ely, Norwich, Rochester, Winchester and Worcester.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n=== The Cistercian abbeys ===\nAnother notable form of early English Gothic architecture was that of the Cistercian monasteries. The Cistercian order had been formed in 1098 as a reaction against the opulence and ornament of the Benedictine order and its monasteries. The architecture of the Cistercians was based upon simplicity and functionality. All decoration was forbidden. The Cistercian monasteries were in remote locations, far from the cities. They were closed in 1539 during the reign of Henry VIII, and now are picturesque ruins. Examples include Kirkstall Abbey (c. 1152); Roche Abbey (c. 1172), and Fountains Abbey (c. 1132) all in Yorkshire.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Wells Cathedral ===\nWells Cathedral, (built between 1185\u20131200 and modified until 1240) is another leading example of the early English style. It borrowed some aspects, such as its elevation, from the French style, but gave precedence to strong horizontals, such as the triforium, rather than the dominant vertical elements, such as wall shafts, of the French style. The piers were composed of as many as twenty-four shafts, adding another unusual decorative effect. The north porch, built in 1210\u201315, and especially the west front (1220\u20131240) had a particularly novel decorative effect. The screen facade of the west front is filled with nearly four hundred carved and painted stone figure, and is made more impressive by two flanking towers, attached to but not part of the body of the church. This arrangement was adapted by other English cathedrals, including Salisbury Cathedral and Exeter Cathedral.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Salisbury Cathedral ===\nSalisbury Cathedral (1220\u20131260) is another example of the mature Early English Gothic. Salisbury is best known for its famous crossing tower and spire, added in the 14th century, but its complex plan, with two sets of transepts, a projecting north porch and a rectangular east end, is a classic example of the early English Gothic. It was a distinct contrast from the French Amiens Cathedral, begun the same year, with its simple apse on east and its minimal transepts. The nave has strong horizontal lines created by the contrast of the dark Purbeck marble columns. The Lady Chapel of Salisbury has extremely slender pillars of Purbeck marble supporting the vaults, shows the diversity and harmony of mature English Early Gothic, entering the period of Decorated Gothic.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Lincoln Cathedral ===\nLincoln Cathedral (rebuilt from the Norman style beginning in 1192), is the best example of the fully mature early Gothic style. The master-builder, Geoffrey de Noiers, was French, but he constructed a church with distinct non-French features; double transepts, an elongated nave, complexity of interior space, and a more lavish use of decorative features. St. Hugh's Choir, named after the French-born monk St. Hugh of Lincoln, was a good example. The choir was covered with a rib vault in which most of the ribs had a purely decorative role. In addition to the functional ribs, it featured extra ribs called tiercerons, which did not lead to the central point of the vault, but to a point along the ridge rib on the crown of the vault. They were put together in lavish designs, which gave the resulting ceiling the nickname \"The crazy vault.\"Another distinctive English element introduced at Lincoln was the use of s the blind arcade (also known as a blank arcade) in the decoration of Hugh's chapel. Two layers of arcades with pointed arches are attached to the walls, giving a theatrical effect of three dimensions. This element is enhanced by the use of different color stone for the thin columns; ribs of white limestone for the lower columns and black Purbeck marble for the upper portions.A third feature important feature of Lincoln was the thick or double-shell wall. This was an Anglo-Romanesque feature, which earlier had been in used in Romanesque structures of Caen, and in Durham and Winchester Cathedral. Instead of being supported only by flying buttresses, the vaults receive additional support from the thicker walls of the gallery over the aisles. This allowed a considerably wider span across the nave, and also meant that the vaults could have additional purely decorative ribs, as in the \"Crazy vault\".\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Plans ===\nThe plans of the early Gothic cathedrals in France were usually in the form of a Greek cross, and were relatively simple. Sens Cathedral, the first in France, was a good example; A facade with three portals and two towers; a long nave with collateral aisles; a rather long choir, a very short transept, and a rounded apse with a double ambulatory and radiating chapels. Variations on this plan were used in most early French cathedrals, including Noyon Cathedral and Notre Dame de Paris.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe plans of the early English Gothic cathedrals were usually longer and much more complex, with additional transepts, attached chapels, external towers, and usually a rectangular west end. The choirs were often as long as the nave. The form expressed the multiple activities often going on simultaneously in the same building.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Elevations ===\nAt the time of the early Gothic, the flying buttress was not yet in common use, and buttresses were placed directly close to or directly against the walls. The walls had to be reinforced by additional width. The early Gothic churches in France typically had four elevations or levels in the nave: the aisle arcade on the ground floor; the gallery arcade, a passageway, above it; the blind triforium, a narrower passageway, and the clerestory, a wall with larger windows, just under the vaults. These multiple levels added to the width and thus the stability of the walls, before the flying buttress was commonly used. This was the system used at Sens Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral and originally at Notre Dame de Paris. At Notre-Dame the triforium had small rose windows, rather than a passageway.The introduction of a simpler four-part rib vault and especially the flying buttress meant that the walls could be thinner and higher, with more room for windows. By the end of the period, the triforium level was usually eliminated, and larger windows filled the space.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Vaults ===\nThe rib vault was a characteristic feature of Gothic architecture from the beginning. It was the result of a search for a way to build stone roofs on churches that could not catch fire but would not be too heavy. Variations of rib vaults had been used in Islamic and Romanesque architecture, often to support domes. The rib vault had thin stone ribs which carried the vaulted surface of thin panels. Unlike the earlier barrel vault, where the weight of the vault pressed down directly onto the walls, the arched ribs of a rib vault had a pointed arch, a rib which directed the weight outwards and downwards to specific points, usually piers and columns in the nave below, or outward to the walls, where it was countered by buttresses. The panels between the ribs were made of small pieces of stone, and were much lighter than the earlier barrel vaults. A primitive form, a ribbed groin vault, with round arches, was used at Durham Cathedral, and then, in the course of building, was improved with pointed arches in about 1096. Other variations had been used at Lessay Abbey in Normandy at about the same time.The first Gothic rib vaults were divided by the ribs into six compartments. A six-part vault could cover two sections of the nave. Two pointed arches crossed diagonally and were supported by an intermediate arch, which crossed the nave from side to side. The weight was carried downward by thin columns from the corners of the vault to the alternating heavy piers and thinner columns in the nave below. The weight was distributed unevenly; the piers received the greater weight from diagonal arches, while the columns took the lesser weight from the intermediate arch. This system was used successfully at the Basilica of Saint-Denis, Noyon Cathedral, Laon Cathedral, and Notre-Dame de Paris.\nA simpler and stronger vault with just four compartments was developed at the end of the period by eliminating the intermediate arch. As a result, the piers or columns below all received an equal load, and could have the same size and appearance, giving greater harmony to the nave. This system was used increasingly at the end of the Early Gothic period.\nMore elaborate rib vaults were introduced in England later in the period, at Lincoln Cathedral. These had additional purely decorative ribs called the lierne and the tierceron, in ornate designs like stars and fans, They were the work of Geoffrey de Noiers, a French or French-Normand master-builder who between 1192 and 1200 designed St. Hugh's choir, completed in 1208. The ribs were designed so that the bays slightly offset each other, giving them the nickname of \"Crazy vaults\". De Noiers was succeeded at Lincoln by Alexander the Mason, who designed the tierceron star vaulting in the cathedral's nave. at Lincoln Cathedral.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Flying buttress ===\nVariations of the flying buttress existed before the Gothic period, but Gothic architects developed them to a high degree of sophistication. By counterbalancing the thrust against the upper walls from the rib vaults, they made possible the great height, thin walls and large upper windows of the Gothic cathedrals. The early Gothic buttresses were placed close to the walls, and were columns of stone with a short arch to the upper level, between the windows. They were often topped by stone pinnacles both for decoration, and to make them even heavier.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Sculpture ===\nThe most important sculptural decoration of early Gothic cathedrals was found over and around the portals, or doorways, on the tympanum and sometimes also on the columns. Following the model of Romanesque churches, these depicted the Holy Family and Saints. Following the tradition of Romanesque sculpture, the figures were usually stiff, straight, simple forms, and often elongated. As the period advanced, the sculpture became more naturalistic. The floral and vegetal sculpture of the capitals of columns in the nave was more realistic, showing a close observation of nature.One of the finest examples of early Gothic sculpture is the tympanum over the royal portal of Chartres Cathedral (1145\u20131245), which survived a fire that destroyed much of the early Cathedral.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Stained glass ===\nStained glass had existed for centuries, and was used in Romanesque churches, but it became was a particularly important feature of early Gothic architecture. The Abbot Suger commissioned stained glass windows for the Basilica of Saint-Denis to fill the ambulatory and chapels with what he considered to be divine light. The stained glass windows of Saint-Denis and other Early Gothic churches had a particular intensity of color, partly because the glass was thicker and used more color, and partly because the early windows were small, and their light had a more striking contrast with the dark interiors of the churches and cathedrals.\nThe process of making the windows was described by the monk Theophilus Presbyter in the early 12th century. The glass and the windows were made by different craftsmen, usually at different locations. The molten glass was coloured with metal oxides; cobalt for blue, copper for red, iron for green, manganese for purple and antimony for yellow. When molten, it was blown into a bubble, formed into a tubular shape, cut at the ends to make a cylinder, then slit and flattened while it was still hot. It ranged in thickness from 3 to 8 mm (0.12 to 0.31 in). A full-size drawing of the window was made on a large table, and then pieces of colored glass were \"grozed\", or cracked off the sheet, and assembled on the table. The details of the windows were then painted on in vitreous enamel, then fired. The glass pieces were fit into grooved pieces of lead, which were soldered together, and sealed with putty to make them waterproof, to complete the window.The rose window was a particular feature of early Gothic. They had been used in Romanesque architecture, such as the two small windows on the facade of Pomposa Abbey in Italy (early 10th century), but they became more important and complex in the Gothic period. In the 12th century, according to Bernard of Clairvaux, writing at that time, the rose was the symbol of the Virgin Mary, and had a prominent place on the facades of the cathedrals named for her, such as Notre-Dame de Paris, whose west rose window dates from 1220.The rose windows of the Early Gothic churches were composed of plate tracery, a geometric pattern of openings in stone over the central portal.  Early examples included the rose on the west facade of the Basilica of Saint-Denis (though the present window is not original), and the early rose window on the west front of Chartres Cathedral. Other examples are the rose on the west front of Laon Cathedral and Notre Dame de Mantes (1210)  York Minster has what is believed to be the oldest existing stained glass window in England, a Tree of Jesse (1170).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nGothic architecture\nGothic cathedrals and churches\nHigh Gothic\nRayonnant\nFlamboyant\nFrench Gothic architecture\nEnglish Gothic architecture\nArchitecture of Normandy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDucher, Robert (2014).

    "Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School": "Mechanicsburg Area Senior High is a secondary school located on 500 South Broad Street in the borough of Mechanicsburg, west of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The school is part of the Mechanicsburg Area School District.\n\n\n== Communities ==\nMechanicsburg Area Senior High (MASH), which accepts students ranging from grade 9\u201312, serves several communities, including the Boroughs of Mechanicsburg and Shiremanstown, Upper Allen Township, and the villages of Grantham and Bowmansdale.\nThe students begin at the Kindergarten Academy then proceed to one of the elementary schools: Elmwood, Shepherdstown (grades 1-2) / Upper Allen (grades 3-5), Northside, or Broad Street (All 1-5).  They then progress to Mechanicsburg Middle School (6-8), and then Mechanicsburg High School (9-12).\n\n\n== School information and history ==\nMechanicsburg High School was founded and held its first commencement in 1875, with one graduate.\nMechanicsburg High School has been located in three different buildings since its foundation. The Simpson Street School (now a luxury apartment complex) was completed in 1872 and was expanded upon in 1929. In 1957, the school had expanded past capacity, and a new building was built along Elmwood Avenue. The Elmwood Avenue school served as the high school for only 12 years, as the current building on 500 South Broad Street was built and completed in 1969. The Elmwood building was converted to be used as an Intermediate School, and in 2005 was renovated again to be used as an Elementary School. In the mid-1980s, a wing was added to the current building to suit capacity needs. In 2002, the current building underwent extensive renovations.\nOn July 6, 2010, then-Governor Ed Rendell publicly signed Pennsylvania's $28 billion budget at Elmwood Elementary.The Wildcat\nThe school's mascot was first referenced as the \"Wildcat\" in a 1937 edition of the school newspaper, The Torch. Prior to this, Mechanicsburg's athletic teams were referenced as the \"Steel-and-Maroon\" or the \"Maroon-and-Steel\". No information is currently known as to why the school chose a wildcat as its mascot or the exact date when it was chosen.\n\n\n== Academic achievement ==\nRankings:\nIn 2014, Mechanicsburg was ranked 49th in the state of Pennsylvania (1,869th nationally) by US News & World Report and was awarded \"silver medal\" status. In 2013, Mechanicsburg was ranked 68th in Pennsylvania, and 2,239th nationally.Rankings in the Pittsburgh Business Times, based on the last three years of student academic performance on the PSSAs for math, reading, writing, and science:\n2013 - 79\n2012 - 77\n2011 - 91\n2010 - 90\n2009 - 103\n2008 - 96\n2007 - 113Graduation rate:\n\n2012 \u2013 97%\n2011 \u2013 93%\n2010 \u2013 98%\n2009 \u2013 89%\n2008 \u2013 90%\n2007 \u2013 90%PSSA results:\nMechanicsburg Area Senior High's Graduation Rate and Standardized Testing (PSSA) results are provided to the public by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n\nCollege remediation:\nAccording to a Pennsylvania Department of Education study released in January 2009, 33% of the Mechanicsburg Area High School graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges.  Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years. Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English.\nDual enrollment:\nThe high school offers the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program which permits students to earn deeply discounted college credits while still enrolled in high school. Over 400 school districts in Pennsylvania offer this state-funded program. Additionally, the high school does offer joint programs with the Cumberland-Perry Vocational-Technical School, the Capitol Area School for the Arts, and offers a career internship program for seniors, allowing for work experience to be taken for elective course credit.\nAdvanced Placement:\nMechanicsburg offers several Advanced Placement courses and exams to students, which can be taken for potential college credit. In the 2008-2009 school year, Mechanicsburg students took AP exams in Art, Studio Drawing, Biology, Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Chemistry, Computer Science A, English Language & Composition, English Literature & Composition, European History, French, Latin: Vergil, Music Theory, Physics B, Psychology and Spanish.Graduation project:\nBy law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district.\n\n\n== Extracurriculars ==\nThe district offers a wide variety of clubs, activities and sports.\nBy Pennsylvania law, all K\u201312 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home-schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.In April 2010, the school board chose to add 25% funding for water polo and boys lacrosse at the same time they cut five teacher positions. However, as of the 2011-2012 budget, those programs are not funded by the district and never were.In the 2018-19 school year, there was a controversy about passing out Bibles to friends during free time, which resulted in a federal lawsuit and an eventually compromise. The story was picked up by the national media.\n\n\n=== Clubs ===\nMechanicsburg High School sponsors a variety of extracurricular clubs and teams focusing on academic development. As of the 2012-13 school year, the high school sponsored chapters of the National Honor Society, National Art Honor Society, National French Honor Society, National German Honor Society, National Latin Honor Society, National Spanish Honor Society, and Tri-M. Students also annually publish the Muse literary and arts magazine, the monthly Torch newspaper, and the annual Artisan yearbook. Students can compete with interscholastic academic teams in Quiz Bowl, Speech, Memory, and Math. In 2013, the Memory Team won the High School National Championship of the USA Memory Championship in New York City.Mechanicsburg hosts a variety of fund-raising and social awareness events throughout the school year. Lift For Life, a charity weightlifting competition is held in early March at the High School to raise money for kidney cancer research, in honor of Don Shirley, a Mechanicsburg High School baseball coach who died of kidney cancer. Mechanicsburg also sponsors a chapter of Key Club.\n\n\n=== Music program ===\n\n\n==== Marching band ====\nThe Mechanicsburg High School Marching Band is the school's marching band . They are called the Wildcats. Local residents, members, and fans associated with the group also refer to them as the \"Maroon Machine.\"\n\nHistoryMechanicsburg has a rich marching band tradition going back to 1929. They began competing in the Tournament of Bands in 1988.\n\n1988: First win at Tournament of Bands Chapter VI championships.\n1989: First appearance at Atlantic Coast Championships, placed 2nd in Group 3.  The show included music from Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring, Candide and Niner Two.\n1992: First win at Atlantic Coast Championships, competing in Group 4.  This elaborate show featured songs from Disney's Beauty and the Beast, complete with set pieces, tarps, and dancing characters.  Characters included in the show were Mrs. Potts, Lumiere, Cogsworth, and Chip.  The band edged out Carlisle High School (Carlisle, PA), who finished in 2nd place, to bring home this trophy. The band director at this time was Michael Snyder.\n2003: This was a successful year for the band which won every competition it entered up to the Tournament of Bands Atlantic Coast championship.\n2005: The 2005 show was entitled \"A Suite For Winter\". The band claimed 1st place prize on the night of November 12, 2005 at Lackawanna County Stadium in Moosic, PA. The band won first place in Group 3 with a score of 98.80, the highest score ever in TOB history (tying Mechanicsburg's 98.80 Group 4 output in 1994). The show also earned the caption awards for high music, visual, and brass.\n2006: The band successfully defended its title on November 12, 2006 when they again won the TOB Group 3 Atlantic Coast Championships. Their show, entitled \"Flight\" earned a score of 98.05. In addition to the first-place finish, they were awarded the trophies for high music, visual, percussion, and auxiliary.\n2007: On November 10, 2007 the MASH band performed their 2007 show, \"An Irish Heritage\" and won their third title in a row at the TOB Group 3 Atlantic Coast Championships at the Delaware State University's Alumni Stadium in Dover, DE with a record-tying score of 98.80 (Set by themselves, twice). They were additionally awarded for high music, visual, auxiliary, and brass.\n2008:On November 16, 2008 at J. Birney Crum Stadium in Allentown, PA, the band performed their show \"Above the Clouds\" and won their fourth straight Group 3 TOB ACC title with a score of 97.35. The class of 2009 subsequently became the first Mechanicsburg graduates to ever win four straight championships. The band also took home awards for high music, visual, brass and percussion. This was the band's final year under director Dane Hildebrand. Hildebrand finished his 10th year as Mechanicsburg's director on high note, winning for the sixth time.\n2009: The band won its fifth consecutive Group 3 TOB Atlantic Coast Championship at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, PA on November 1, 2009. The Sunday night performance of their field show \"Earth\" earned them a score of 96.85 along with high music, visual, percussion, and auxiliary. It was their 11th ACC victory in school history, having already won Group IV in 1992, '94, '95, and '96, and Group III in '99, 2000, '05, '06, '07, and '08. They continue to hold the Group III high-score record (98.80 in 2005 and 2007) and the Group IV record (98.80 in 1994). These three 98.80s also stand as the overall highest scores received in the history of Tournament Of Bands. It was the first season with new band director Michael Drobish.\n2010: Back in Group 4 competition for the first time since 1997, the 2010 MASH band were not able to stretch their winning streak to 6 years.  With a score of 95.25, their show \"Ice\" earned them a 3rd-place finish and high auxiliary at Atlantic Coast Championships at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, PA.\n2011: Changing back to Group 3, the MASH band also had a change of director in 2011.  Ben Goldsborough, who was previously band director at nearby Cedar Cliff High School, became the new leader of the Mechanicsburg Marching Band program.  In a transition year, the band placed 3rd again at Atlantic Coast Championships at Hersheypark Stadium with a score of 94.40 as well as winning the high auxiliary award for the fifth time in six years.  94.40 is the lowest Atlantic Coast Championship score ever in MASH's TOB history.\n2012: In its second season under Goldsborough's direction, the 2012 MASH band performed their new-look show titled \"The Factory\" at Atlantic Coast Championships in Hershey, PA and regained their place at the top of TOB's Group 3, earning a score of 97.70 as well as taking home the captions for high visual, percussion, auxiliary, and brass, while sharing the high music award with local rivals Camp Hill High School.  In addition to competing in Tournament of Bands, the 2012 MASH band competed in another marching band circuit, USBands (formerly known as USSBA).  The band took first place at a USBands competition at Cedar Cliff High School and performed at the USBands National Championships on November 10, 2012 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ. The marching band took third place with a score of 96.388.\n2015: Now at Group 5 Open in the USBands circuit, and Group 4 Open in TOB, the 2015 MASH band performed a new show called \"Nightscapes\" at the TOB Chapter 6 Championships. It was at Cedar Cliff High School in West Shore Stadium, but they lost to the West Shore Marching Band. They went to USBands National Championships, and placed 1st in Group 5 Open. Not only did the band win the Overall Group 5 Championship, but they also brought home awards for Outstanding Colorguard, High Visual, and High Music. The band was directed by Ben Goldsborough.\n2016: The band's show in 2016 was entitled \"Red Riding Hood.\"  It put a dark twist on the classic fairy tale in which Red is the leader of the wolf pack. They were still in Group 4 Open in TOB and Group 5 Open in USBands. They placed first in TOB Chapter 6 Championships and USBands State Championships, then 2nd in USBands National Championships.\n2017: In 2017 the band suffered a loss in numbers and was demoted to group 4-Open in USBands. The MASH Marching Band\u2019s 2017 show was titled \u201cThe Heist.\u201d It told the story of the Gardner Museum Heist. They placed 8th out of 16 in their MetLife performance.\n2018: The 2018 show is titled \"Into the Deep Unknown\". It describes going out to sea and adventure away from home. At USBands State Championships, located at West Chester University, Mechanicsburg won 1st place in Group 5 Open with the title of best percussion. One week later, at Mid-Atlantic Regionals in Ijamsville, Maryland, Mechanicsburg won second in Group 5 during prelims, and went on to win 2nd out of 12 bands at finals with a score of 98.100. They finished their season at the USBands Open Class National Championships at MetLife Stadium, where they were placed 5th in Group 5 with a score of 95.438.Atlantic Coast ChampionshipsTheir scores at the Atlantic Coast Championships are:\n*TOB record high score\n**Co-winner\n\n\n==== Indoor Percussion and Colorguard ====\nMechanicsburg is noted for its indoor percussion ensemble, a competitor in the Winter Guard International and TIA Percussion circuit. In 2012, they won 2nd place at the WGI tournament in Dayton, Ohio with a score of 96.10.\nIn 2006, they won 1st at KIDA Championships, and in 2007, they were promoted to the World class in the WGI circuit. And in 2008, the Percussion Ensemble placed 3rd in the TIA Percussion circuit at Wildwoods, New Jersey.\nMechanicsburg Indoor Guard was started in 1997 by Kristy Templin and Bart Sword.

When the guard competed at world championships, they placed 4th with a 93.3, missing the bronze by three tenths of a point. In 2010, the guard began to compete in Scholastic World, the highest class of competition. Locally, the Color Guard has dominated the Keystone Indoor Drill Association's Blue Class for years, however recently a new Platinum Class has been created for colorguards of this caliber. In 2011, Sal Salas, Joe Heininger, Kristy Templin and Jeff Kahley joined together to design the shows. The color guard placed 2nd in the Nation in Scholastic A and brought home the silver medal. As a result of their placement, the color guard was promoted to the Open Class Division. In 2012, they were a semi-finalist in the Scholastic Open Class Division.\n\n\n==== Musical Theatre ====\nMASH is well known in the mid-state area for its musical theatre department, which has been under the leadership of Eric Dundore for more than two decades.

    "5,000,000": "One million (1,000,000), or one thousand thousand, is the natural number following 999,999 and preceding 1,000,001. The word is derived from the early Italian millione (milione in modern Italian), from mille, \"thousand\", plus the augmentative suffix -one.It is commonly abbreviated in British English as m (not to be confused with the metric prefix \"m\", milli, for 10\u22123), M, MM (\"thousand thousands\", from Latin \"Mille\"; not to be confused with the Roman numeral MM = 2,000), mm (not to be confused with millimetre), or mn in financial contexts.In scientific notation, it is written as 1\u00d7106 or 106. Physical quantities can also be expressed using the SI prefix mega (M), when dealing with SI units; for example, 1 megawatt (1 MW) equals 1,000,000 watts.\nThe meaning of the word \"million\" is common to the short scale and long scale numbering systems, unlike the larger numbers, which have different names in the two systems.\nThe million is sometimes used in the English language as a metaphor for a very large number, as in \"Not in a million years\" and \"You're one in a million\", or a hyperbole, as in \"I've walked a million miles\" and \"You've asked a million-dollar question\".\n1,000,000 is also the square of 1000 and also the cube of 100.\n\n\n== Visualizing one million ==\nEven though it is often stressed that counting to precisely a million would be an exceedingly tedious task due to the time and concentration required, there are many ways to bring the number \"down to size\" in approximate quantities, ignoring irregularities or packing effects.\n\nInformation:  Not counting spaces, the text printed on 136 pages of an Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, or 600 pages of pulp paperback fiction contains approximately one million characters.\nLength: There are one million millimetres in a kilometre, and roughly a million sixteenths of an inch in a mile (1 sixteenth = 0.0625). A typical car tire might rotate a million times in a 1,900-kilometre (1,200 mi) trip, while the engine would do several times that number of revolutions.\nFingers: If the width of a human finger is 22 mm (7\u20448 in), then a million fingers lined up would cover a distance of 22 km (14 mi). If a person walks at a speed of 4 km/h (2.5 mph), it would take them approximately five and a half hours to reach the end of the fingers.\nArea: A square a thousand objects or units on a side contains a million such objects or square units, so a million holes might be found in less than three square yards of window screen, or similarly, in about one half square foot (400\u2013500 cm2) of bed sheet cloth. A city lot 70 by 100 feet is about a million square inches.\nVolume: The cube root of one million is one hundred, so a million objects or cubic units is contained in a cube a hundred objects or linear units on a side. A million grains of table salt or granulated sugar occupies about 64 mL (2.3 imp fl oz; 2.2 US fl oz), the volume of a cube one hundred grains on a side. One million cubic inches would be the volume of a small room 8+1\u20443 feet long by 8+1\u20443 feet wide by 8+1\u20443 feet high.\nMass: A million cubic millimetres (small droplets) of water would have a volume of one litre and a mass of one kilogram. A million millilitres or cubic centimetres (one cubic metre) of water has a mass of a million grams or one tonne.\nWeight: A million 80-milligram (1.2 gr) honey bees would weigh the same as an 80 kg (180 lb) person.\nLandscape: A pyramidal hill 600 feet (180 m) wide at the base and 100 feet (30 m) high would weigh about a million short tons.\nComputer: A display resolution of 1,280 by 800 pixels contains 1,024,000 pixels.\nMoney: A USD bill of any denomination weighs 1 gram (0.035 oz). There are 454 grams in a pound. One million USD bills would weigh 1 megagram (1,000 kg; 2,200 lb) or 1 tonne (just over 1 short ton).\nTime: A million seconds, 1 megasecond, is 11.57 days.In Indian English and Pakistani English, it is also expressed as 10 lakh. Lakh is derived from lak\u1e63a for 100,000 in Sanskrit. \n\n\n== Selected 7-digit numbers (1,000,001\u20139,999,999) ==\n\n\n=== 1,000,001 to 1,999,999 ===\n1,000,003 \u2013 Smallest 7-digit prime

The club was founded in 1919, thus being the oldest active football club in Tunisia and its traditional colours are red and yellow. They play in Stade Olympique de Rad\u00e8s. The club is mostly known for its football team, which is currently playing in the Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 and is one of the most popular clubs in Tunisia and is considered one of the continent's giants.\nEsp\u00e9rance is the most successful Tunisian club; domestically, they have won 31 Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1 titles, 15 Tunisian Cup and 6 Tunisian Super Cup, all of them national records. Esp\u00e9rance won a total of 52 domestic trophies, more than any other Tunisian football club.\nAt international level, Esp\u00e9rance has won a total of 13 titles, with 8 organized by Confederation of African Football, including 4 CAF Champions League titles, 1 CAF Cup title, 1 CAF Cup Winners' Cup title, 1 CAF Super Cup title and one Afro-Asian Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Founding and early years ===\nThe club was founded in Bab Souika which is one of the historic neighborhoods of the capital Tunis by Mohamed Zouaoui and H\u00e9di Kallel as an act of resistance against the French colonization . The club was named 'Esp\u00e9rance' after the name of the coffeehouse where the founders used to meet each other often, the caf\u00e9 named 'Caf\u00e9 de L'Esp\u00e9rance' (Arabic: \u0645\u0642\u0647\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u062c\u064a).They appealed to Louis Montassier, a member of the French administration, to obtain authorization from the colonial authorities, given the regulations of the time which required that all foundations and clubs must be chaired by a Frenchman. EST is officially registered on 15 January 1919.\nThe first colours were green and white. In 1920, the club recruited a young high school student, Chedly Zouiten, who provided a set of jersey with vertical red and yellow bands, now becoming the club's colors. Zouiten became a member of the club's management committee in 1923 before becoming president in 1931. On 29 June 1930, Habib Bourguiba was part of the club's management committee.\nUnder Zouiten's tenure, which lasts more than three decades, Esp\u00e9rance was nearly on the verge of abandonment until promotion to the honorary division of the League of Tunisia in 1936. Esp\u00e9rance also manages to reach the final of the Tunisian Cup but Stade Gaulois manages to win. Three years after its failure against the Stade Gaulois, Esperance won the Tunisian Cup (1939) against the Etoile Sportive du Sahel (3\u20131), his first ever triumph and title. It was in 1955 that Esperance qualified to represent the Tunisian League in the North African championship. In the knockout match, two of the five teams are drawn at random to compete against each other and the winner immediately qualifies for the semi-finals. The Wydad of the Moroccan League and the Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis faced each other; the meeting took place in Tunis on 15 May 1955, the Tunisian club losing on the score of 2 goals to 1.\nBetween the start of the Second World War and independence (1956), the squad quality improved, especially since the club received the reinforcement of Algerian players like Abdelaziz Ben Tifour. The French, Italian and Maltese clubs which until then dominated football in Tunisia, had to compete with a \"indigenous\" club.  \n\n\n=== After the independence ===\nWhen independence was proclaimed, Esp\u00e9rance stands out as a leader club in the country. The titles (champion in 1958 and 1960 and winner of the cup in 1957) but also the style of play, resolutely spectacular and turned towards the offensive, explain the popular enthusiasm. Attacking football was abandoned in 1963 following the passage of Ben Azzedine as coach. The latter opts for very rigorous Italian-style defensive principles.\nIn 1971, violent riots occurred in Stade El Menzah by Esp\u00e9rance supporters following the final lost against the Club Sportive Sfaxien (historic goal of Abdelwahed Trabelsi in the first minute of the game). The authorities then sanctioned Esperance and withdraw the right to play in the first division. The football section of the Esp\u00e9rance was dissolved while the team was one day away from being crowned as champions.\nIn 1977, Esp\u00e9rance iconic playmaker Tarak Dhiab won the African Ballon d'Or, the only Tunisian football player to have received the trophy to date.\n\n\n=== Slim Chiboub era and national dominance (1989\u20132004) ===\nSlim Chiboub, son-in-law of president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, took charge of the club in 1989. Quickly, he kept one of his promises with a double in 1990\u20131991, which increased his popularity. In 1993, he won several international and local titles and signed the striker of the Zambian national team, Kenneth Malitoli. Esp\u00e9rance also won its first regional cup, the Arab Club Champions Cup, becoming the first Tunisian team to do so in 1993. The following year, the club won its first CAF Champions League at the expense of defending champion Zamalek. In 1995, EST won the CAF Super Cup as well as the Afro-Asian Cup, becoming the first Tunisian club win all possible continental titles. Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis won ten Tunisian league titles, including seven successive between 1998 and 2004 and set a new national record.Esp\u00e9rance Sportive de Tunis was designated by IFFHS as the World Club of the Month for July 2004.\n\n\n=== Hamdi Meddeb era and sustained success(2007\u2013present) ===\n\nBetween 2005 and 2007, Aziz Zouhir led the club which won the double (championship and cup) in 2006. In 2007 Hamdi Meddeb took charge of the club. He focused on boosting Esperance financially and recruiting African and Tunisian talents. This is how, in a few years, Esperance signed many promising players like Michael Eneramo, Harrison Afful, Youssef Msakni, Mejdi Traoui and Yannick N'Djeng.\nThe 2010\u20132011 season was one of the most successful in the history of the club when Esp\u00e9rance completed a historical treble by winning the League, National Cup and the African Champions League, under coach Nabil Ma\u00e2loul. Following this success, a new committee chaired by Hamdi Meddeb was elected on 25 September 2011 for a three-year term. However, Ma\u00e2loul resigned after a sixth place in the FIFA Club World Cup. However, the team lost the 2012 CAF Champions League final to Al Ahly, and the team star Youssef Msakni was sold to Qatari club Lekhwiya for 23 million Tunisian Dinars.On 6 August 2017, the club won their fourth Arab title and third Arab club championship by beating the Jordanian side Al Faisaly (3\u20132) after extra time. After winning its 28 league title on 8 April, Esp\u00e9rance won its third CAF Champions League against Al Ahly despite a defeat (3\u20131) on the home soil of the eight-time African champions in the first leg. In the second match, the Tunisians won with a score of 3\u20130, in front of a crowd of 60,000 people, with goals from Saad Bguir and Anice Badri. With the help of the young coach Mo\u00efne Cha\u00e2bani the club clinched the third Champions League in its history, a few months before its centenary on 15 January 2019. The club ends the 2018\u20132019 season by being crowned African champion for the fourth time after winning the CAF Champions League against Wydad  (1\u20131 away and 1\u20130 at home).\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Official honors ===\n\nS shared record\n\n\n== Current team ==\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

    "AIM-7 Sparrow": "The AIM-7 Sparrow (Air Intercept Missile) is an American, medium-range semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile operated by the United States Air Force, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corps, as well as other various air forces and navies. Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced AIM-120 AMRAAM.\nThe early Sparrow was intended primarily for use against larger targets, especially bombers and had numerous operational limitations in other uses. Against smaller targets, the need to receive a strong reflected radar signal made achieving lock-on at the missile's effective range difficult. As the launching aircraft's own radar needed to be pointed at the target throughout the engagement, this meant that in fighter-vs-fighter combat, the enemy fighter would often approach within the range of shorter-range infrared homing missiles while the launching aircraft had to continue flying towards its target. Additionally, early models were only effective against targets at roughly the same or higher altitudes, below which reflections from the ground became a problem.\nA number of upgraded Sparrow designs were developed to address these issues. In the early 1970s, the RAF developed a version with an inverse monopulse seeker and improved motor known as Skyflash, while the Italian Air Force introduced the similar Aspide. Both had the ability to be fired at targets below the launching fighter (\"look-down, shoot down\"), were more resistant to countermeasures, and were much more accurate in the terminal phase. This basic concept was then made part of the US Sparrows in the M model (for monopulse) and some of these were later updated as the P model, the last to be produced in the US. Aspides sold to China resulted in the locally produced PL10. The Japan Self-Defense Forces also employ the Sparrow missile, though it is being phased out and replaced by the Mitsubishi AAM-4.\nThe Sparrow was also used as the basis for a surface-to-air missile, the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow, used by a number of navies for air defense. Fired at low altitude and flying directly at its target, although, the range of the missile in this role is greatly reduced due to the lower atmosphere. With the retirement of the Sparrow in the air-to-air role, a new version of the Sea Sparrow was produced to address this concern, producing the larger and more capable RIM-162 ESSM.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Sparrow I ===\n\nSparrow emerged from a late-1940s United States Navy program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. In 1947 the Navy contracted Sperry to build a beam riding version of a standard 5-inch (127 mm) HVAR, the standard unguided aerial rocket, under  Project Hotshot. The weapon was initially dubbed KAS-1, then AAM-2, and, from 1948 on, AAM-N-2. The airframe was developed by Douglas Aircraft Company. The diameter of the HVAR proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading Douglas to expand the missile's airframe to 8-inch (203 mm) diameter. The prototype weapon began unpowered flight-tests in 1947, and made its first aerial interception in 1952.After a protracted development cycle the initial AAM-N-2 Sparrow entered limited operational service in 1954 with specially modified Douglas F3D Skyknight all-weather carrier night fighters. In 1956, they were joined by the McDonnell F3H-2M Demon and Vought F7U Cutlass fighter aircraft. Compared to the modern versions, the Sparrow I was more streamlined and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.\nSparrow I was a limited and rather primitive weapon. The limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight on single-seater fighters and radar with night fighters) restricted the missile to attacks against targets flying a straight course and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. Only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.\n\n\n=== Sparrow II ===\n\nAs early as 1950 Douglas examined equipping the Sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as XAAM-N-2a Sparrow II, the original retroactively becoming Sparrow I. In 1952 it was given the new code AAM-N-3. The active radar made the Sparrow II a \"fire and forget\" weapon, allowing several to be fired at separate targets at the same time.\nBy 1955 Douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the F5D Skylancer interceptor. It was later selected, with some controversy, to be the primary weapon for the Canadian Avro Arrow supersonic interceptor, along with the new Astra fire-control system. For Canadian use and as a second source for US missiles, Canadair was selected to build the missiles in Quebec.\nThe small size of the missile forebody and the K-band AN/APQ-64-radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing. After considerable development and test firings in the U.S. and Canada, Douglas abandoned development in 1956. Canadair continued development until the Arrow was cancelled in 1959.\n\n\n=== Sparrow X ===\nA subvariant of the Sparrow I armed with the same nuclear warhead as the MB-1 Genie was proposed in 1958 but was cancelled shortly thereafter.\n\n\n=== Sparrow III ===\n\nConcurrently with the development of the Sparrow I, in 1951, Raytheon began work on the semi-active radar homing version of Sparrow family of missiles, the AAM-N-6 Sparrow III. The first of these weapons entered United States Navy service in 1958.\nThe AAM-N-6a was similar to the -6, but used a new Thiokol liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's F-110A Spectre (F-4 Phantom) fighters in 1962, known to them as the AIM-101. It entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built.\nAnother upgrade reverted to a Rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the AAM-N-6b, which started production in 1963. The new motor significantly increased the maximum range to 35 kilometres (22 mi) for head-on attacks.\nDuring this year the Air Force and Navy agreed on standardized naming conventions for their missiles. The Sparrows became the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the AIM-7A and AIM-7B, despite both being out of service. The -6, -6a, and -6b became the AIM-7C, AIM-7D, and AIM-7E respectively.\n25,000 AIM-7Es were produced and saw extensive use during the Vietnam War, where its performance was considered disappointing. The mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited BVR (beyond visual range) engagements. The Pk (kill probability) of the AIM-7E was less than 10%; US fighter pilots shot down 59 aircraft out of the 612 Sparrows fired. Of the 612 AIM-7D/E/E-2 missiles fired, 97 (or 15.8%) hit their targets, resulting in 56 (or 9.2%) kills. Two kills were obtained beyond visual range.In 1969 an improved version, the E-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fuzing. Considered a \"dogfight Sparrow\", the AIM-7E-2 was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, and in the head-on aspect, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. Even so, its kill rate was only 13% in combat, leading to a practice of ripple-firing all four at once in hopes of increasing kill probability. Its worst tendency was that of detonating prematurely, approximately a thousand feet in front of the launching aircraft, but it also had many motor failures, erratic flights, and fuzing problems. An E-3 version included additional changes to the fuzing, and an E-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the F-14 Tomcat.\n\n\n=== Vietnam War (1965\u20131973) records ===\nImproved versions of the AIM-7 were developed in the 1970s in an attempt to address the weapon's limitations. The AIM-7F, which entered service in 1976, had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, solid-state electronics for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. Even this version had room for improvement, leading British Aerospace and the Italian firm Alenia to develop advanced versions of Sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the BAe Skyflash and Alenia Aspide, respectively.\nThe most common version of the Sparrow today, the AIM-7M, entered service in 1982 and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar proximity fuse, digital controls, improved ECM resistance, and better low-altitude performance. It was used to good advantage in the 1991 Gulf War, where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills. Of 44 missiles fired, 30 (68.2%) hit their intended targets resulting in 24/26 (54.5%/59.1%) kills. 19 kills were obtained beyond visual range.The AIM-7P is similar in most ways to the M versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or removed from the inventory.\nThe final version of the missile was to have been the AIM-7R, which added an infrared homing seeker to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997.\nSparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar AIM-120 AMRAAM, but is likely to remain in service for several years.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Foreign versions ==\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nAs part of the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow program, Canadair (now Bombardier) partnered with Douglas Aircraft Company in the development of the Sparrow II (AAM-N-3/AIM-7B).  After Douglas dropped out of this program, Canadair continued on with it until the termination of the Arrow project.\nThe AAM-N-3 Sparrow II was unique in that it had a fully active radar guidance system. This combined both a radar transmitter and receiver in the missile, making it unnecessary for the pilot to keep the aircraft aimed at the target after firing the missile, unlike Semi-active radar homing (SARH) missiles which require continuous radar-assisted guidance throughout flight. This allowed the aircraft that fired the AAM-N-3 to turn away, prosecute other targets, and/or escape from potential retaliatory missiles fired by the enemy aircraft during the time it takes for the Sparrow to reach its target. Despite the significant advantages of this design over SARH guidance, all subsequent models of the Sparrow use semi-active radar homing.\nTo accommodate the active radar guidance system, the AAM-N-3 Sparrow II had a much greater volume than its predecessor. Its size would subsequently set the precedent for all future Sparrow variants.In 1959, Canadair had completed five missiles based on airframes from Douglas, and built two models from scratch, when the program was cancelled with the cancellation of the Arrow.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\n\nThe Italian company Finmeccanica (now Leonardo S.p.A.), Alenia Difesa licensed the AIM-7E Sparrow technology from the US, and produced its own version.\nLater in the 1980s, Alenia started to produce an improved version of the AIM-7 called the Aspide, compared to the AIM-7E, it received a newer and improved monopulse guiding system that allowed for a better hit ratio and easier targeting of enemies at low altitude confused in the ground clutter.\nIt also received a new and more powerful engine and new control surfaces, these control surfaces were all independent one of the others, this gave the missile a much better maneuverability compared to the AIM-7E and the English Skyflash that still used dependent control surfaces.\n\n\n=== People's Republic of China ===\n\nThe LY-60/FD-60/PL-10 is a family of PRC missiles developed by the Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, largely based on the Italian Aspide missile \u2013 a version of the Sparrow. There are four versions of the basic design, three of which are surface-to-air and one air-to-air.\n\n\n=== Soviet Union ===\nThe Soviet Union acquired an AIM-7 in 1968 and a Vympel team started copying it as the K-25. The missile did not enter production as the R-23 was thought to have better versatility, range, signal processing logic, and immunity from interference. K-25 work ended in 1971, but analysis of the Sparrow was later used to inform the design of the Vympel R-27, particularly the servomechanisms and movable wings.\n\n\n=== UK ===\n\nBritish Aerospace (BAe) licensed the AIM-7E2 technology in the 1970s, producing the Skyflash missile. Skyflash used a Marconi XJ521 monopulse seeker together with improvements to the electronics. It was powered by the Aerojet Mk52 mod 2 rocket engine (later by the Rocketdyne Mk38 mod 4). Skyflash entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) on their Phantom FG.1/FGR.2 in 1978, and later on the Tornado F3. Skyflash was also exported to Sweden for use on their Viggen fighters.\nAn upgraded version with active radar seeker, called Active Sky Flash was proposed by BAe and Thomson-CSF, but did not receive funding because the RAF opted for other missiles.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe Sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, warhead, control, and rocket motor (currently the Hercules MK-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). It has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. Although the external dimensions of the Sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. The warhead is of the continuous-rod type.\nAs with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. The receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.\n\n\n== Principle of guidance ==\nThe launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. In radars of the 1950s these were single target tracking devices using a nutating horn as part of the antenna. This caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. Signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. The missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. The missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing waveguides. The comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting chaff.\n\n\n== Operators ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAIM-9 Sidewinder\nAIM-54 Phoenix\nBrazo\nList of missiles\nSparoair\nSuper 530\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n\n== External links ==\nAero Arrow Recovery Canada\nGlobalSecurity.org\nDesignation-Systems.Net",
    "1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game": "The 1990 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 61st playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 10, 1990, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, the home of the Chicago Cubs of the National League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 2\u20130. The game is remembered for a rain delay in the 7th inning that resulted in CBS airing Rescue 911 during the delay. This is also the first game \u2013 and so far the only one \u2013 to feature two players bearing the same name: Gregg Olson was a pitcher, representing the AL squad and Baltimore Orioles, while catcher Greg Olson represented the NL squad and Atlanta Braves. Outfielder Jose Canseco of the Oakland Athletics and First Baseman Will Clark of the San Francisco Giants were the leaders of their leagues in the fan votes. They both batted third in the line up for their squads. \nThe pregame ceremonies celebrated the 85th anniversary of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station which, as with previous All-Star Games held in Chicago, provided the colors presentation.  After Wayne Messmer sang O Canada, recording artist (and native Chicagoan) Richard Marx sang The Star-Spangled Banner.  The last All-Star Game previously held at Wrigley Field was represented by Ernie Banks who threw out the ceremonial first pitch.\nThe National League registered just two hits in the contest, the fewest by any team in the history of the All-Star Game.\n\n\n== Rosters ==\nPlayers in italics have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n\n== Game ==\n\n\n=== Umpires ===\n\n\n=== Starting lineups ===\n\n\n=== Game summary ===\nAll the scoring was done by the American League in a single inning.

He is known as a rationalist who offered natural explanations for the biblical miracles of Jesus.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPaulus was a professor of theology and oriental languages at the University of Jena (1789\u20131803), then professor at the University of W\u00fcrzburg (1803\u20131807). He spent time in Bamberg, N\u00fcrnberg and Ansbach before becoming professor of exegesis and church history at the University of Heidelberg (1811\u201344), where he was instrumental in hiring Hegel in 1816. His theological rationalism greatly influenced Hegel's own theology.\nAs a Lutheran in the Age of Enlightenment, he firmly believed in the autonomy of the individual and freedom of the individual (through reason) from the dogma of the church.\nCharges of anti-semitism have been levelled at Paulus for his advocacy of assimilation of Jewish people into German culture. In his published pamphlet \"The Jewish National Separation: Its Origin, Consequences, and the Means of its Correction.\" he argued that \"Jews were a nation apart, and would remain so as long as they were committed to their religion, whose basic intent and purpose were to preserve them in that condition. In a country that was not their own, therefore, Jews could not claim more than the bare protection of their lives and possessions. They might certainly not claim political equality.\"\nPaulus is the first scholar to propose \"the swoon theory\" which speculates that Jesus did not actually die on the cross, but somehow survived his execution and proclaimed that He had risen from the dead.

    "Marcus Harvey": "Marcus Harvey (born 1963 in Leeds) is an English artist and painter, one of the Young British Artists (YBAs).\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nHarvey has shown work internationally in many exhibitions including \"The F\u00fchrer's Cakes\" at Galleria Marabini in Bologna, \"Snaps\" and \"White Riot\" at White Cube in London, \"Sex and the British\" at Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac in Salzburg, \"Crucible\" a sculpture exhibition held inside Gloucester Cathedral, and \"London Calling: Young British Artists Criss-Crossed\" at Galleri Kaare Berntsen in Oslo. He was included in the original \"Young British Artists\" exhibition series at Saatchi Gallery in 1995 and was in other important YBA shows like \"In the darkest hour there may be light\" at Serpentine Galleries.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nMarcus has work in public collections including The Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; The British Council Collection, London; the Goss-Michael Foundation of Contemporary British Art, TX; and prominent lending private collections including the \"Murder Me\" collection of artist Damien Hirst, UK; the Saatchi Collection, UK; and the Logan Collection, San Francisco.\n\n\n== Life and art ==\nMarcus Harvey grew up in Moortown, a suburb of Leeds. He attended Allerton Grange High School, graduated from Goldsmiths College in 1986, and is also an alumnus of the Leeds College of Art. At that time he became a close friend of Damien Hirst. Harvey did not take part in the Freeze show as he had graduated from Goldsmiths earlier, but Hirst included him when he curated Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away (1994). Harvey's work attracted the attention of Charles Saatchi. He currently lives and works in London.\nBeyond the studio, Marcus Harvey joined with fellow painter Peter Ashton Jones to form Turps Banana Magazine in 2005. Turps focuses on new writing about both art historical and contemporary painting, written entirely by contemporary practicing painters. The magazine is published twice a year with full colour reproductions and a commitment to no advertising. The cover design is in yellow, with the word \"TURPS\" and the iconic banana of Andy Warhol. In 2012, Turps Art School was founded to allow emerging and mid career painters to take a year painting intensive with other practicing painters, it has been heralded as an alternative model for arts education by Jonathan Jones for The Guardian in 2014 as \"The renegade art school proving that painting is not dead.\"Harvey is known for his tabloid-provoking 9 by 11 feet (2.7 by 3.4 m) portrayal of Moors murderer Myra Hindley, created from handprints taken from a plaster cast of a child\u2019s hand, and shown in the Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art in 1997. The painting had to be temporarily removed from display for repair after it was attacked in two separate incidents on the opening day, in which ink and eggs were thrown at it. The Times newspaper's art critic, Richard Cork, wrote that:\n\nFar from cynically exploiting her notoriety, Harvey's grave and monumental canvas succeeds in conveying the enormity of the crime she committed. Seen from afar, through several doorways, Hindley's face looms at us like an apparition. By the time we get close enough to realise that it is spattered with children's handprints, the sense of menace becomes overwhelming.\nHarvey's current work combines painting, photography, and sculpture while exploring British iconography in pop culture, the landscape, and cultural history. These recent works include thick gestural figurative paintings made on top of and obscuring photographic prints of landscapes and figures. His new ceramics and bronzes are an amalgam of art historical and historical references making \"collaged portraits\" from Nelson to Margaret Thatcher and from Napoleon to Tony Blair. The work has been received as a more mature kind of politics in work that continues to explore the possibilities of gesture in medium specificity with his \"urgent physicality.\"\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMarcus Harvey on the Saatchi Gallery web site\nMarcus Harvey on Vigo Gallery website\nMarcus Harvey at Artfacts.Net\nMarcus Harvey on Artcyclopedia",

    "Abbey of St. Sergius, Angers": "The Abbey of St. Sergius, more fully the Abbey of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, in Angers (French: Abbaye Saint-Serge d'Angers or Abbaye des Saints Serge et Bacchus d'Angers) was a Benedictine monastery in France.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was founded probably in the early 7th century, and is mentioned in a diploma dated 705 of Childebert IV (\"monasterio quod est in honore pecularis patroni nostri sancti Sergii et domini Medardi episcopi\"). Rainon, bishop of Angers, set up a college of canons there in around 900, when the monastery came under the control of the diocese.\nIt became a monastery again when Bishop Renaud II introduced a Benedictine community in around 1000. It was then rebuilt, under the patronage of the counts of Anjou, and reconsecrated in 1059 with a dedication to Saints Sergius and Bacchus.\nThe abbey's location outside the city walls exposed it to pillage during the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of Religion. It was placed under commendatory abbots in 1590.\nIn 1629 the abbey joined the reformist movement of the Congregation of St Maur.It was dissolved in 1790 in the French Revolution. The former abbey church became a parish church, while the conventual buildings, after use as a seminary and a college, are now in use as the Lyc\u00e9e Joachim-du-Bellay.Of the surviving buildings, the church was listed as a monument historique in 1840. The chapter room and the chapel were classed in 1907, the refectory in 1908 and the central building and part of the cloister in 1967.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nR. P. Dom J.-M.

    "Iamgold": "Iamgold Corporation (formerly Iamgold International African Mining Gold Corporation) is a Canadian company that owns and operates gold mines in Burkina Faso, Suriname and Canada. Headquartered in Toronto, the company was incorporated in 1990, and went public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1996, with additional shares being listed on the New York Stock Exchange beginning in 2005.  The company formerly owned or had stakes in the Sadiola and Yatela gold mines in Mali, the Mupane gold mine in Botswana, the Niobec niobium mine in Quebec, as well as a royalty in the Diavik Diamond Mine.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nEntering 2020, Iamgold controlled three productive mines that had combined to produced 762,000 ounces in 2019. In addition, the company owned controlling interest in two developing mines with stakes exploration activities in numerous locations in west Africa, Canada, Nicaragua, Brazil.\nThe company's largest operating mine is located in Burkina Faso. Iamgold subsidiary company Essakane S.A. operates the Essakane gold mine with the Government of Burkina Faso owning a 10% stake. It is an open pit mine, with heap leach processing, along the Gorouol River near the town of Falagountou and the border with Niger. It was acquired by Iamgold in 2009 from Orezone Resources who had conducted exploration and development activities. The mine began commercial production in July 2010. With 3.8 million ounces in proved and probable reserves as of 2020, the mine has produced approximately 350,000-450,000 ounces of gold per year.In Suriname, Iamgold subsidiary company Rosebel Gold Mines N.V. operates the Rosebel gold mine with the Government of Suriname owning a 5% stake. It is an open pit mine located near the town of Brownsweg. Golden Star Resources and Cambior had conducted the exploration and development work to bring the mine into commercial production in 2004. Iamgold acquired Cambior in 2006 while Golden Star sold its stake to Euro Ressources S.A. which Iamgold acquired in 2008. With 2.9 million ounces in proved and probable reserves as of 2020 (with additional reserves in the neighboring Saramacca expansion property and potential for zinc extraction), the mine has produced approximately 300,000 ounces of gold per year.In the Abitibi Municipality of Quebec, Iamgold acquired the Doyon Division mining property with its 2006 acquisition of Cambior. As its older Doyon mine ceased production in 2009, the facilities were re-purposed to support the developing and operation of the new Westwood gold mine which began commercial production in 2014. The ore from the open pit mine is processing at the refurbished Doyon mill using the carbon in pulp method. Zinc deposits. With 1.2 million ounces in proved and probable reserves as of 2020, the mine has produced around 100,000 ounces of gold per year.Iamgold's two developing mines are the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold project in the Sudbury District of Ontario, and the Boto Gold project in the K\u00e9dougou Region of Senegal. The company involvement in the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold project began in 2012 when it acquired Trelawney Mining and Exploration which held the mineral rights. In 2017, with a preliminary economic assessment estimating a 21-year mine life producing an average of 302,000 ounces of gold annually at an all-in sustaining cost of $686/oz, Iamgold sold a 30% stake in C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold to Sumitomo Metal Mining. A feasibility study completed the next year estimated the open pit mine would require an initial capital cost of $1.15 billion and adjusted the estimated production numbers to 367,000 ounces of gold annually over 16 year life span. Meanwhile, feasibility studies for the Senegalese Boto Gold project estimated a potential for approximately 160,000 ounces of gold annually over 11-year mine life.\n\n\n== Corporate history ==\nThe Iamgold International African Mining Gold Corporation (re-named Iamgold Corporation in 1997) was founded on March 27, 1990, by businessmen Mark Nathanson and William Pugliese to pursue a mining concession being offered in Mali. Headquartered in Markham, Ontario, the company partnered with South African gold mining company Anglo American's AngloGold Ashanti to develop the Sadiola Gold Mine. To fund this, Iamgold raised $60 million in an initial public offering becoming a publicly-listed company on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1996, with an additional $13 million worth of shares being issued the following year. With the success of developing the Sadiola Gold Mine, Iamgold and AngloGold Ashanti developed a second mine, the Yatela Mine, which began production in 2001. With profits now being realized, Iamgold was listed on the TSE 300 index and began issuing dividends to shareholders, uniquely the dividends were aid in bullion instead of cash. Additional shares were issued in 2002 and they company became listed on the American Stock Exchange. The company incurred a court-ordered $1.7 million fine, payable to Kinbauri Gold for withdrawing from a merger agreement. Also in late-2002, in a $218 million in all-stock deal, Iamgold acquired royalty company Repadre Capital Corp. which had stakes in several gold and diamond mines in Canada and Africa, most significant of which was a 19% interest in Gold Fields's Tarkwa and Damang mines in Ghana. With Repadre's Joseph Conway taking over as CEO of the combined company, the merger boosted Iamgold's attributable gold production to 421,000 ounces from 290,000 ounces the year before.After moving its headquarters from Markham to Toronto, the directors and CEOs of Iamgold and Wheaton River Minerals Ltd. agreed to a merger deal that would create a new company to be called Axiom Gold, valued at about $2.9 billion in 2004. However Iamgold stakeholders fought the proposal. BMO Nesbitt Burns and CIBC World Markets organized competing offers, Golden Star Resources Ltd. to acquire Iamgold for $1.2-billion and Coeur d'Alene Mines Corp. to acquire Wheaton River for $2.56 billion, whose rejection by the Iamgold and Wheaton River board of directors was fought in court. While the shareholder votes were delayed due to the court cases, Wheaton River shareholders voted in favour of the merger but Iamgold shareholders rejected it. The company subsequently made a failed bid to acquire assets of Gold Fields. With the failed merger and acquisition behind them, in the next two years the company acquired Australian company Gallery Gold and its Mupane gold mine in Botswana in an $235 million all-stock deal, and Cambior with its Rosebel mine in Suriname, a Niobium mine in Quebec and several older Quebec gold mines in a $1.2 billion deal. With 100% interest in the Mupane, Doyon & Mouska, Sleeping Giant and Niobec mines, as well as a 95% interest in the Rosebel mine, the mergers transitioned the company from an investor into an operator and increased their attributable gold production from 642,000 ounces in 2006 to 965,000 ounces in 2007, and peaking at 997,000 ounces in 2008. The company fared well during the 2008 recession with its stock falling from $8 per share at the beginning of the year to bottoming out at $4 in October and peaking again at $20 by November 2009. They sold off numerous non-core assets, such as royalties acquired from Repadre, the La Arena copper project in Peru acquired from Cambior, and closed the Sleeping Giant (selling the mill and remaining property), and Doyon mines. In the same timeframe, they initiated plans to develop the Westwood mine using the Doyon property and acquired Orezone Resources Inc. and its Essakane Project in Burkina Faso.While 2008 proved to be their best year in terms of gold production, the company's stock price peaked in 2011 at $21.40. After CEO Joseph Conway stepped down in January 2010, replaced by interim CEO Peter Jones until Enbridge executive Stephen Letwin was hired, the Essakane mine had commenced production in July 2010. In June 2011, Iamgold sold its 19% stake in the Tarkwa and Damang gold mines in Ghana to Gold Fields Limited for $667 million and its Mupane gold mine in Botswana to Galane Gold Ltd. for $34 million. In 2012, in a $608-million purchase, Iamgold  acquired Trelawney Mining and Exploration and its C\u00f4t\u00e9 Lake gold deposit, near Sudbury, Ontario which they believed could be developed into a significant mine; although a 30% stake had to be sold to Sumitomo Metal Mining to help fund its development. While the sales also helped finance the expansion of Essakane and the development of the Westwood mine, production would peak again at 882,000 ounces in 2017 and 2018, before falling to 762,000 ounces in 2019 as the Yatela mine became exhausted and Sadiola mine was sold in December 2019. Looking towards future projects, Iamgold purchased Merrex Gold and its Siribaya-Diakha exploration property in Mali.\n\n\n=== Past mines (divested and closed) ===\nSince opening the Sadiola Gold Mine in 1996, Iamgold has held stakes or outright owned numerous mines that later sold or ceased operation.\n\nThe Sadiola Gold Mine in Mali was operated by joint-venture partner AngloGold Ashanti, each with a 41% working interest. It was sold to Allied Gold in 2019.\nThe Yatela Mine gold mine in Mali was operated by joint-venture partner AngloGold Ashanti, each with a 40% working interest. Mining activities had ceased in 2013, though processing continued into 2016.\nThe Tarkwa mine and Damang mine in Ghana were operated by Gold Fields. Iamgold secured a 19% stake in the mines with the acquisition of Repadre Capital in 2002 but sold their interests to Gold Fields in 2011.\nThe Mupane gold mine in Botswana, opened in 2004, was secured with the acquisition of Gallery Gold in 2005. Its 100% interest in the mine was sold in 2011 to Galane Gold, though Iamgold retained 48% interest in Galane until 2016 when the company totally divested.\nThe Doyon and Mouska gold mines in Abitibi, Quebec, were secured with the acquisition of Cambior in 2006. Though the Doyon mine, which had opened in 1980, closed in 2008, its mill was refurbished and upgraded for processing the Westwood mine's ore with treated material being disposed of in the old Doyon open pit. The Mouska mine continued until 2014 before being decommissioned.\nThe Sleeping Giant gold mine (known in French as Mine G\u00e9ant Dormant) in Quebec was also acquired in 2006 with Cambior but sold to Cadiscor Resources in 2008.\nLa Arena, a Peruvian copper / gold project acquired with Cambior was sold to Rio Alto Mining in 2008.\nThe Niobec underground mine near Chicoutimi, Quebec. This mine is North America's only source of pyrochlore, the primary niobium ore, and one of only three major producers of niobium.

    "Thomas Proctor (general)": "Thomas Proctor or Thomas Procter (1739 \u2013 16 March 1806) commanded the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. He was born in County Longford, Ireland, emigrated to British America, married in 1767 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and joined the carpenter's guild in 1772. Receiving a commission as an artillery captain in October 1775, he proceeded to raise a company of Pennsylvania state artillery. After a second company was recruited, Proctor was promoted to major and both companies joined George Washington's army. Proctor led his gunners at Princeton in January 1777. The state authorities elevated Proctor to the rank of colonel and charged him to recruit an eight-company Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment a month later.\nIn June 1777 Proctor's Continental Artillery Regiment officially became part of the Continental Army. He played an important role in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown in 1777 and at Monmouth in 1778. He went on the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois Nation in 1779. His regiment was renamed the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment in August 1779. He took guns into action at Bull's Ferry in 1780. The hot-tempered Proctor often quarreled with the Pennsylvania civil authorities and this led him to resign from the army in April 1781.\nProctor served as county sheriff of Philadelphia in 1783\u20131785 and City Lieutenant of Philadelphia in 1790. Secretary of War Henry Knox named him to go on a peace mission in 1791 to the Native American tribes near Lake Erie. Proctor was appointed a brigadier general of militia in 1793 and the following year was sent to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion. In 1798 he became a major general of militia. He died at Philadelphia in March 1806, having outlived his second wife by two years.\n\n\n== Early career ==\nProctor was born in County Longford, Ireland in 1739. With his parents Francis and Betsey Proctor, he moved first to Nova Scotia and then to the American colonies. At some point in the 1750s he took up the carpenter's trade. The year 1759 found him at Fort Pitt where he met the Seneca chief Captain Joseph Hays. He married Mary Fox on December 31, 1766 in Philadelphia. They would have four children, Anna (1788-1858), Jacob (1774-1856), Mary (1789-1842) and Thomas (1784\u20131861). Proctor had a younger brother Francis Jr. who was born in the 1750s and died in 1814. In 1772, he joined the Carpenter's Guild in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and remained a member until his death.\n\n\n== American Revolution ==\n\n\n=== 1775\u20131777 ===\n\nAfter the outbreak of the American Revolution, the state of Pennsylvania authorized an artillery company on October 16, 1775. Proctor asked the state Council of Safety to appoint him captain on October 27 and his request was immediately granted. While other state troops were sent to the Flying Camp (reserve), the artillery company was retained near Philadelphia to defend Fort Island. At first, Proctor's company mustered only 25 men but it increased to 100 by May 1776.A muster roll from July 31, 1776 showed Proctor's company numbering 114 soldiers. The staff included one captain-lieutenant, one first lieutenant, one second lieutenant, one lieutenant fireworker, one quartermaster sergeant, and one clerk. The company also counted three sergeants, three corporals, eight bombardiers, 24 gunners, 69 matrosses, six musicians, five drummers, and one fifer. The gunners served on the USS Hornet (10) during an engagement with the British HMS Roebuck (44). Pleased with the gunners' performance, the state added a second artillery company to create the Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion on 14 August 1776. At the time, John Martin Strobaugh was appointed captain of the 1st Company, Thomas Forrest became captain of the 2nd Company, and Proctor was promoted to major. Proctor vigorously recruited enough gunners and matrosses to fill both companies. The Pennsylvania State Artillery Battalion transferred to George Washington's main army on 23 September. In October the state re-enrolled the soldiers for the duration of the war.On December 22, 1776, Forrest's 2nd Company mustered with Washington's army in the strength of two officers and 50 men with two brass 6-pounders. In the Battle of Trenton four days later the battery is said to have two 5\u00bd-inch howitzers in addition to the pair of 6-pounders. Together with two guns under Alexander Hamilton and three guns under Sebastian Baumann, Forrest's guns dominated King Street with their fire and silenced the two Hessian cannons opposing them. In the Battle of the Assunpink Creek on January 2, 1777, Forrest had six cannons supporting a 1,000-man delaying force under Edward Hand. The American artillery commander Henry Knox stated that he had \"30 to 40\" guns at Assunpink Creek. These included 18\u201319 guns guarding the bridge, 12 guns at the upper fords and several more at the lower fords. The next day, Proctor led his artillerists at the Battle of Princeton. After the engagement, he added a captured British brass 6-pounder cannon to his battery. Since he did not have enough horses to haul an additional piece, he left behind an old iron 3-pounder cannon.\n\nWhen Knox went on leave on January 17, 1777, he appointed Proctor temporary commander of the army's artillery. Proctor capably performed this duty, though some Continental officers were annoyed that a man with a state commission was elevated above them. On February 6, 1777 the battalion was expanded into the Pennsylvania State Artillery Regiment, with orders to recruit eight companies from the eastern part of the state. The new regiment was detached from the main army. Proctor accepted promotion to colonel commanding the regiment on February 20. A company from the regiment was roughly handled at the Battle of Bound Brook on April 13, losing two cannons, two officers and about 20 men captured. On June 10, 1777 the state regiment became Proctor's Continental Artillery Regiment and first transferred to the Middle Department before being attached to the main army a few weeks later on July 14. Washington ordered Proctor's regiment to Trenton, New Jersey to join Francis Nash's brigade where it arrived about July 24. After getting news of the British landing in Chesapeake Bay, Nash's troops and Proctor's gunners were instructed to move to Chester, Pennsylvania on August 22.During the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Proctor's Pennsylvania Artillery manned a 4-gun lunette on a knoll that overlooked Chadds Ford. Two of the guns were French-made 4-pounders, another was a 3-pounder Hessian prize that was rebored as a 6-pounder and the last was an 8-inch howitzer cast in Philadelphia. At 8:00\u20139:00 am an artillery duel began between the American guns and the British artillery on the west side of Brandywine Creek. Sometime afterward, Washington conferred with Proctor on how things were going. At 5:30 pm the British mounted a major assault across the creek. Firing canister shot, Proctor's guns caused considerable casualties before the British successfully stormed the lunette. The Americans claimed to have saved two of the cannons.During the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777, the American first wave encountered 100\u2013120 men of the British 40th Regiment of Foot shut up in the Benjamin Chew House and flowed around the obstacle. When the reserves arrived, Knox convinced Washington that the place must be captured. Two cannons of Proctor's Artillery plus two captured British 6-pounders were already firing at the building. Staff officer Timothy Pickering suggested that the guns be brought to bear on the front of the building, so this was done. The front doors were quickly blown open and the shutters splintered but unknown to the gunners the front of the house was constructed of stone two feet thick, impervious to light cannons. For two hours, the guns blasted the masonry with round shot or fired canister at the second story, but all American infantry attacks were repulsed with heavy losses.\n\n\n=== 1778\u20131783 ===\n\nOn February 27, 1778, Washington wrote from Valley Forge that Proctor's Regiment suffered \"considerable\" casualties in the 1777 campaign and serious desertion since. Because of the weakness of his artillery arm, Washington ordered Harrison's Artillery Regiment to join him at Valley Forge.At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Proctor led 12 guns in William Alexander, Lord Stirling's wing which was in Washington's main body. After Charles Lee's advance guard was driven back at mid-day, the advancing British encountered the American main body. There were five infantry brigades in line with two detachments covering the left and another infantry brigade screening the right. Under the direction of Knox, the 12 guns were massed in a large battery on the forward slope of Perrine's Ridge about 1:00\u20131:30 pm. The American 6-pounders and 4-pounders engaged in an inconclusive 2-hour artillery duel with a British concentration that included two 12-pounders, six 6-pounders and two 5\u00bd-inch howitzers. When four American cannons under Thomas-Antoine de Mauduit du Plessis took the British gun line in enfilade from Comb's Hill about 3:00 pm, British army commander Henry Clinton ordered a withdrawal.By August 4, 1778, Proctor's Regiment counted only 220 men, so a few weeks later he applied to the Pennsylvania Council to enlist men from other states and it was granted. The regiment was finally accepted into the Continental Army on September 3. Until this time, the unit belonged to Pennsylvania even though it served with the Continental Army. There were frequent clashes between President Joseph Reed and Proctor over the matter of supplies. At this time Proctor demanded new uniforms which were supposed to be black for the artillery, but he insisted on letting his officers wear blue coats. Reed complained to Washington and it was determined that Proctor officers must conform to the new uniform policy in the following year. Reed remarked that Proctor only recognized the authority of Pennsylvania when he needed a favor. On May 18, 1779 Congress finally commissioned Proctor as colonel in the Continental Army.\n\nProctor went on the Sullivan Expedition against the Iroquois Nation. He accompanied John Sullivan's 2,500-man main column with four 3-pounders, two 6-pounders and two howitzers. A force of Iroquois and Butler's Rangers tried to ambush the Americans in the Battle of Newtown on August 29, 1779. When the enemy presence was discovered, Sullivan launched an enveloping attack. Proctor's guns opened fire and some of the howitzer shells exploded in the rear of the enemy position. Thinking that the Americans were attacking from behind, many of the Iroquois immediately ran away. The remaining warriors and the Rangers eventually retreated before the numerically superior Americans, but casualties were few on both sides. The expedition ruined the Iroquois Nation by wrecking their towns and burning their crops, but it did not stop the warriors from attacking American settlements. Proctor's Regiment was renamed the 4th Continental Artillery Regiment on August 10, 1779.Congress recommissioned Proctor as colonel on April 21, 1780. Under the command of Anthony Wayne he was present at the Battle of Bull's Ferry on July 20. The cattle raid was successful but the Americans were unable to storm a blockhouse manned by Loyalists despite a bombardment by four cannons. Proctor's role is known because British Major John Andr\u00e9 penned a satirical poem about the battle called the Cow Chace that mentioned the American artilleryman. Infuriated over the Pennsylvania Council's promotion of officers without his approval, Proctor tendered his resignation on April 9, 1781. Reed wrote to Washington that he was pleased to be rid of such a difficult officer.Washington wrote a letter to Proctor accepting his resignation as follows. \"I am sorry to find that the situation of your domestic affairs renders it necessary for you to quit the service. It always gives me pain to part with an officer, but particularly so with one whose experience and attention have made him useful in his profession. I cannot in justice to you permit you to leave the army without expressing my approbation of your conduct upon every occasion since you joined me in 1776, and wish you success in the line of life which you have now embraced.\" From December 25, 1782 to October 22, 1783 Proctor held a commission from Congress as major.\n\n\n== Later career ==\n\nProctor served as sheriff of Philadelphia County from October 20, 1783 to October 14, 1785. His wife Mary died on July 15, 1789. He was appointed as City Lieutenant of Philadelphia on September 10, 1790 to fill a vacancy. On March 10, 1791, Knox, now Secretary of War appointed him to go on a peace mission to the Wabash and Miami tribes near Lake Erie. Proctor left two days later and spent two months among the Native Americans. Governor Thomas Mifflin appointed Proctor a major of artillery on May 17, 1792 and brigadier general of militia on April 12, 1793. Proctor was given command of a brigade of 1,849 men to put down the Whiskey Rebellion on August 7, 1794.Proctor married Sarah Ann Hussey on March 3, 1796 and they had one child, Mary (d. 1842). He was named major general of militia on June 7, 1796. He experienced financial difficulties, especially in getting compensation for expenses from the state of Pennsylvania. For example, he was not reimbursed for a horse that was killed at Brandywine until 1793.

The General overseer (most senior pastor) is Enoch Adeboye, ordained in 1981. The church in Lagos has an average church attendance of 100,000.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe RCCG was founded in 1952 by Rev. Josiah Olufemi Akindayomi (1909\u20131980) following his involvement in other churches. Rev. Akindayomi chose Enoch Adejare Adeboye as the next General overseer. Enoch Adeboye was a lecturer in mathematics at the University of Lagos, Nigeria, as at the time he joined the church in 1973. Adeboye initially became one of the interpreters translating Akindayomi's sermons from Yoruba to English. He was ordained a pastor of the church in 1975, and his appointment as the leader (General overseer) of the church was formalized by the posthumous reading of Akindayomi's sealed pronouncement. In 1990, the Redeemed Christian Church of God Bible School was founded.In 1981, Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye became the General Overseer of the Church. In 1983, the land for the Redemption Camp in Mowe was purchased. In 1988, a students\u2019 body known as the Redeemed Christian Fellowship (RCF) was established. It is the youth wing of the church concentrated within tertiary institutions of learning in the country. In 1990, Christ the Redeemer\u2019s Friends Universal (CRFU), was established to garner financial and human resources from the very wealthy in the society. In 2005, Redeemer's University was established.\nAndrew Rice, writing in The New York Times, calls the RCCG \"one of [Africa's] most vigorously expansionary religious movements, a homegrown Pentecostal denomination that is crusading to become a global faith\". The church's leaders preach that in the future \"In every household, there will be at least one member of Redeemed Christian Church of God in the whole world.\"In 2008, it had 14,000 churches and 5 million members in Nigeria, in 80 countries.The international church is structured in different areas throughout the world. The local churches are now grouped into regions, with 25 Regions in Nigeria. It is also organised throughout most of the world. Notable special spiritual programs are the Holy Ghost Service which holds on the first Friday of every month in Nigeria. Then, the annual Holy Ghost Convention(August) and the Holy Ghost Congress (December) in Nigeria and beyond with diverse schedules.\nIn 2020, the Lagos Church had 50,000 people.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\nThe official RCCG website outlines its beliefs in the Bible and the Holy Trinity, that the Devil exists, that God formed man in his image, in repentance, in cleansing from sins by God's grace, in sanctification, water baptism, Holy Spirit baptism, restitution and that God can heal without medicine (by His divine intervention e.g. through prayer).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of the largest evangelical churches\nList of the largest evangelical church auditoriums\nWorship service (evangelicalism)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Web Site",

    "Paccar": "PACCAR Inc is an American Fortune 500 company and counts among the largest manufacturers of medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the world. PACCAR is engaged in the design, manufacture and customer support of light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, Leyland Trucks, and DAF nameplates. PACCAR also designs and manufactures powertrains, provides financial services and information technology, and distributes truck parts related to its principal business.\n\n\n== History ==\n In 1905, William Pigott Sr. founded Seattle Car Mfg. Co. to produce railway and logging equipment at its plant in West Seattle. In February 1908, the Seattle Car Manufacturing Co. opened a modern railcar manufacturing plant in Renton. The destruction of Seattle Car's Youngstown plant by fire, coupled with the repercussions of the national financial panic of 1907, had placed the company in voluntary receivership. The new plant gave the business new momentum and company president William Pigott (1860-1929) and in particular the company vice president Oliver D. Colvin successfully shepherded the company through this difficult period. The company later merged with Twohy Brothers of Portland in 1915 to become Pacific Car and Foundry Company, a name it retained for the next 55 years. In 1924, William Pigott sold control of the company to American Car & Foundry Company.\nPaul Pigott, son of the founder, acquired a major interest in the company from American Car in 1934. Under his leadership, the company expanded its products and introduced the Carco line of power winches for use on crawler tractors in the logging industry. This product line later became the basis for PACCAR Winch, located in Oklahoma, which now includes Braden, Carco and Gearmatic.\nThe company entered the heavy-duty truck market in 1945 with its first major acquisition, Kenworth Motor Truck Company of Seattle. Pacific Car and Foundry greatly expanded its heavy-duty truck capability with the purchase of Peterbilt Motors Company in 1958. That same year, the acquisition of Dart Truck Company permitted its entry into the entirely new market of mining vehicles.\nThe company's Structural Steel division fabricated the steel for the construction of the Space Needle for the 1962 Seattle World Fair. Later, it played a major part in the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam's third powerhouse as well as the World Trade Center in New York.\nIn 1960, Kenworth expanded into Mexico, with 49 percent participation in an affiliate company, Kenworth Mexicana S.A. de C.V. In 1966 PACCAR entered the Australian truck market with the establishment of a Kenworth truck assembly plant near Melbourne.\nAlso in 1960, Carco Acceptance Corporation, currently PACCAR Financial Corp, was launched to facilitate domestic sales of trucks.\nIn 1968 the Dynacraft division was formed to provide belts, hoses, adapters, and other accessories for Kenworth and Peterbilt truck plants.\nKenworth Australia purchased 28 acres (11 ha) of land at suburban Bayswater \u2013 18 miles (30 km) east of Melbourne, in 1969, to build a factory and office complex. By the end of 1970, the 56,000 sq ft (5,200 m\u00b2) complex was completed. Initially, trucks were produced on a completely knocked down basis. During Kenworth Australia's subsequent history, it become a major force in the local, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea markets.\nBelieving \"Pacific Car and Foundry Company\" no longer accurately reflected the company's products and activities, directors and shareholders voted to adopt PACCAR Inc as its new name in 1972.\nIn 1972, PACCAR International was formed in Bellevue, Washington to consolidate the sales and service of company products abroad. PACCAR Parts was established in Renton a year later to supply aftermarket parts.\nIn 1975 PACCAR purchased International Car Company of Kenton, Ohio, North America's leading caboose manufacturer. That business shut down in 1983.PACCAR Leasing Corporation was formed in 1980 to offer full-service leasing and rental programs through PACCAR's dealer network. A year later, PACCAR became a European truck manufacturer with the acquisition of Foden Trucks in England.PACCAR's new Technical Center opened in July 1982, located approximately 65 miles north of Seattle.\nIn February 1983, the company closed its International Car Company facility that had specialized in building railway cabooses.In 1986, PACCAR acquired Trico Industries, manufacturing oil field pumps and accessories. In December 1997 Trico was sold to EVI of Houston.\nIn 1987, PACCAR acquired Washington-based Al's Auto Supply, an aftermarket retailer and wholesale distributor of auto parts and accessories. In 1988, PACCAR expanded its subsidiary PACCAR Automotive. when it purchased Grand Auto, a California based retailer of auto parts and accessories. In October 1999, PACCAR Automotive was sold to CSK Auto.\nPACCAR solidified its place in the Mexican heavy-duty truck market by purchasing the remaining portion of its Mexican operation, VILPAC, S.A. in 1995.\nThe acquisition of DAF Trucks in 1996 and Leyland Trucks in 1998 established PACCAR as one of the major truck manufacturers in the world. DAF Trucks is a Netherlands-based truck company with production facilities in Eindhoven, The Netherlands and Westerlo, Belgium. Leyland manufactures DAF trucks at its plant in Leyland, United Kingdom.\nPACCAR was awarded the National Medal of Technology at the White House in 2003 for its leadership in the development of aerodynamic, lightweight commercial vehicles which led to reduced fuel consumption and increased efficiencies.In 2010, PACCAR unveiled its PACCAR MX engine line in North America; DAF has been building engines in Europe since 1957. PACCAR invested $400 million in the PACCAR Engine factory and technology center in Columbus, Mississippi, to manufacture the proprietary engines.In 2013, PACCAR expanded its global operations with the opening of a new DAF factory in Ponta Grossa, Brazil. The company invested $320 million in the 300,000 sq ft assembly facility on 569 acres. The factory assembles the DAF XF and CF vehicles for the South American market.PACCAR announced its Silicon Valley Innovation Center in Sunnyvale, California in 2017. The center coordinates next-generation product development and identifies emerging technologies that will benefit future vehicle performance.PACCAR Winch, with brands Braden, Gearmatic and CARCO has its main office and a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and another plant in Okmulgee, Oklahoma.\n\n\n== Financials ==\nAs of 2021\n\n\n== See also ==\nEverett-Pacific Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company that became part of Paccar in 1945.\nDart (commercial vehicle) that was (time-wise with Kenworth) part of Paccar.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\nDavid Wilma, Pacific Car and Foundry Co. becomes PACCAR Inc on January 25, 1972, HistoryLink, April 11, 2001.\nPACCAR - The Pursuit of Quality, Alex Groner and Barry Provorse; Documentary Media, Seattle, Washington, 2005 \u2013 4th Edition\n\n\n== External links ==\nPACCAR Inc, PACCAR Official History Page\nBusiness data for Paccar: \nHistorical Annual Reports for Pacific Car and Foundry\nHistorical Annual Reports for PACCAR",
    "Min Shin Saw": "Min Shin Saw (Burmese: \u1019\u1004\u103a\u1038\u101b\u103e\u1004\u103a\u1005\u1031\u102c, pronounced [m\u026a\u0301\u0270\u0303 \u0283\u026a\u0300\u0270\u0303 s\u0254\u0301]; died 1167) was heir-apparent of the Pagan Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar) from c. 1117 to 1151. His father King Sithu I sent the crown prince into exile to present-day Ava (Inwa) where the prince subsequently turned into a highly cultivated region. After Sithu was assassinated in 1167, Min Shin Saw returned to Pagan to claim the throne. There, he was consecrated king but later that night, was assassinated by Narathu, his younger brother and the assassin of their father.\n\n\n== Disagreements with the king ==\nAccording to the Hmannan Yazawin chronicle, Min Shin Saw had two specific run-ins with his father. In the first incident, the king's newest young queen, a daughter of the king of Pateikkara\u2014a tributary to Pagan, stayed on the royal couch beside the king when the king's sons came to pay homage to him. Min Shin Saw refused to kneel down in front of the young queen whose name was Pabhavati. He said: \"I'm the eldest son. Shall this Kala wench abide in the couch in my presence before all the ministers and councilors?\" He left, saying \"I'm not well.\" (Kala today means Indian but may have meant foreign in those days. Pateikkara is believed to be a kingdom near today's Chin State.)\nIn the second incident, Alaungsithu awarded a royal attendant named Ananda Thuriya a robe of princely attire, worn only by princes. When the attendant showed up with the robe at the royal council, Min Shin Saw stripped the robe off Ananda Thuriya, saying \"This garment is not for a king's usher or nurse to wear. Only the king's brothers and sons are worthy to wear it.\" The old king was greatly disturbed that Min Shin Saw was acting like a king even when the king was still alive.\n\n\n== Life in exile ==\nIn 1151/1152, the king first sent Min Shin Saw to prison but at the intervention of his mother Queen Yadanabon, reduced the sentence and sent him to exile. The prince and his followers settled near today's Ava, a few miles northeast of Pagan. The prince dammed the Aung Pinle Lake, and another lake nearby. He built three canals, creating additional cultivated land. Because the land was fertile, three crops a year were raised. Min Shin Saw's enlightened policies raised funds for his treasury, and attracted a host of followers. He invited scholars and monks to write many books and teach them.Despite his success in exile, the prince remained loyal to his father. At Pagan, however, Alaungsithu had chosen Narathu as the heir-apparent.\n\n\n== Return to Pagan and death ==\nIn 1167, Alaungsithu fell ill and was assassinated by Narathu who could not wait to be king. Min Shin Saw did not know about Narathu's treachery, and came back to Pagan to claim the throne. Narathu met him at the port, and proclaimed his elder brother the new king. Min Shin Saw was at once consecrated king. But later that night, Narathu poisoned Min Shin Saw, and claimed the throne for himself.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nCoed\u00e8s, George (1968).  Walter F. Vella (ed.).

    "Procaterol": "Procaterol is an intermediate-acting \u03b22 adrenoreceptor agonist used for the treatment of asthma. It has never been filed for FDA evaluation in the United States, where it is not marketed. The drug is readily oxidized in the presence of moisture and air, making it unsuitable for therapeutic use by inhalation. Pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis/Warner-Lambert researched a stabilizer to prevent oxidation, but an effective one was never developed.It was patented in 1974 and came into medical use in 1980.\n\n\n== Synthesis ==\nLike pirbuterol, procaterol exhibits similar broncholytic properties as salbutamol (albuterol), but it has somewhat of a more prolonged action. It is recommended for use as an inhaled drug for treating asthma.\n\n8-Hydroxycarbostyril 1 is acylated with 2-bromobutyric acid chloride 2 at the fifth position of the quinoline system, which gives the compound 3. This undergoes action of isopropylamine, forming an aminoketone, the carbonyl group of which is reduced by sodium borohydride, giving procaterol 4.\n\n\n== Names ==\nIt is also known as procaterol hydrochloride (USAN).\nProcaterol is available under a number of trade names (Onsukil, Masacin, Procadil and others), the most common seems to be Meptin ((KR), (CN), (ID), (MY), (PH), (SG), (TH), (HK)).\n\n\n== References ==",

It was 1966. This was one factor leading to the formation of Resist, which, Chomsky remembers, \"'very quickly became involved in other forms of resistance to illegitimate authority\" (31 Mar. 1995). One of the activities in which Resist became involved was the March on the Pentagon.\nIn addition to Chomsky and Lauter, others involved in the organization's early stages included novelist Mitchell Goodman, novelist Hans Koning, poet Robert Lowell, writer Dwight Macdonald, leading lawyer for the Mobilization's Legal Defense Committee Ed de Grazia, poet Denise Levertov, and The Armies of the Night author Norman MailerIn the days leading up to the march, the collective penned \"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority,\" which was published in the October 12th, 1967 edition of The New York Review of Books.  The manifesto was signed by hundreds including Mitchell Goodman,Marcus Raskin Henry Braun, Denise Levertov, Noam Chomsky, William Sloane Coffin, Norman Mailer, Robert Lowell, Dwight Macdonald, Allen Ginsberg, Barbara Guest, Wilbur H. Ferry, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti.  Leaflets were circulated among sympathizers prior to the march detailing their intended action:\n\nWE ARE PLANNING AN ACT OF DIRECT CREATIVE RESISTANCE TO THE WAR AND THE DRAFT IN WASHINGTON ON FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20. The locale of our action will be the Department of Justice. We will gather at the First United Congregational Church of Christ, 10th and G Streets, N.W., Washington ... at 1 P.M. We will appear at the Justice Department together with 30 or 40 young men brought by us to Washington to represent the 24 Resistance groups from all over the country. There we will present to the Attorney General the draft cards turned in locally by these groups on October 16 ... We will, in a clear, simple ceremony, make concrete our affirmation of support for these young men who are the spearhead of direct resistance to the war and all of its machinery. ... \n[Signed] Mitchell Goodman, Henry Braun, Denise Levertov, Noam Chomsky, William Sloane Coffin, Dwight Macdonald.\n\nNOTE: Among the hundreds already committed to this action are Robert Lowell, Norman Mailer, Ashley Montagu, Arthur Waskow, and professors from most of the major colleges and universities in the East.\nThe March was met with police aggression, resulting in the arrests of Mailer, Chomsky, Dave Dellinger, and Dagmar Wilson.\n\n\n=== The Boston Five ===\nThe publishing of \"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority\" led to the arrest of five of its signers, known as the Boston Five, in early 1968.  These were Michael Ferber, Dr. Benjamin Spock, William Sloan Coffin, Mitchell Goodman, and Marcus Raskin.  All five were members of RESIST.  The indictment came on counts of \"conspiring to 'counsel, aid, and abet' young men to refuse service in the armed forces and to refuse to have in their possession registration certificates and notices of classification.\"  The claims were met with opposition from anti-war sympathizers, including the some odd 200 members of RESIST.  The organization's associate national director and professor of Humanities at M.I.T. Louis Kampf held a press conference to address the organization's response to the indictments.  He stated that Resist was considering calling a national academic strike, and that a statement in support of the Five was gathering signatures.  The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was among the first to sign, \"declaring that he too should go to jail if the five under indictment are sentenced.\"  As reported in The Harvard Crimson:\n\nAccording to the indictment, Coffin, Goodman, Raskin, and Dr. Spock agreed to sponsor a nationwide draft-resistance program [RESIST] that would include disrupting the induction processes at various induction centers, making public appeals for young men to resist the draft and to refuse to serve in the military services, and issuing calls for registrants to turn in their draft cards ... Another \"overt act\" of the alleged conspiracy is the distribution in New York last August by Coffin and Dr. Spock of a statement entitled \"A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority.\"\nThe Boston Five were convicted of conspiracy in the courtroom of Francis Ford.\n\n\n=== COINTELPRO ===\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s RESIST received information from an underground group called \"The Citizen's Commission to Investigate the FBI\" regarding surveillance of various citizens and groups.  The documents included \"manuals and routine forms, 25 per cent concern bank robberies, 20 per cent murder, rape, and interstate theft, 7 per cent draft resistance, 7 per cent AWOL soldiers and 1 per cent organized crime, including gambling\".  In addition to these, intelligence was gathered about groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Jewish Defense League.  These documents were part of a larger FBI initiative called COINTELPRO; an acronym for COunter INTELligence PROgram.  The program \"was a secret FBI program designed to monitor and \"neutralize\" domestic groups deemed by the FBI to be a danger to national security. Such groups included anti-war groups and civil rights groups and individuals like Martin Luther King, Jr. and even Eleanor Roosevelt\"  RESIST was the first to release leaked information surrounding the covert initiative, leading to the formation of the Church committee: an investigative senatorial committee whose purpose was to flesh out the true story behind the allegations.  The allegations brought to light by RESIST turned out to be entirely correct, leading to the cessation of the program.\n\n\n== Today ==\nRESIST has moved away from its front lines activist roots and now seeks to fund those that continue that work.  In 2014, the organization gave 146 grants to grassroots activist organizations around the country, thanks to the help of over 7,000 donors, contributing an average gift of $129.00.  Resist has broadened in scope since its inception to include issues of environmentalism, the rights of women, prisoners, undocumented immigrants, the LGBTQ community, and worker's rights, among others. The organization continues to work to support the groups that are chopping down the pillars that prop up everything from militarism to capitalism, from racism to patriarchy, and the intersections that connect them all. There is a long list of organizations that have benefited from its efforts, including grantees such as:\n\nGlobal Exchange\nBlack Panther Party\nCentral Committee for Conscientious Objectors\nStudents for a Democratic Society\nThird World Newsreel\n9to5\nAmerican Indian Movement\nClamshell Alliance\nGay Liberation Front\nSouthern Student Organizing Committee\nUnited Farm Workers\nVietnam Veterans Against the War\nACT-UP\nCenter for Constitutional Rights\nCommittee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador\nWomen's International League for Peace and Freedom\nBlack Radical Congress\nJobs with Justice\nNARAL Pro-Choice America\nSchool of the Americas Watch\nCenter for Artistic Revolution\nCoalition Against Militarism in Our Schools\nCritical Resistance\nPrometheus Radio Project\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of anti-war organizations\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website",
    "Air Astana Flight 1388": "Air Astana Flight 1388 was a repositioning flight from Lisbon to Almaty, with a refueling stopover at Minsk. On 11 November 2018, shortly after takeoff it suffered severe control issues. After 90 minutes it landed safely at Beja Airbase.\n\n\n== Aircraft and crew ==\nP4-KCJ, the incident aircraft, was an Embraer ERJ-190LR. Prior to the incident it had accumulated a total of 13,152 flight hours.The plane was flown by Captain Vyacheslav Aushev, First officer Bauyrzhan Karasholakov and First officer in jumpseat Sergey Sokolov.\n\n\n== Maintenance ==\nOn 2 October 2018 the aircraft arrived at Alverca Air Base to undergo heavy maintenance. The maintenance consisted of accomplishing several service bulletins. On 9 October the overhaul of aileron cables was initiated. The first service bulletin consisted of replacing pulleys and structural supports of the cables. The second one consisted of replacing the stainless steel cables with carbon steel cables. The cables were also lubricated.On October 26 during operational tests, a warning message (FLT CTR NO DISPATCH) alerted the maintenance crew that the aircraft was unfit for flight due to control system problems. The warning occurred again on 31 October. The troubleshooting lasted until 11 November, the date of the incident.\n\n\n== Flight ==\nThe aircraft took off at 13:31, with the crew failing to detect the ailerons' anomaly during the operational check procedures. Visibility was limited - between 2000-3000m. Shortly after take-off the pilots noticed severe control issues. The pilots tried to turn on the autopilot, but it failed to engage. At 13:37 the crew requested a climb to FL 100 and an immediate return to Alverca, reporting flight control problems. At several instances the plane suffered complete loss of control, flipping over and diving sharply placing massive stress on the airframe. The crew requested a heading to the sea so they could ditch if it became inevitable, but struggled to comply with any headings given by ATC due to their difficulty controlling the aircraft.\nThe crew discussed the options available to them, with the First Officer that was in the jumpseat coordinating with the technicians on board as passengers to discover the cause of the upsets and establish an action plan. Despite no warnings indicating issues with normal mode, the crew activated the direct mode for flight controls which disconnects the FCM (flight control module) from the controls. This considerably increased controllability of the pitch and yaw-axes, but control of the roll-axis was still limited with the plane rolling abnormally as the spoilers would actuate and upset the aircraft with too much input. The crew flew the plane east, hoping to find better weather conditions. Two F-16s from the Portuguese Air Force took off from Monte Real Air Base to escort the aircraft to Beja Airbase. After two go-arounds due to unstable approach, the First Officer in the active role changed places with the other First Officer in the jumpseat. On the final approach, the plane was bound for runway 19R but eventually landed on 19L due to the aircraft drifting on the approach. \nWhile all on board were shaken, there were no injuries apart from one passenger who suffered a leg injury. The hull was deformed and the leading edges of the wing were wrinkled. Some parts of the aircraft suffered loads greater than what they were designed for. The aircraft was written off and subsequently scrapped.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nThe investigation revealed that the aileron cables were installed incorrectly. This caused reversal of aileron controls. Since the roll control surfaces include spoilers, which weren't affected by the mistake, the situation couldn't have been handled with just reversing inputs.The investigation blamed the manufacturer of the airplane for the poorly made maintenance instructions, the supervising authorities for lack of oversight over the maintenance crew, who lacked the skill to perform the heavy maintenance, and the flight crew for failing to notice the condition during pre-flight control checks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChina Northwest Airlines Flight 2303\nForced landing of a German Air Force Bombardier Global 5000 with partly reversed flight controls\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Kaut": "Kart racing or karting is a variant of motorsport road racing with open-wheel, four-wheeled vehicles known as go-karts or shifter karts. They are usually raced on scaled-down circuits, although some professional kart races are also held on full-size motorsport circuits. Karting is commonly perceived as the stepping stone to the higher ranks of motorsports, with many former and current Formula One drivers such as Sebastian Vettel, Nico Rosberg, Ayrton Senna, Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Fernando Alonso, having begun their careers in karting.\nKarts vary widely in speed and some (known as superkarts) can reach speeds exceeding 161 kilometres per hour (100 mph), while recreational go-karts intended for the general public may be limited to lower speeds.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAmerican Art Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting. A veteran hot rodder and a race car builder at Kurtis Kraft, he built the first kart in Southern California in 1956. Early karting events were held in the Rose Bowl Stadium car park. Instantly popular, Karting rapidly spread to other countries, and currently has a large following in Europe.\nThe first kart manufacturer was an American company, Go Kart Manufacturing Co. (1957). In 1959, McCulloch was the first company to produce engines for karts. Its first engine, the McCulloch MC-10, was an adapted chainsaw two-stroke engine. Later, in the 1960s, motorcycle engines were also adapted for kart use, before dedicated manufacturers, especially in Italy (IAME), started to build engines for the sport.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\n\n=== Chassis ===\nThe chassis are made of chrome moly tubing. There is no suspension, so chassis have to be flexible enough to work as a suspension and stiff enough not to break or give way on a turn. Kart chassis are classified in the United States as \"Open\", \"Caged\", \"Straight\" or \"Offset\". All Commission Internationale de Karting - F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile or CIK-FIA approved chassis are \"Straight\" and \"Open\".\n\nOpen karts have no roll cage.\nCaged karts have a roll cage surrounding the driver; they are mostly used on dirt tracks.\nIn Straight chassis the driver sits in the center. Straight chassis are used for sprint racing.\nIn Offset chassis the driver sits on the left side. Offset chassis are used for left-turn-only speedway racing.The stiffness of the chassis enables different handling characteristics for different circumstances. Typically, for dry conditions a stiffer chassis is preferable, while in wet or other poor traction conditions, a more flexible chassis may work better. Temperature of the track can also affect handling and may prompt additional chassis adjustments. The best chassis allow for stiffening bars at the rear, front and side to be added or removed according to race conditions.Braking is achieved by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front and one for the rear and are adjustable to allow for front/rear bias changes.\nProfessionally raced karts typically weigh 165 to 175 lb (75 to 79 kg), complete without driver. Avanti, Tony Kart, Trulli, Birel, CRG, Gillard, Intrepid, Remo Racing, Kosmic, Zanardi or FA Kart and EKS are a few well-known examples of the many European manufacturers of race-quality chassis. Emmick, Coyote, Bandit, Shadow, MGM, Titan, PRC and Margay are American companies producing kart chassis.\n\n\n=== Engines ===\n\nAmusement park go-karts can be powered by four-stroke engines or electric motors, while racing karts use small two-stroke or four-stroke engines.\n\nFour-stroke engines can be standard air-cooled industrial based engines, sometimes with small modifications, developing from about 5 to 20 hp. Briggs & Stratton, Tecumseh, Kohler, Robin, and Honda are manufacturers of such engines. They are adequate for racing and fun kart applications. There are also more powerful four-stroke engines available from manufacturers like Yamaha, TKM, Swissauto or Aixro (Wankel engine) offering from 15 hp up to 48 hp. They run to and around 11,000 rpm, and are manufactured specifically for karting. Those are used in some National Championship classes like the two-strokes.\nTwo-stroke kart engines are developed and built by dedicated manufacturers. WTP, Comer, IAME (Parilla, Komet, Woltjer), TM, Vortex, Titan, REFO, Modena Engines, TKM, Yamaha are manufacturers of such engines. These can develop from about 8 hp for a single-cylinder 60 cc unit (MiniROK by Vortex) to over 90 hp for a twin 250 cc.< Today, the most popular categories worldwide are those using the TaG 125 cc units. The recent 125 cc KF1 engines are electronically limited at 16,000 rpm. Most are water-cooled today; however, previously air-cooled engines dominated the sport.\n\n\n=== Transmission ===\nPurpose of transmission: There are three reasons for having a transmission in the automotive power train or drive train. The transmission can:\n\nProvide torque needed to move the vehicle under a velocity of road and load conditions. It does this by changing the gear ratio between the engine crankshaft and vehicle drive wheel.\nBe shifted into reverse so the vehicle can move backward.\nBe shifted into neutral for starting the engine and running it without turning the drive wheels.Karts do not have a differential. The lack of a differential means that one rear tire must slide while cornering. This is achieved by designing the chassis so that the inside rear tire lifts up slightly when the kart turns the corner. This allows the tire to lose some of its grip and slide or lift off the ground completely.\nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by a chain. Both engine and axle sprockets are removable. Their ratio must be adapted to the track configuration to obtain the most performance from the engine.\nIn the early days, karts were direct drive, requiring push starts. The inconvenience of that configuration led to the centrifugal clutch for the club level classes. Dry centrifugal clutches are now used in many categories; Rotax Max is one example. They have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125 cc clutch-equipped engines as of January 2007.\n\n\n=== Tires ===\nWheels and tires are much smaller than those used on a normal car. Wheels are made of magnesium alloy, aluminum, or composite materials. Tires can support cornering forces in excess of 2 g (20 m/s\u00b2), depending on chassis, engine, and motor setup. Some car tire manufacturers, such as Bridgestone, Dunlop, and Maxxis make tires for karts. There are also specific kart tire manufacturers, which include MG, MOJO, Vega,Cobra, Hoosier and Burris.\nSimilarly to other motorsports, kart tires have different types for use appropriate to track conditions:\n\nSlicks, for dry track. Slick kart tires come in many different compounds, from very soft (maximum grip) to very hard (amusement and rental karts, less grip but long life span). In international level racing, because the drivers are free to choose their tires and because of the short duration of each round (10 to 20 minutes maximum), these are some of the softest tires found in motorsport.\nRain tires, or \"wets\", for wet weather. They are grooved, made of soft compound, and are narrower than slicks. Not all racing classes allow rain tires.\nSpecial, such as spiked tires for icy conditions, or \"cuts/grooved\" for high grip dirt/clay speedways. Cuts are slicks modified with a lathe to optimize handling. Tire manufacturers such as Hoosier and Burris also make a slightly larger grooved tire only used in dirt track racing.\n\n\n=== Data acquisition ===\nAs in other motor sports, several data acquisition systems have been developed for kart racing. These systems allow the driver to monitor from a display fixed on the steering wheel some parameters such as RPM, timing of laps (including sectors), number of laps, best lap, cooling system temperature, exhaust gas temperature and sometimes speed or even gear for shifter karts.\nSome of those systems are able to record (logging) laps data from the sensors, allowing replay of an entire running session or/and direct download to a personal computer equipped with a data analysis software. More sophisticated systems allow for more information such as lateral and longitudinal acceleration (g-force), throttle position, steering wheel position and brake pressure.\n\n\n== Racing ==\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of motorsport available on four wheels. As a free-time activity, it can be performed by almost anybody, and as a motorsport in itself, it is one of the sports regulated by FIA (under the name of CIK), permitting licensed racing for anyone from the age of 8 onward.\nIn the United States, there is not as much FIA involvement; instead, many organizations regulate racing, such as the IKF (International Kart Federation), WKA (World Karting Association), KART (Karters of America Racing Triad), USPKS (United States Pro Karting Series).\nIn the UK, the Motor Sports Association (MSA) regulates most \"owner driver\" Karting. Some associations, such as NatSKA (National Schools Karting Association), organize race meetings throughout the country under the authority of the MSA.\nVarious four-stroke \"hire kart\" series such as EPEC (European Prokart Endurance Championship) or BRKC (British Rental Kart Championship) fall outside the governance of the MSA. Billed as the UK's first national karting league, the Elite Karting League also falls outside of MSA governance.\nIn Australia, kart racing is administered by the one of the following Karting bodies:\nAustralian Auto Sport Alliance - 6 clubs\nAustralian Independent Dirt Kart Association - 19 clubs\nAustralian Kart Racers Alliance - 3 clubs\nKarting Australia - 6 state associations (previously known as Australian Karting Association granted rights for CIK-FIA racing via Motorsport Australia)\nKarting NSW - 24 clubs, separated from Australian Karting Association in 2019\nSpeedway Karting Association of Australia - 16 clubs\nWheatbelt Dirt Karting Association - 4 clubs\nUnaffiliated - 8 clubsRacing classes start at age 7 or 8 (5 in the United States with \"Kid Karts\") and generally run in 3-year age groupings or weight divisions until \"senior\" status is reached at age 15 or 16, depending on the series.\n\n\n=== Racing formats ===\nTypically, race formats are one of the following:\n\n\n==== Sprint ====\n\nSprint racing takes place on dedicated kart circuits resembling small road courses, with left and right turns. Tracks range from 1/4-mile (400 metres) to over 1 mile (1,600 metres) in length.\nThe sprint format is a series of short-duration races, normally for a small number of laps, that qualify for a final, with a variety of point scoring calculations to determine the event's overall winner. Typical duration does not normally exceed 15 minutes. Here, speed and successful passing is of the most importance. It normally occurs in the format of three qualifying heats and a final race for trophy positions.\nThe FIA championships, including the Karting World Championship, take place in this format.\n\n\n==== Endurance ====\n\nEndurance races last for an extended period, ranging from 30 minutes up to 24 hours or more, for one or more drivers. In general, consistency, reliability, and pit strategy is of greater importance than all out speed.\nCalled \"enduro\" racing in the United States, most WKA and IKF sanctioned events typically last 30 minutes (sprint enduro) or 45 minutes (laydown enduro) and are run continuously without pit stops. Enduro events are held on full-size road racing circuits that are usually between 1.5 and 4 miles in length.\nAs well as the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race for automobiles there is also a 24-hours event for karts which takes place at the kart circuit Alain Prost at Le Mans, France. This race has taken place since 1986 and its winners list include four-time Champ Car champion S\u00e9bastien Bourdais (in 1996).\nEndurance racing is also considered a more affordable way of getting into karting. In South Africa, the 24 Hours of Karting Festival race is held annually and lasts 24 hours with multiple classes participating. This event is hosted by the Prokart SSS Club near Johannesburg. The most popular class runs the Honda GX390 four-stroke engine, which is both affordable and durable, keeping running costs to a minimum. The Prokart Super Single Series, also known as Prokart SSS, has been running for more than 20 years and has proven to be a very popular entry platform for drivers of all ages who want to get into karting. Many clubs worldwide have taken on four-stroke endurance karting for this reason, since two-stroke karting can be very expensive.\n\n\n==== Speedway ====\nSpeedway racing takes place on asphalt or clay oval tracks which are normally between 1/10-mile and 1/4-mile long. Tracks primarily consist of two straights and four left-turn corners, few tracks are symmetric and often the shape parallels that of an egg or a tri-oval.\n\"Offset\" kart chassis have been developed for precise handling and adjustability in left-turn-only racing competition taking place on oval and tri-oval tracks. Depending on the track material, different tires are used on the kart.Speedway kart races range in length from 4 laps for a trophy dash, to 20 laps for a main event.\nThe two chief racing formats used in dirt speedway karting are heat races and timed laps qualification:\n\nThe International Kart Federation (IKF) runs a racing format of two 10 lap heats followed by a 20 lap final. Finishing positions in the two heat races are used to calculate the starting position in the feature race.\nThe World Karting Association (WKA) uses time qualifying. Karts equipped with transponders are sent out onto the track in groups of 5 or less to try to achieve the fastest lap time. Positions for the 20 laps feature event are determined by qualifying time.\nThe American Kart Racing Association (AKRA) uses group transponder qualifying to calculate starting positions for 20-lap features.\n\n\n=== Racing categories ===\nThere are many different classes in kart. One of the fastest growing in the United States is Lo206. The general classes are 125cc Shifter, 100cc tag, 125cc tag and then the X30 equivalents of these karts.\n\n\n==== International ====\n\nThe CIK-FIA sanctions international championships in OK, OKJ, KZ1, KZ2 and Superkart. These are regarded as the top-level classes of karting and are also raced in national championships worldwide. The World Championship is decided here. In May 2019 it held the international under-15 championship. The driver who finished first overall was Vlad Sputzki (Russia) followed by Daniel Smith (England) and then followed by Maximileleitna Banks (Australia)\nCIK-FIA categories:\n\nOK (the top level) and OKJ for a younger age group. All are using the same water-cooled no-gearbox 125 cc \"long life\" two-stroke engines, which are direct drive, each with different technical specifications covering mufflers, air boxes, carburetor, speed limiters, etc.\nKZ1 and KZ2, both 125 cc gearbox categories.\nSuperkart, a 250 cc gearbox category.Non CIK-FIA categories:\nThe Kart World Championship (or KWC) as opposed to the FIA's \"Karting World Championship\" uses 4-stroke rental karts and travels to a different country each year.\n\n\n==== National ====\nIn the UK, the most celebrated karting series is the National karting series, also known as Super One. There are three types of Super One championships:\n\nMSA series: KF2, KF3, Formula KGP, Super Cadet, Cadet & Bambino\nRotax series: Minimax, Junior Max, Senior Max, Senior Max 177\nTKM series: Formula Junior TKM, Formula TKM Extreme, TKM Senior 4-stroke and since 2006, Honda CadetOther UK National Championships include:\nBirel BirelART series UK: Cadet 60cc, Junior 100cc, Senior Light 125cc, Senior Heavy 125cc\nThe BRKC is the UK's rental karting National championship, and the UK's official feeder series to the rental Kart World Championship.\nNatSKA is a budget karting association set up for schools and youth groups in the UK, with 13 classes.\nIn the United States, Dirt oval classes (which often use Briggs & Stratton industrial engines) are prominent in the Southeast and Midwest. In the West, European style sprint racing is much more common. In particular, 125cc shifter karts using Honda CR125 power units have gained tremendous popularity in recent years.In Australia, classes include Cadet (previously called Midget),Junior KA4, Junior KA3, X30, KZ2, Senior KA3, Senior TAG (Restricted and Unrestricted). Most classes run a light and heavy category.\nMany people race worldwide in Spec series such as X30 125cc (a TaG class).\n\n\n=== Racing licences ===\nAs in other disciplines in motorsports, a license is required to drive a racing kart on a circuit or enter competitions. The licenses, issued by governing bodies, are provided by clubs or associations. Basic insurance coverage is usually included in the licence annual fee. In some countries, such as France, regulations require the drivers to pass a medical exam each year.\nLicense classes differ between countries according to age groups or levels. Most of the time a Practice License can be easily obtained, while a Racing License might require a capability assessment.\n\n\n=== Driver equipment ===\nFor their safety, kart drivers are required to wear proper equipment:\nFull-face helmet (Snell SA2005 or K2005 certification is required for racing, K2005 is same as SA2005 without fire resistance)\nRacing balaclava\nDriving suit (abrasion resistant overalls with at least one Cordura external layer, CIK-FIA Level 2 homologation for top level racing)\nGloves\nDriving boots (ankles must be covered)Rib protector and neck brace, although highly recommended, are optional in most countries. None of the above need to be made of fire retardant material. Superkart drivers are required to wear leather overalls, similar to those used in motorcycling.\n\n\n== As a learning tool ==\nKart racing is usually used as a low-cost and relatively safe way to introduce drivers to motor racing. Drivers can start at the age of 6 in the Motorsport UK Bambino Championship, and even from the age of 5 in the Bambino Kart Club Championship. Many Formula One drivers grew up racing karts, most prominent among them being World Champions Ayrton Senna, Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost, Fernando Alonso, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. Many NASCAR drivers also got their start in racing from karts, such as Darrell Waltrip, Danica Patrick, Ricky Rudd, Juan Pablo Montoya, Tony Stewart, and Jeff Gordon. \nIn August 2009, in anticipation to a possible return to F1 with Ferrari, Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher did some preparation driving a kart in Lonato, Italy. Schumacher also raced at the SKUSA SuperNationals, an event taking place each year in Las Vegas, along with F1 drivers S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Nelson Piquet Jr.. Felipe Massa also used karting in September 2009 to test his condition in Brazil, two months after his Hungarian Grand Prix accident during qualifying.\n\n\n== Recreational, concession and indoor Karts ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nKart circuit\nKart manufacturers\nKart Racing ChampionshipsRelated:\n\nCapeta\nCrosskart\nGo-kart\nKart racing game\nMicro kart\nSmall engine\nSuperkart\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKartingForum.co.uk Your #1 Karting Community!\nKarting Classifieds Karts and Karting related items for sale or wanted.\nKart Directory UK The Home For British Karters.\nKartpulse a worldwide resource for new and existing kart racers.\nKart racing at CurlieGoverning Bodies:\n\nMotorsport UK Bambino Championship - Motorsport UK Bambino Championship\ncorporate sports league web site\nCIK-FIA web site\nMSA \u2013 Motor Sports Association \u2013 Governing body for motor sports in Great Britain\nIKF \u2013 International Kart Federation \u2013 Governing body for the sport of kart racing in the US, mainly West Coast\nWKA \u2013 World Karting Association \u2013 Governing body for karting in the US, mainly East Coast\nAKRA \u2013 American Kart Racing Association \u2013 Governing body for speedway oval karting in the US\nAKA \u2013 Australian Karting Association \u2013 Governing body for karting in Australia\nASN Canada \u2013 Governing body for kart racing in Canada\nNatSKA \u2013 National Association of Schools and Youth Group Karting \u2013 UK\nVKA \u2013 Vintage Karting Association \u2013 Association for support of karts from karting's 1956 inception to 1975",

    "1903 Cumberland Bulldogs football team": "The 1903 Cumberland Bulldogs football team represented Cumberland University in the 1903 college football season. The team was a member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), compiling a 6\u20131\u20131 record.  The Bulldogs notably beat Vanderbilt and tied John Heisman's Clemson at year's end in a game billed as the \"SIAA Championship Game.\" They also beat Alabama, LSU, and Tulane in five days. The school claims a share of the SIAA title. It has been called \"the best football team in the history of Cumberland.\"\n\n\n== Before the season ==\nFor the 1903 season, point values were different from those used in contemporary games. In 1903 a touchdown was worth five points, a field goal was worth five points and a conversion (PAT) was worth one point.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n Games with Kentucky State College and Kentucky University were canceled.\n\n\n== Season summary ==\n\n\n=== at Vanderbilt ===\nCumberland upset the Vanderbilt Commodores 6\u20130. Four minutes after the game started, Waterhouse had the decisive touchdown. M. O. Bridges had his right collarbone broken.The starting lineup was Waterhouse (left end), M. L. Bridges (left tackle), James (left guard), Smith (center), Cragwall (right guard), Suddarth (right tackle), Spencer (right end), Smiser (quarterback), Head (left halfback), Newton (right halfback), M. O. Bridges (fullback).\n\n\n=== Sewanee ===\nCumberland suffered the season's only loss to the Sewanee Tigers. Henry D. Phillips plowed through the line for the deciding score.The starting lineup was Waterhouse (left end), M. L. Bridges (left tackle), James (left guard), Smith (center), Cragwall (right guard), Suddarth (right tackle), Spencer (right end), Smiser (quarterback), Head (left halfback), Anderson (right halfback), Minton (fullback).\n\n\n=== Tennessee Medical College ===\nCumberland defeated Tennessee Medical College 86\u20130.

Cumberland rushed out to an early 11 to 0 lead. Wiley Lee Umphlett in Creating the Big Game: John W. Heisman and the Invention of American Football writes, \"During the first half, Clemson was never really in the game due mainly to formidable line play of the Bridges brothers\u2013giants in their day at 6 feet 4 inches\u2013and a big center named \"Red\" Smith, was all over the field backing up the Cumberland line on defense. Clemson had been outweighed before, but certainly not like this.\"A contemporary account reads \"The Clemson players seemed mere dwarfs as they lined up for the kickoff. To the crowd on the sidelines it didn't seem that Heisman's charges could possibly do more than give a gallant account of themselves in a losing battle.\" A touchdown was scored by fullback E. L. Minton (touchdowns were worth 5 points). Guard M. O. Bridges kicked the extra point. Halfback J. A. Head made another touchdown, but Bridges missed the try. \n\nAfter halftime, Clemson quarterback John Maxwell raced 100 yards for a touchdown. Clemson missed the try. Cumberland fumbled a punt and Clemson recovered.  Cumberland expected a trick play when Fritz Furtick simply ran up the middle and scored. One account of the play reads \"Heisman saw his chance to exploit a weakness in the Cumberland defense: run the ball where the ubiquitous Red Smith wasn't. So the next time Sitton started out on one of his slashing end runs, at the last second he tossed he ball back to the fullback who charges straight over center (where Smith would have been except that he was zeroing in on the elusive Sitton) and went all the way for he tying touchdown.\" Jock Hanvey kicked the extra point and the game ended in an 11\u201311 tie. The winning team was to be awarded the ball. Captain W. W. Suddarth of Cumberland wanted captain Hope Sadler of Clemson to get the ball, and Sadler insisted Suddarth should have it.  Some ten minutes of bickering was resolved when the ball was given to patrolman Patrick J. Sweeney, for warning the media and fans to stay down in front and allow spectators to see the game. Heisman pushed for Cumberland to be named SIAA champions at year's end, and the school claims a share of the title. It was Heisman's last game as Clemson head coach.The starting lineup was Waterhouse (left end), M. L. Bridges (left tackle), M. O.

    "2021 Caribbean Club Championship": "The 2021 Caribbean Club Championship (officially the 2021 Flow CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship for sponsorship reasons) was the 23rd edition of the Caribbean Club Championship (also known as the CFU Club Championship), the first-tier annual international club football competition in the Caribbean region, held amongst clubs whose football associations are affiliated with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), a sub-confederation of CONCACAF.\nThe tournament was played in the Dominican Republic between 15 and 25 May 2021. As a result of the cancellation of the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship was expanded to include a number of teams originally set to participate in the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield.The winners of the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship qualified to the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League, and the second, third and fourth place teams qualified to the 2021 CONCACAF League, as long as they comply with the minimum CONCACAF Club Licensing requirements for the CONCACAF Champions League or CONCACAF League.Portmore United, having won the title in 2019, are the title holders. The 2020 edition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the title was not awarded.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\nA total of 13 teams from 11 associations entered the expanded 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship.\nAmong the 31 CFU member associations, four of them were classified as professional leagues and each may enter two teams in the CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship. Before the expansion of the tournament, six teams from three associations originally entered. However, the two teams from Jamaica later withdrew, and only four teams from two associations (Dominican Republic and Haiti) entered the expanded tournament.\nOriginally, a total of 14 teams from 14 associations which were classified as non-professional leagues entered the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield. After its cancellation, 9 of the 14 teams instead participated in the expanded 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship. Initially, 11 teams would participate, but Racing Club Aruba (Aruba), South East (Dominica) and Platinum FC (Saint Lucia) withdrew, while Hope International (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) were added.\nAssociation with professional league whose teams did not enter Trinidad and TobagoNotes\n\n\n== Venues ==\nThe matches were played at the F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez Olympic Stadium in Santo Domingo and Estadio Panamericano in San Crist\u00f3bal.\n\n\n== Original format ==\nBefore the expansion of the tournament, the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Championship would originally be played at the F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez Olympic Stadium in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, between 14 and 26 May 2021, and six teams from three associations entered. The original draw for the group stage was held on 25 February 2021, 11:00 EST (UTC\u22125), at the CONCACAF Headquarters in Miami, United States. The six teams were drawn into two groups of three. The two teams from hosts Dominican Republic were placed in Pot 1, the two teams from Haiti were placed in Pot 2, while the two teams from Jamaica were placed in Pot 3. This ensured that teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group.\n\nThe original draw results and schedule were as follows:\nGroup stage\nGroup A:  Universidad O&M,  Cavaly,  Portmore United\n14 May 2021, 18:30: Universidad O&M v Cavaly\n16 May 2021, 18:30: Cavaly v Portmore United\n18 May 2021, 18:30: Universidad O&M v Portmore United\nGroup B:  Delfines del Este,  Don Bosco,  Waterhouse\n14 May 2021, 21:00: Delfines del Este v Don Bosco\n16 May 2021, 21:00: Don Bosco v Waterhouse\n18 May 2021, 21:00: Delfines del Este v Waterhouse\nKnockout stage\nSemi-finals\n21 May 2021, 18:30: Group A Winners v Group B Runners-up\n21 May 2021, 21:00: Group B Winners v Group A Runners-up\nThird place match\n23 May 2021, 17:00: Semi-final 1 Losers v Semi-final 2 Losers\nFinal\n23 May 2021, 20:00: Semi-final 1 Winners v Semi-final 2 Winners\nCONCACAF League playoff\n26 May 2021, 20:00: Club Championship 4th place v Club Shield Winners\n\n\n== Group stage ==\nAfter the expansion of the tournament, the new draw for the group stage was held on 23 April 2021, 11:00 EDT (UTC\u22124), at the CONCACAF Headquarters in Miami, United States.

The four teams from the Dominican Republic and Haiti were placed in Pot 1 and drawn to position 1 of the four groups. The 11 teams originally set to participate in the 2021 CONCACAF Caribbean Club Shield were placed in Pot 2 and drawn to positions 2, 3 and 4 of the four groups. This ensured that teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group.\n\nAfter the draw was made, Hope International (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) were added to Group D, and each group would have four teams. Later, Racing Club Aruba (Aruba) and Platinum FC (Saint Lucia) withdrew, and there were only two teams left in Group B. To ensure that each group had a minimum of three teams, a draw was held on 13 May 2021 to relocate a team from Group A to Group B, and Metropolitan (Puerto Rico) were moved.

    "Beltrami Island State Forest": "The Beltrami Island State Forest is a state forest located in Lake of the Woods, Roseau, and Beltrami counties, Minnesota. Named after Italian explorer Giacomo Beltrami, it is the second-largest state forest in the Minnesota system after Pine Island State Forest. The largest wildlife management area in the state at 321,149 acres (129,964 ha), the Red Lake Wildlife Management Area, is located within the forest. The majority of the forest is managed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, although a significant portion are tribal lands belonging to the neighboring Red Lake Band of Ojibwe.\nFrench explorers came to the area around 1730 in their search for a route to the Pacific Ocean, retaining control of the area via the fur trade until after 1760, when the British Hudson's Bay Company gained control of the area. The Treaty of 1818 gave the Americans technical control over the area, although the Ojibwe retained control over the land until ceding all their holdings in the Red River Valley as a result of the Treaty of Old Crossing in 1863.\nThe majority of land in the forest is coniferous swamp dominated by species such as black spruce, tamarack, and northern white cedar, although red pine, jack pine, and aspen exist in upland areas. Much of the pine that characterizes the upland acreage were planted by the federal Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, based out of Norris Camp now located in the Red Lake WMA portion of the forest. Within the perimeters of the forest are the headwaters of the Roseau River, Warroad River, North Branch Rapid River, and Moose River. All rivers ultimately drain northward into Hudson Bay due to the forest's location north of the Laurentian Divide.\nOutdoor recreation activities include hiking and mountain biking on provided trails, as well as backcountry camping. Trails include 25 miles (40 km) of hiking, 27 miles (43 km) of horseback riding, 238 miles (383 km) available for Class I and II all-terrain vehicle use as well as dirt biking, and 138 miles (222 km) for snowmobiling. Nearby Zippel Bay State Park and adjacent Hayes Lake State Park have facilities suitable for camping.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Minnesota state forests\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBeltrami Island State Forest - Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)",

    "John Densmore": "John Paul Densmore (born December 1, 1944) is an American musician, songwriter, author and actor. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band the Doors, and as such is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He appeared on every recording made by the band, with drumming inspired by jazz and world music as much as by rock and roll.\nDensmore is also noted for his veto of attempts by the other two Doors members, in the wake of singer Jim Morrison's 1971 death, to accept offers to license the rights to various Doors songs for commercial purposes, as well as his objections to their use in the 21st century of the Doors name and logo. Densmore's lengthy court battles to gain compliance with his veto, based on a 1960s contract requiring unanimity among Doors members to use the band's name or music, ended with total victory for him and his allies in the Morrison estate.Densmore has worked additionally in the performing arts as a dancer and actor, and written successfully as both a playwright and the author of two books on the topic of the Doors, and a third book, The Seekers (2020), on a selection of notable people he has worked with and encountered.\nThe many honors he shares with the other Doors include a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nDensmore was born in Los Angeles on December 1, 1944, to a Catholic family. He grew up playing piano and later took up drums/percussion for the marching band at his school. He also played timpani in orchestra. Densmore attended Santa Monica City College and California State University, Northridge; at the latter he studied ethnic music under jazz cellist Fred Katz.\n\nDensmore's drumming influences included hard jazz figures Elvin Jones (drummer for John Coltrane), whom he referred to as his idol, and Art Blakey.\n\n\n== The Doors ==\n\nIn the mid-1960s Densmore joined guitarist Robby Krieger in a band called the Psychedelic Rangers; shortly thereafter he began rehearsals with keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Manzarek's two brothers and Jim Morrison in the group Rick & the Ravens.  On the brothers' departure from the band, Densmore recommended Krieger join them, thus forming the Doors in 1965.In 2010 Modern Drummer magazine referred to his ride cymbal work as some of the most distinctive in classic rock, and noted \"Working without a regular bass-playing foil ... Densmore favored a lean, crisp, clear style in feel-good rhythmic explorations that, like the band's songs, gathered together ideas from blues, pop, jazz, classical, and Latin, Eastern, and African music. There are many reasons to love this slyly inventive, often underrated drummer.\" Together with Krieger, Densmore studied under Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar at the latter's Kinnara School of Music in Los Angeles.\n\nThe quartet, after two years of work, became star attractions in 1967, and released six studio and several live albums, eventually selling over 100 million units.According to Densmore's autobiography, he had quit the band on one occasion in reaction to Morrison's increasingly self-destructive behavior, although Densmore returned the next day. Densmore repeatedly suggested that the band stop touring, but Krieger and Manzarek were resistant to this notion. After the Doors' disastrous performance with a gibberish-spouting Morrison in New Orleans on December 12, 1970, the band agreed to stop performing live, and the concert was the Doors' last public appearance as a quartet.When Morrison died in 1971, the surviving trio recorded two more albums of songs and an instrumental backdrop for the late singer's recorded poetry. Densmore remained a member until the band's dissolution in 1973.\n\n\n== Later career ==\nDensmore formed a musical group with fellow ex-Doors member Krieger in 1973 called the Butts Band. The group released two albums with two different lineups, and disbanded in 1975. Densmore left rock and roll in the 1980s, moving to the world of dance as he performed with Bess Snyder and Co., touring the United States for two years.In 1984, at La Mama Theatre in New York, he made his stage acting debut in Skins, a one-act play he had written. In 1985, he won the LA Weekly Theater Award for music with Methusalem, directed by Tim Robbins. The play Rounds, which he co-produced, won the NAACP award for theatre in 1987. In 1988, he played a feature role in Band Dreams and Bebop at the Gene Dynarski Theatre. He developed and performed a one-man piece from the Donald Barthelme short story, The King of Jazz, at the Wallenboyd Theatre in 1989. With Adam Ant, he co-produced Be Bop A Lula at Theatre Theatre in 1992. He has acted in numerous TV shows, most memorably as himself in the show Square Pegs, working as a drummer for Johnny Slash's band Open 24 Hours, and in an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 in 1992, in Series 2, Episode 23, where he plays Ben, Dylan's sponsor.\nHis film credits include Get Crazy with Malcolm McDowell, Dudes directed by Penelope Spheeris, and The Doors directed by Oliver Stone. In the Stone film he was portrayed by actor Kevin Dillon. He also produced and co-scored the feature film, Window of Opportunity, a dark comedy about corporate greed written and directed by Samuel Warren Joseph.\nDensmore wrote his best-selling autobiography, Riders on the Storm (1990), about his life and the time he spent with Morrison and the Doors. In the first chapter Densmore describes the solemn day on which he and the band finally visited Morrison's grave around three years after Morrison's death.\nDensmore's other books include The Seekers (2020) in which he discusses notable people in his life that have made a great impact on him and others.Densmore appears alongside Krieger and Manzarek in 2012's RE:GENERATION, a documentary directed by Amir Bar-Lev. It features Densmore collaborating on a new song with Skrillex.\n\n\n=== Stand against commercialization ===\nDensmore, Manzarek and Krieger, after Jim Morrison's death, allowed \"Riders on the Storm\" to be used to sell Pirelli Tyres, but in the United Kingdom only.  Densmore later stated that he \"heard Jim's voice\" in his ears and ended up donating his share of the money earned to charity. In 2003, Densmore vetoed an offer by Cadillac of $15 million for \"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\" citing Morrison's historic and vehement opposition to licensing the Doors' music, notably their best-selling single \"Light My Fire\" for a Buick television commercial, as well as Densmore's strong negative views on the subject of commercially licensing Doors songs and recordings. Densmore also objected to Manzarek and Krieger touring using the name \"Doors of the 21st Century.\"\nIn a subsequent court case, in which Densmore was joined by the Morrison estate, opposing lawyers attempted to portray Densmore as un-American, a communist and an eco-terrorist. Notable musicians who testified in support of Densmore included Bonnie Raitt, Randy Newman, Neil Young, Tom Petty, Eddie Vedder and Tom Waits. Former drummer for the Police, Stewart Copeland, who had performed with Krieger and Manzarek in 2002 and 2003, also testified in Densmore's and the Morrison estate's behalf.In 2013 Densmore released The Doors Unhinged, a book covering his lengthy but victorious legal battle with Krieger and Manzarek over their use of the Doors' name and logo in their touring and Densmore's veto of the Cadillac commercial offer. Manzarek and Densmore reconciled shortly before Manzarek's death in 2013. Densmore and Krieger have occasionally appeared together on stage again.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nAs a member of the Doors, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. Along with his 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Densmore, as a member of the Doors, was recognized in 2007 with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also in 2007, Densmore and his band mates were awarded a Grammy Award for lifetime achievement. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame webpage on the Doors observes that \"As a drummer, Densmore had a creative, dynamic flair that lent itself to the Doors' surreal, kaleidoscopic music.\"He and the Doors have been saluted twice by the City of Los Angeles, which in 2017 issued a proclamation at a public gathering in Venice Beach observing January 4 as the 'Day of the Doors' in honor of the 50th anniversary of the group's self-titled album release on that date in 1967.

    "Sylvia Clevenger": "Sylvia Clevenger (born as Sylvia Mae Hughes; April 16, 1891 \u2013 January 7, 1951) was an American prostitute who worked with madam Pearl Elliott and was a minor associate of the John Dillinger gang. Her brother William was the former husband of Elliott. She was married three times, reverting to her maiden name of Hughes after her divorce from her second husband, John Clevenger, in 1930. She lived for much of her life in Kokomo, Indiana, and died in 1951 in Michigan City, Indiana.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nSylvia Mae Hughes was born on April 16, 1891 at Fairfield (now Oakford) in Howard County, Indiana. She was the daughter of Charley and Mary Hughes. According to the 1900 census, the family was living in Taylor Township, where her father's occupation was listed as a horse jockey.\n\n\n== Marriage ==\nHughes married Charles O. Alexander in Howard County on April 26, 1910. In the census of that year, the couple were recorded as living with her father in Taylor Township, Howard County, and two years later, they appear in the city directory of Kokomo. They were living at 323 1/2 North Buckeye, where Charles' occupation was listed as a waiter.The marriage was short-lived, as she was married for the second time on February 23, 1915, to John Clevenger in Howard County. Her location and the occupation of her husband can be traced from subsequent city directories for Kokomo and from census returns. In 1918, they were living at 1525 North McCann, and he was a teamster. Two years later, they were living at 715 West  Street in Kokomo, and had a son. John was by then a dealer in livestock. He was listed as a horse dealer in 1923, when they were living at 2437 North Main, and three years later were still living at the same location, but his occupation was a stock dealer. John's occupation had changed again by 1928, as he was listed as a driver in the city directory.By the time of the 1930 census, the couple were living at 2437 North Buckeye Street in Kokomo, where John's occupation was listed as a laborer, but the city directory for the same year listed Hughes as living on her own at 212 South Locke. On November 2, 1930 she was married for the third time, to Chester Williams in New Albany, Indiana. They were operating a used car business in 1934, and were based at 2437 North Main, where Hughes had lived in the 1920s with John Clevenger.\n\n\n== Local Notoriety ==\nHughes' husband, Clevenger, was well known to Kokomo police and had been convicted on liquor violations. On August 16, 1929, he brought a suit for divorce, charging that Sylvia refused to fix his meals, was constantly away from home and was 'in evil associations'. Three days later, a hearing on the case of assault and battery against John Clevenger filed by Hughes was postponed due to lack of witnesses from the city.  A continuance in the case was granted on August 24,  but the charges were eventually dismissed on December 5.On May 26, 1930, Clevenger found that Hughes was living in Terre Haute with Chester Williams. Clevenger and Frank Wallace, a parolee from Michigan City, beat Williams so severely that he was hospitalized for two weeks  Both men were charged with assault and battery with intent to kill.On September 16, 1930, Hughes hosted Pearl Elliott, Mrs. John Kiefer and Miss Bernice Rose, all of Kokomo, in Terre Haute. She was granted a divorce from Clevenger in September 1930 in Vigo County on grounds of cruel and inhumane treatment, and returned to using her maiden name of Hughes.\n\n\n== Association with Dillinger ==\nIn September 1933, bank robber John Dillinger gave $27,000 in cash to Pearl Elliott to buy and equip a hideout for his gang in Terre Haute, Indiana. Elliott enlisted the help of Clevenger, and the residence at 2351 Fernwood Avenue was purchased.Confessions of Ed Shouse, an associate of Dillinger, placed members of the gang in Terre Haute before the robberies of the Peru police station and the Central National Bank in Greencastle. When two suitcase-toting hitchhikers paid a Hendricks county farmer $25 to drop them off in Terre Haute at the corner of 25th and Fernwood, the police were contacted. On the morning of November 8, 1933, members of the Terre Haute Police, Indiana National Guard, and Indiana State Police raided the residence but did not find any of the gang there.\n\n\n== Post Dillinger ==\nOn March 5, 1935, Clevenger and Hughes filed suit in Howard County Circuit Court for possession of two lots and buildings against the estate of George Clevenger.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHughes died on January 7, 1951 in Michigan City, Indiana at the age of 59. She was buried in Crown Point Cemetery in Kokomo, Indiana.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==",

His body was found in the English Channel on 11 January 1924.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nA website using the name Mile High Club regards the \"Club's\" \"founder\" as pilot and design engineer Lawrence Sperry, along with \"socialite Mrs. Waldo Peirce\" (Dorothy Rice Sims)\n citing their flight in an autopilot-equipped Curtiss Flying Boat near New York in November 1916.\nWhy, Mrs Peirce and I didn't have what you might dignify by calling a real accident. It was only a trivial mishap. We decided to land on the water and came down perfectly from a height of 600 feet and would have made a perfect landing had not the hull of our machine struck one of the stakes that dot the water, which staved a hole in it.\nIn 1979, Sperry was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air & Space Museum.Sperry was inducted into the Naval Aviation Hall of Honor at the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, Florida, in 1992.\n\n\n== Sperry Award winners ==\n1938 Russell C.

    "Coronation Street Live": "Coronation Street is a British soap opera created by Granada Television and shown on ITV since 1960. The programme centres around Coronation Street: a cobbled, terraced street in Weatherfield, a fictional town based on inner-city Salford.Originally broadcast twice weekly, the series began airing six times a week in 2017. The programme was conceived by scriptwriter Tony Warren. Warren's initial proposal was rejected by the station's founder Sidney Bernstein, but he was persuaded by producer Harry Elton to produce the programme for 13 pilot episodes, and the show has since become a significant part of British culture.Coronation Street is made by ITV Granada at MediaCityUK and shown in all ITV regions, as well as internationally. In 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera. Initially influenced by the conventions of kitchen sink realism, Coronation Street is noted for its depiction of a down-to-earth, working-class community, combined with light-hearted humour and strong characters. The show currently averages around six million viewers per episode. The show premiered its 10,000th episode on 7 February 2020, and celebrated its 60th anniversary later that year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nThe first episode was aired on 9 December 1960 at 7 pm, and was not initially a critical success; Daily Mirror columnist Ken Irwin claimed the series would only last three weeks. Granada Television had commissioned only 13 episodes, and some inside the company doubted the show would last beyond its planned production run. Despite the criticism, viewers were immediately drawn into the serial, won over by Coronation Street's ordinary characters. The programme also made use of Northern English language and dialect; affectionate local terms like \"eh, chuck?\", \"nowt\" (, from nought, meaning nothing), and \"by 'eck!\" became widely heard on British television for the first time. Early episodes told the story of student Ken Barlow (William Roache), who had won a place at university, and thus found his working-class background\u2014as well as his younger brother, David (Alan Rothwell) and his parents, Frank (Frank Pemberton) and Ida (Noel Dyson)\u2014something of an embarrassment. The character was one of the few to have experienced much of life outside of Coronation Street. In some ways this predicts the growth of globalisation. In an episode from 1961, Barlow declares: \"You can't go on just thinking about your own street these days. We're living with people on the other side of the world. There's more to worry about than Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and her boyfriends.\" Roache is the only remaining member of the original cast, which makes him the longest-serving actor in Coronation Street, and in British and global soap history.In March 1961, Coronation Street reached number 1 in the television ratings and remained there for the rest of the year. Earlier in 1961, a Television Audience Measurement (TAM) showed that 75% of available viewers (15 million) tuned into Corrie, and by 1964 the programme had over 20 million regular viewers, with ratings peaking on 2 December 1964, at 21.36 million viewers. In spite of rising popularity with viewers, Coronation Street was criticised by some for its outdated portrayal of the urban working class, and its representation of a community that was a nostalgic fantasy. After the first episode in 1960, the Daily Mirror printed: \"The programme is doomed from the outset ... For there is little reality in this new serial, which apparently, we have to suffer twice a week.\" By 1967, critics were suggesting that the programme no longer reflected life in 1960s Britain, but reflected how life was in the 1950s. Granada hurried to update the programme, with the hope of introducing more issue-driven stories, including Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) becoming addicted to drugs, Jerry Booth (Graham Haberfield) being in a storyline about homosexuality, Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) having an out-of-wedlock child, and introducing a black family, but all of these ideas were dropped for fear of upsetting viewers.In 1964, Coronation Street appointed new producer, Tim Aspinall.  Aspinall decided on a new broom policy and 'The Bloody Purge' of 1964 began, with nine actors being sacked in total. The first cast member to be written out was Lynne Carol, who had played Martha Longhurst since episode two and the preview of the programme. Her sacking was so controversial that fellow actress Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) threatened to quit, but she was eventually persuaded not to.  The media reported extensively on the storyline, and when Lynne Carol took a private trip to the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition in London, she was mobbed by fans and asked to leave on the grounds of public safety. Many, including Coronation Street writer H.V. Kershaw, saw the killing of Martha as a desperate move to boost viewer ratings.\n\n\n=== 1970s ===\nThe show's production team was tested when many core cast members left the programme in the early 1970s. When Arthur Leslie died suddenly in 1970, his character, Rovers landlord Jack Walker, died off screen shortly afterwards. Anne Reid quit as Valerie Barlow; her character was killed off in 1971, electrocuting herself with a faulty hairdryer. Ratings reached a low of eight million in February 1973, when Pat Phoenix quit as Elsie Tanner and Doris Speed (Annie Walker) took two months' leave due to bereavement. The audience of ITV's other flagship soap opera Crossroads increased markedly at this time, as its established cast, such as Meg Richardson (Noele Gordon), grew in popularity. These sudden departures forced the writing team to quickly develop characters who had previously stood in the background. The roles of mostly younger characters including Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Deirdre Hunt (Anne Kirkbride), Rita Littlewood (Barbara Knox), Mavis Riley (Thelma Barlow) and Ivy Tildsley (Lynne Perrie) were built up between 1972 and 1973 (with Perrie's character being renamed to the better-known \"Tilsley\"), and characters such as Gail Potter (Helen Worth), Blanche Hunt (Patricia Cutts/Maggie Jones), and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) first appearing in 1974. These characters would remain at the centre of the programme for many years, with Gail still being in the show nearly half a century after her first appearance. Comic storylines had been popular in the series in the 1960s but had become sparse during the early 1970s. These were re-introduced by new producer Bill Podmore who joined the series in 1976. He had worked on Granada comedy productions prior to his appointment.In September 1977, the News of the World quoted actor Stephen Hancock (Ernest Bishop) as saying  'The Street kills an actor. I'm just doing a job, not acting. The scriptwriters have turned me into Ernie Bishop. I've tried to resist it but it is very hard not to play the part all the time, even at home.'  This was the first sight the public had of a bitter argument between Hancock and Granada Television. Hancock objected to the cast payment system and threatened to quit the show to safeguard his principles. The main dispute was between Hancock and Podmore, with Podmore being nicknamed 'The Godfather' by the British media. The basis of Hancock's argument was that different actors were guaranteed different numbers of episode appearances per year, thus some were paid more than others.  Actors from the earliest days of the programme, including Pat Phoenix, Doris Speed and Peter Adamson, were guaranteed payment for every one of the year's episodes, regardless of whether or not they actually appeared. Podmore was not willing to change what he called a 'complex and well-established system', leading Hancock to stand by his principles and resign. The problem now shifted, and writers had to write Ernie out but save his wife Emily (Eileen Derbyshire). The decision was made for Ernest to be killed off in a bungled robbery at Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) factory, where he worked in payroll. Ernest was killed by a single gunshot to the stomach on 11 January 1978.  It was the first time that violence on such a scale had been shown on Coronation Street and after the episode was aired, Granada's switchboard was jammed by angry viewers. Letters of complaint arrived in their hundreds, and the Lobby Against TV Violence fiercely objected Granada's decision to broadcast the episode.  Granada stated that the storyline was not about violence, but that it aimed to show the desolation and loss felt by Ernest's widow, Emily. Coronation Street had little competition within its prime-time slot, and certain critics suggested that the programme had grown complacent, moving away from socially viable storylines, and again presenting a dated view of working-class life.\n\n\n=== 1980s ===\nPeter Adamson, who had played Len Fairclough since 1961, was sacked in 1983 for breach of contract. He had been warned by Granada Television for writing unauthorised newspaper articles criticising the show and cast. Coronation Street producer Podmore sacked Adamson when it was revealed he had sold his memoirs after the previous warning. The sacking coincided with allegations of Adamson having indecently assaulted two young girls. In April 1983, a newspaper reported that Adamson had been arrested for indecently assaulting two eight-year-old girls at a swimming pool. The police complaint was that Adamson's hands had strayed while giving the girls swimming lessons. Granada Television gave Adamson financial support through his legal problems, with a Crown Court jury finding him not guilty in July 1983. Adamson's dispute over his memoirs and newspaper articles was not known to the public and the media reported that Adamson had been dismissed because of the shame indecent assault allegations had brought onto Granada and the Coronation Street brand. Len Fairclough was killed off-screen in a motorway crash on 7 December 1983. To demonise the character, it was revealed that he had been returning home from an affair, cheating on his wife Rita (Barbara Knox). Adamson celebrated the character's death by delivering an obituary on TV-am dressed as an undertaker.During 1988, actor Christopher Quinten, who had played Brian Tilsley since 27 December 1978, told bosses at Granada that he was going to move to the United States to marry his then-fianc\u00e9e, American talk show host Leeza Gibbons and to build an acting career in Los Angeles. In announcing his resignation, Quinten tried to ensure that his role would be left open for him to return in the event that his stint in America failed. At the time, his character was married to Gail and the story conference called to write Brian out struggled to find a justifiable way to write him out while still leaving enough scope for a possible return. The decision was made that Brian should die. Quinten was in Los Angeles when the storyline was decided, and upon his return to the United Kingdom, he was shocked at Brian's fate and threatened to fly back to America so that scenes could not be filmed.  He was talked round by co-star Helen Worth, who pointed out that he might be blacklisted by Equity if he quit the programme abruptly. Brian Tilsley's death was broadcast on 15 February 1989. After the breakdown of his marriage to Gail, Brian started spending his evenings going to discos and meeting up with various women. He tried to protect a young lady from a group of thugs outside a nightclub, but was stabbed in the stomach. He died as a result of his injuries. The stabbing brought massive complaints from viewers and Mary Whitehouse delivered an angry sermon about television violence.Between 1980 and 1989, Coronation Street underwent some of the most radical changes since its launch. By May 1984, William Roache stood as the only original cast member, after the departures of Violet Carson (Ena Sharples) in 1980, Doris Speed (Annie Walker) in 1983, and both Pat Phoenix (Elsie Tanner) and Jack Howarth (Albert Tatlock) in 1984. Albert Tatlock's departure came when his character's off screen death was announced several months after the death of actor Jack Howarth at the age of 88.  While the press predicted the end of Corrie, H. V. Kershaw declared that \"There are no stars in Coronation Street. The show had also gained a new rival on Channel 4 with the launch of Brookside, and BBC was preparing to launch EastEnders, which would first air in February 1985. \" Writers drew on the show's many archetypes, with established characters stepping into the roles left by the original cast. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers) was hailed as the new Ena Sharples in 1982, the Duckworths moved into No.9 in 1983 and slipped into the role once held by the Ogdens, while Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) appeared in 1983 and took over the grumpy war veteran role from Albert Tatlock. The question of who would take over the Rovers Return after Annie Walker's 1983 exit was answered in 1985 when Bet Lynch (who also mirrored the vulnerability and strength of Elsie Tanner) was installed as landlady. In 1983, Shirley Armitage (Lisa Lewis) became the first major black character in her role as machinist at Baldwin's Casuals.Ken Barlow married Deirdre Langton (Anne Kirkbride) on 27 July 1981. The episode was watched by over 15 million viewers \u2013 more ITV viewers than the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana two days later. In the 1980s relationships were cemented between established characters: Alf Roberts (Bryan Mosley) married Audrey Potter (Sue Nicholls) in 1985; Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) married Sally Seddon (Sally Whittaker) in 1986; Bet Lynch married Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough) in 1987; and 1988 saw the marriages of widowed Ivy Tilsley to Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), and the long-awaited union of Mavis Riley and Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), after over a decade of on-off romances and a failed marriage attempt in 1984.In 1982, the arrival of Channel 4, and its edgy new soap opera Brookside, sparked one of the biggest changes for Coronation Street. Unlike Coronation Street, which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, Brookside brought together working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in Coronation Street were largely about family affairs, Brookside concentrated on social affairs such as industrial action, unemployment, drugs, rape, and the black market. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, EastEnders in 1985. Like Brookside, EastEnders had a more gritty premise than Coronation Street, although unlike Brookside it tended to steer clear of blue language and politicised stories. Both of these shows were quickly well-received by the media and viewing public, although they were not without their controversies and critics.\nWhile ratings for Coronation Street remained consistent throughout the decade, EastEnders regularly obtained higher viewing figures due to its omnibus episodes shown at weekends. The Coronation Street episode broadcast on 2 January 1985 attracted 21.40 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode in the show's history based on a single showing. Subsequent episodes would achieve higher figures when the original broadcast and omnibus edition figures were combined. With prime time competition, Corrie was again seen as being old fashioned, with the introduction of the 'normal' Clayton family in 1985 being a failure with viewers, being written out the following year. Between 1988 and 1989, many aspects of the show were modernised by new producer David Liddiment. A new exterior set had been built in 1982, and in 1989 it was redeveloped to include new houses and shops. Production techniques were also changed with a new studio being built, and the inclusion of more location filming, which had moved the show from being shot on film to videotape in 1988. Due to new pressures, an introduction of the third weekly episode aired on 20 October 1989, to broadcast each Friday at 7:30 pm.The 1980s featured some of the most prominent storylines in the programme's history, such as Deirdre Barlow's affair with Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) in 1983, the first soap storyline to receive widespread media attention. The feud between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin would continue for many years, with Mike even marrying Ken's daughter, Susan (Wendy Jane Walker). In 1986, there was a fire at the Rovers Return. The episode that aired on Christmas Day 1987, attracted a combined audience (original and omnibus) of 26.65 million \u2013 a figure helped by the fact that this episode heralded the departure of immensely-popular character Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander). Between 1986 and 1989, the story of Rita Fairclough's (Barbara Knox) psychological abuse at the hands of Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), and then his subsequent death under the wheels of a Blackpool tram in December 1989, was played out. This storyline gave the show its highest combined viewing figure in its history with 26.93 million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Alan is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode. This rating is sometimes incorrectly credited to the 8 December 1989 tram death episode. Other stories included the birth of Nicky Tilsley (Warren Jackson) in 1980, Elsie Tanner's departure and Stan Ogden's funeral in 1984, the birth of Sarah-Louise Tilsley (Lynsay King) in 1987, and Brian Tilsley's murder in 1989.\nThe 1980s saw further new and mostly younger characters being introduced, including until Terry Duckworth (Nigel Pivaro), Curly Watts (Kevin Kennedy), Martin Platt (Sean Wilson), Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley), and the McDonald family; one of whom, Simon Gregson, started on the show as Steve McDonald a week after his 15th birthday, and has been on the show ever since. His parents Jim (Charles Lawson) and Liz (Beverley Callard) have made several departures and comebacks since debuting in 1989.\n\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn spite of updated sets and production changes, Coronation Street still received criticism. In 1992, chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, Lord Rees-Mogg, criticised the low representation of ethnic minorities, and the programme's portrayal of the cosy familiarity of a bygone era, particularly as many comparable neighbours in the real life Greater Manchester area had a significant percentage of black and Asian residents. Some newspapers ran headlines such as \"Coronation Street shuts out blacks\" (The Times), and \"'Put colour in t'Street\" (Daily Mirror). Patrick Stoddart of The Times wrote: \"The millions who watch Coronation Street \u2013 and who will continue to do so despite Lord Rees-Mogg \u2013 know real life when they see it ... in the most confident and accomplished soap opera television has ever seen\". Black and Asian characters had appeared from time to time over the years, but it was not until 1999 that the show featured its first regular non-white family, the Desai family.\nNew characters Des (Philip Middlemiss) and Steph Barnes (Amelia Bullmore) moved into one of the new houses in 1990, being dubbed by the media as Yuppies. Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) first appeared at the beginning of 1991 and went on to become one of the most popular characters of the era until her departure in 1996, followed by a brief comeback three years later. The McDonald family were developed and the fiery relationships between Liz (Beverly Callard), Jim (Charles Lawson), Steve (Simon Gregson) and Andy (Nicholas Cochrane) interested viewers. Other newcomers were wheelchair user and pensioner Maud Grimes (Elizabeth Bradley), middle-aged cafe owner Roy Cropper (David Neilson), young married couple Gary and Judy Mallett (Ian Mercer and Gaynor Faye), as well as middle-aged butcher Fred Elliott (John Savident) and his son Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold). The amount of slapstick and physical humour in storylines increased during the 1990s, with comical characters such as supermarket manager Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley) and his water bed.In the early 1990s storylines included the death of newborn Katie McDonald in January 1992, Mike Baldwin's (Johnny Briggs) wedding to Alma Sedgewick (Amanda Barrie) later that year, Tommy Duckworth being sold by his father Terry (Nigel Pivaro) in 1993, Deirdre Barlow's (Anne Kirkbride) marriage to Moroccan Samir Rachid (Al Nedjari), and the rise of Tanya Pooley (Eva Pope) between 1993 and 1994.\nIn 1995, Julie Goodyear (Bet Lynch) left the show, 29 years after her first appearance and 25 years after becoming a regular cast member. She made brief re-appearances in 2002 and 2003.\nIn 1997, Brian Park took over as producer, with the idea of promoting young characters as opposed to the older cast. On his first day, he cut the characters of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington), Bill Webster (Peter Armitage), Billy Williams (Frank Mills) and Maureen Holdsworth (Sherrie Hewson). Thelma Barlow, who played Derek's wife Mavis, was angered by the firing of her co-star and resigned. The production team lost some of its key writers when Barry Hill, Adele Rose and Julian Roach all resigned as well.In line with Park's suggestion, younger characters were introduced during 1997 and 1998. A teenage Nick Tilsley was recast, played by Adam Rickitt following the departure of original actor Warren Jackson, single mother Zoe Tattersall (Joanne Froggatt) first appeared, and the problem Battersby family moved into No.5. Storylines focussed on tackling 'issues', such as drug dealers, eco-warriors, religious cults, and a transsexual woman. Park quit in 1998, after deciding that he had done what he intended to do; he maintained that his biggest achievement was the introduction of Hayley Patterson (Julie Hesmondhalgh), the first transsexual character in a British soap. The character married Roy Cropper soon after her arrival.Some viewers were alienated by the new Coronation Street, and sections of the media voiced their disapproval. Having received criticism of being too out of touch, Corrie now struggled to emulate the more modern Brookside and EastEnders. In the Daily Mirror, Victor Lewis-Smith wrote: \"Apparently it doesn't matter that this is a first-class soap opera, superbly scripted and flawlessly performed by a seasoned repertory company.\"One of Coronation Street's best known storylines took place in March/April 1998, with Deirdre Rachid (Anne Kirkbride) being wrongfully imprisoned after a relationship with con-man Jon Lindsay (Owen Aaronovitch). The episode in which Deirdre was sent to prison had an audience of 19 million viewers, and 'Free the Weatherfield One' campaigns sprung up in a media frenzy. Then Prime Minister Tony Blair even passed comment on Deirdre's sentencing in Parliament. Deirdre was freed after three weeks, with Granada stating that they had always intended for her to be released, in spite of the media interest.\n\n\n=== 2000s ===\nOn 8 December 2000, the show celebrated its 40th anniversary by broadcasting a live, hour-long episode. The Prince of Wales appeared as himself in an ITV News bulletin report. Earlier in the year, 13-year-old Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) had become pregnant and given birth to a baby girl, Bethany, on 4 June. The February episode where Gail was told of her daughter's pregnancy was watched by 15 million viewers. From 1999 to 2001, issue-led storylines were introduced such as Toyah Battersby's (Georgia Taylor) rape, Roy and Hayley Cropper (David Neilson and Julie Hesmondhalgh) abducting their foster child, Sarah Platt's Internet chat room abduction and Alma Halliwell's (Amanda Barrie) death from cervical cancer. Such storylines were unpopular with viewers and ratings dropped and in October 2001, Macnaught was abruptly moved to another Granada department and Carolyn Reynolds took over. In 2002, Kieran Roberts was appointed as producer and aimed to re-introduce \"gentle storylines and humour\", after deciding that the Street should not try to compete with other soaps.In July 2002, Gail married Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), a recently-introduced financial advisor who had already left Duggie Ferguson (John Bowe) to die after he fell down a set of ladders during an argument, and murdered his ex-wife Patricia (Annabelle Apsion), before going on to kill neighbour Maxine Peacock (Tracy Shaw); and attempt to kill both his mother-in-law Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and her longtime friend, Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire), for financial gain due to his mounting debts. After confessing his crimes to Gail in a two-episode handler in February 2003, Hillman left the street for two weeks before returning with the intent of killing himself as well as Gail, her children Sarah and David (Jack P. Shepherd), and grand-daughter Bethany, before driving them into a canal \u2013 though the Platt family survived whilst Richard drowned. This came just months after Sarah had survived serious injuries after being passenger in a stolen car which crashed. The storyline received wide press attention, and viewing figures peaked at 19.4 million, with Hillman dubbed a \"serial killer\" by the media. Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) became Corrie's first regular homosexual character. In 2003, another gay male character was introduced, Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). The bigamy of Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and his addiction to alcohol, later in the decade, Maya Sharma's (Sasha Behar) revenge on former lover Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin), Charlie Stubbs's (Bill Ward) psychological abuse of Shelley Unwin (Sally Lindsay), and the deaths of Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn) and Fred Elliott (John Savident). In 2007, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) murdered Charlie Stubbs and claiming it was self-defence; the audience during this storyline peaked at 13.3 million. At the 2007 British Soap Awards, it won Best Storyline, and Ford was voted Best Actress for her portrayal. Other storylines included Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) becoming a prostitute and the show's first bisexual love triangle (between Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh), Sonny Dhillon (Pal Aron), and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton)).\nIn July 2007, after 34 years in the role of Vera Duckworth, Liz Dawn left the show due to ill health. After conversation between Dawn and producers Kieran Roberts and Steve Frost, the decision was made to kill Vera off. In January 2008, shortly before plans to retire to Blackpool, Vera's husband Jack (William Tarmey) found that she had died in her armchair.\nTina O'Brien revealed in the British press on 4 April 2007 that she would be leaving Coronation Street later in the year. Sarah-Louise, who was involved in some of the decade's most controversial stories, left in December 2007 with her daughter, Bethany. In 2008, Michelle learning that Ryan (Ben Thompson) was not her biological son, having been accidentally swapped at birth with Alex Neeson (Dario Coates). Carla Connor (Alison King) turned to Liam for comfort and developed feelings for him. In spite of knowing about her feelings, Liam married Maria Sutherland (Samia Longchambon). Maria and Liam's baby son was stillborn in April, and during an estrangement from Maria upon the death of their baby, Liam had a one-night stand with Carla, a story which helped pave the way for his departure. Gail Platt's (Helen Worth) son David (Jack P. Shepherd) pushed her down the stairs. Enraged that Gail refused to press charges, David vandalised the Street and was sent to a young offenders' facility for several months. In May 2008, Gail finally met Ted Page (Michael Byrne), the father she had never known and in 2009, Gail's boyfriend Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) became addicted to painkillers, which came to a head when he broke into the medical centre. \nIn August 2008, Jed Stone (Kenneth Cope) returned after 42 years. Liam Connor and his ex-sister-in-law Carla gave into their feelings for each other and began an affair. Carla's fianc\u00e9e Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) discovered the affair and had Liam killed in a hit-and-run in October. Carla struggled to come to terms with Liam's death, but decided she still loved Tony and married him on 3 December, in an episode attracting 10.3 million viewers. In April 2009 it was revealed that Eileen Grimshaw's (Sue Cleaver) father, Colin (Edward de Souza) \u2013 the son of Elsie Tanner's (Pat Phoenix) cousin Arnley \u2013 had slept with Eileen's old classmate, Paula Carp (Sharon Duce) while she was still at school, and that Paula's daughter Julie (Katy Cavanagh) was in fact also Colin's daughter. Other stories in 2009 included Maria giving birth to Liam's son and her subsequent relationship with Liam's killer Tony, Steve McDonald's (Simon Gregson) marriage to Becky Granger (Katherine Kelly) and Kevin Webster's (Michael Le Vell) affair with Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns). On Christmas Day 2009, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) told husband Kevin that she had breast cancer, just as he was about to leave her for lover Molly.\n\n\n=== 2010s ===\nThe show began broadcasting in high-definition in May 2010, and on 17 September that year, Coronation Street entered Guinness World Records as the world's longest-running television soap opera after the American soap opera As the World Turns concluded. William Roache was listed as the world's longest-running soap actor. Coronation Street's 50th anniversary week was celebrated with seven episodes, plus a special one-hour live episode, broadcast from 6\u201310 December. The episodes averaged 14 million viewers, a 52.1% share of the audience. The anniversary was also publicised with ITV specials and news broadcasts. In the storyline, Nick Tilsley and Leanne Battersby's bar \u2014 The Joinery \u2014 exploded during Peter Barlow's stag party. As a result, the viaduct was destroyed, sending a Metrolink tram careering onto the street, destroying D&S Alahan's Corner Shop and The Kabin. Two characters, Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns), along with an unknown taxi driver, were killed as a result of the disaster. Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) survived, despite being trapped under the rubble of her destroyed shop. Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) prematurely gave birth to a baby girl, Hope. The episode of EastEnders broadcast on the same day as Coronation Street's 50th anniversary episode included a tribute, with the character Dot Branning (June Brown, who briefly appeared in the show during the 1970s) saying that she never misses an episode of Coronation Street.\n\n\n=== 2020s ===\nOn Friday 7 February 2020, with its 60th anniversary less than a year away, Coronation Street aired its landmark 10,000th episode, the runtime of which was extended to 60 minutes. Producers stated that the episode would contain \"a nostalgic trip down memory lane\" and \"a nod to its own past\". A month later, ITV announced that production on the soap would have to be suspended, as the United Kingdom was put into a national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television).After an 11-week intermission for all cast and crew members, filming resumed in June 2020. The episodes would feature social distancing to adhere to the guidelines set by the British government, and it was confirmed that all actors over 70, as well as those with underlying health conditions, would not be allowed to be on set until it was safe to do so. This included Coronation Street veterans William Roache (Ken Barlow) at 88, Barbara Knox (Rita Tanner) at 87, Malcolm Hebden (Norris Cole) at 80 and Sue Nichols (Audrey Roberts) at 76. Maureen Lipman (Evelyn Plummer) and David Neilson (Roy Cropper) returned to set slightly earlier due to being 73 and 71 respectively, as it was deemed safe to do so. By December all cast members had returned to set and on Wednesday 9 December 2020, the soap celebrated its 60th anniversary, with original plans for the episode forced to change due to COVID-19 guidelines. The anniversary week saw the conclusion of a long-running coercive control storyline that began in May 2019, with Geoff Metcalfe (Ian Bartholomew) abusing Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King). The showdown, which resulted in the death of Geoff allowed social distancing rules to be relaxed on the condition that the crew members involved formed a social bubble prior to the filming. In late 2021 series producer Iain MacLeod announced that the original plans for the 60th Anniversary would now take place in a special week of episodes in October 2021.On 12 October 2021, it was announced that Coronation Street would partake in a special crossover event involving multiple British soaps to promote the topic of climate change ahead of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. During the week, beginning from 1 November, social media clips featuring Liam Cavanagh and Amelia Spencer from Emmerdale, as well as Daniel Granger from Doctors  were featured on the programme, while events from Holby City were also referenced. A similar clip featuring Maria Connor was also featured on EastEnders.On 24 January 2022, ITV announced that as part of an overhaul of their evening programming, Coronation Street will permanently air as three 60-minute episodes per week from March 2022 onwards.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\nSince 1960, Coronation Street has featured many characters whose popularity with viewers and critics has differed greatly. The original cast was created by Tony Warren, with the characters of Ena Sharples (Violet Carson), Elsie Tanner (Pat Phoenix) and Annie Walker (Doris Speed) as central figures. These three women remained with the show for at least 20 years, and became archetypes of British soap opera, often being emulated by other serials. Ena was the street's busybody, battle-axe and self-proclaimed moral voice. Elsie was the tart with a heart, who was constantly hurt by men in the search for true love. Annie Walker, landlady of the Rovers Return Inn, had delusions of grandeur and saw herself as better than the other residents.Coronation Street became known for the portrayal of strong female characters, including original cast characters like Ena, Annie and Elsie, and later Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander), who first appeared in 1964; all four became household names during the 1960s. Warren's programme was largely matriarchal, which some commentators put down to the female-dominant environment in which he grew up. Consequently, the show has a long tradition of psychologically-abused husbands, most famously Stan Ogden (Bernard Youens) and Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey), husbands of Hilda and Vera Duckworth (Liz Dawn), respectively.\nCoronation Street's longest-serving character, Ken Barlow (William Roache) entered the storyline as a young radical, reflecting the youth of 1960s Britain, where figures like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the model Twiggy were to reshape the concept of youthful rebellion. Though the rest of the original Barlow family were killed off before the end of the 1970s, Ken, who for 27 years was the only character from the first episode remaining, has remained the constant link throughout the entire series. In 2011, Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), another character from the first episode, returned to Coronation Street after a 43-year absence. Since 1984, Ken Barlow has been the show's only remaining original character. Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) had appeared in the series since January 1961, when the show was just weeks old, and was the show's longest-serving female character before she departed in January 2016 after 55 years. Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox) appeared on the show for one episode in December 1964, before returning as a full-time cast member in January 1972. She is currently the second longest-serving original cast member on the show. Roache and Knox are also the two oldest-working cast members on the soap at 89 and 88 years-old respectively.\nStan and Hilda Ogden were introduced in 1964, with Hilda becoming one of the most famous British soap opera characters of all time. In a 1982 poll, she was voted fourth-most recognisable woman in Britain, after Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales. Hilda's best-known attributes were her pinny, hair curlers, and the \"muriel\" in her living room with three \"flying\" duck ornaments. Hilda Ogden's departure on Christmas Day 1987, remains the highest-rated episode of Coronation Street ever, with nearly 27,000,000 viewers. Stan Ogden had been killed off in 1984 following the death of actor Bernard Youens after a long illness which had restricted his appearances towards the end.Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) first appeared in 1966, before becoming a regular in 1970, and went on to become one of the most famous Corrie characters. Bet stood as the central character of the show from 1985 until departing in 1995, often being dubbed as \"Queen of the Street\" by the media, and indeed herself. The character briefly returned in June 2002.Coronation Street and its characters often rely heavily on archetypes, with the characterisation of some of its current and recent cast based loosely on former characters. Phyllis Pearce (Jill Summers), Blanche Hunt (Maggie Jones) and Sylvia Goodwin (Stephanie Cole) embodied the role of the acid-tongued busybody originally held by Ena, Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor) has grown snobbish, like Annie, and a number of the programme's female characters, such as Carla Connor (Alison King), mirror the vulnerability of Elsie and Bet. Other recurring archetypes include the war veteran such as Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth), Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington) and Gary Windass (Mikey North), the bumbling retail manager like Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), Reg Holdsworth (Ken Morley), Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden), quick-tempered, tough tradesmen like Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson), Tommy Harris (Thomas Craig) and Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), and the perennial losers such as Stan and Hilda, Jack and Vera, Les Battersby (Bruce Jones), Beth Tinker (Lisa George) and Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment).Villains are also common character types, such as Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Alan Bradley (Mark Eden), Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews), Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien), Caz Hammond (Rhea Bailey), Richard Hillman (Brian Capron), Greg Kelly (Stephen Billington), Will Chatterton (Leon Ockenden), Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper), Callum Logan (Sean Ward), Karl Munro (John Michie), Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre), David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar), Kirsty Soames (Natalie Gumede), John Stape (Graeme Hawley), Geoff Metcalfe (Ian Bartholomew) and Gary Windass (Mikey North). The show's former archivist and scriptwriter Daran Little disagreed with the characterisation of the show as a collection of stereotypes. \"Rather, remember that Elsie, Ena and others were the first of their kind ever seen on British television. If later characters are stereotypes, it's because they are from the same original mould. It is the hundreds of programmes that have followed which have copied Coronation Street.\"\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Broadcast format ===\n\nBetween 9 December 1960 and 3 March 1961, Coronation Street was broadcast twice weekly, on Wednesday and Friday. During this period, the Friday episode was broadcast live, with the Wednesday episode being pre-recorded 15 minutes later. When the programme went fully networked on 6 March 1961, broadcast days changed to Monday and Wednesday. The last regular episode to be shown live was broadcast on 3 February 1961.\nThe series was transmitted in black and white for the majority of the 1960s. Preparations were made to film episode 923, to be transmitted Wednesday 29 October 1969, in colour. This installment featured the street's residents on a coach trip to the Lake District. In the end, suitable colour film stock for the cameras could not be found and the footage was shot in black and white. The following episode, transmitted Monday 3 November, was videotaped in colour but featured black and white film inserts and title sequence. Like BBC1, the ITV network was officially broadcast in black and white at this point (though programmes were actually broadcast in colour as early as July that year for colour transmission testing and adjustment) so the episode was seen by most in black and white.\nThe ITV network, like BBC1, began full colour transmissions on 15 November 1969. Daran Little, for many years the official programme archivist, claims that the first episode to be transmitted in colour was episode 930 shown on 24 November 1969.\nIn October 1970 a technicians' dispute turned into a work-to-rule when sound staff were denied a pay rise given to camera staff the year before for working with colour recording equipment. The terms of the work-to-rule were that staff refused to work with the new equipment (though the old black and white equipment had been disposed of by then) and therefore programmes were recorded and transmitted in black and white, including Coronation Street The dispute was resolved in early 1971 and the last black and white episode was broadcast on 10 February 1971, although the episodes transmitted on 22 and 24 February 1971 had contained black and white location inserts.\nEpisode 5191, originally broadcast on 7 January 2002, was the first to be broadcast in 16:9 widescreen format. Coronation Street was the last UK-wide soap to make the switch to 16:9 (Take the High Road remained in 4:3 until it finished in 2003).\nFrom 22 March 2010, Coronation Street was produced in 1080/50i for transmission on HDTV platforms on ITV HD. The first transmission in this format was episode 7351 on 31 May 2010 with a new set of titles and re-recorded theme tune. On 26 May 2010 ITV previewed the new HD titles on the Coronation Street website. Due to copyright reasons only viewers residing in the UK could see them on the ITV site.\n\n\n=== Production staff ===\n\nCoronation Street's creator, Tony Warren, wrote the first 13 episodes of the programme in 1960, and continued to write for the programme intermittently until 1976. He later became a novelist, but retained links with Coronation Street. Warren died in 2016.Harry Kershaw was the script editor for Coronation Street when the programme began in 1960, working alongside Tony Warren. Kershaw was also a script writer for the programme and the show's producer between 1962 and 1971. He remains the only person, along with John Finch, to have held the three posts of script editor, writer and producer.\nAdele Rose was Coronation Street's first female writer and the show's longest-serving writer, completing 455 scripts between 1961 and 1998. She also created Byker Grove. Rose also won a BAFTA award in 1993 for her work on the show.Bill Podmore was the show's longest serving producer. By the time he stepped down in 1988 he had completed 13 years at the production helm. Nicknamed the \"godfather\" by the tabloid press, he was renowned for his tough, uncompromising style and was feared by both crew and cast alike. He is known for sacking Peter Adamson, the show's Len Fairclough, in 1983. Iain MacLeod is the current series producer.Michael Apted, best known for the Up! series of documentaries was a director on the programme in the early 1960s. This period of his career marked the first of his many collaborations with writer Jack Rosenthal. Rosenthal, noted for such television plays as Bar Mitzvah Boy, began his career on the show, writing over 150 episodes between 1961 and 1969. Paul Abbott was a story editor on the programme in the 1980s and began writing episodes in 1989, but left in 1993 to produce Cracker, for which he later wrote, before creating his own dramas such as Touching Evil and Shameless. Russell T Davies was briefly a storyliner on the programme in the mid-1990s, also writing the script for the direct-to-video special \"Viva Las Vegas!\" He, too, has become a noted writer of his own high-profile television drama programmes, including Queer as Folk and the 2005 revival of Doctor Who. Jimmy McGovern also wrote some episodes.\n\n\n=== Theme music ===\nThe show's theme music, a cornet piece, accompanied by a brass band plus clarinet and double bass, reminiscent of northern band music, was written by Eric Spear.The original theme tune was called Lancashire Blues and Spear was paid a \u00a36 commission in 1960 to write it.The identity of the trumpeter was not public knowledge until 1994, when jazz musician and journalist Ron Simmonds revealed that it was the Surrey musician Ronnie Hunt. He added, \"an attempt was made in later years to re-record that solo, using Stan Roderick, but it sounded too good, and they reverted to the old one.\" In 2004, the Manchester Evening News published a contradictory story that a young musician from Wilmslow called David Browning played the trumpet on both the original recording of the theme in 1960 and a re-recording in 1964, for a one-off payment of \u00a336.A new, completely re-recorded version of the theme tune replaced the original when the series started broadcasting in HD on 31 May 2010. It accompanied a new montage-style credits sequence featuring images of Manchester and Weatherfield.A reggae version of the theme tune was recorded by The I-Royals and released by Media Marvels and WEA in 1983.On 31 March 2017, it was revealed on the YouTube channel of Corrie that some of the soap's cast would sing a specially written lyric, of which will be added to the new theme song that will be played, as of the first episode of the evening of Monday, 3 April 2017, but it turned out to be an April Fool's joke.\n\n\n=== Viewing figures ===\nEpisodes in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, regularly attracted figures of between 18 and 21 million viewers, and during the 1990s and early 2000s, 14 to 16 million per episode would be typical. Like most terrestrial television in the UK, a decline in viewership has taken place and the show posts an average audience of just under 9 million per episode as of 2013, remaining one of the highest rated programmes in the UK. EastEnders and Coronation Street have often competed for the highest rated show.The episode that aired on 2 January 1985, where Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear) finds out she has got the job as manager of the Rovers Return, is the highest-rated single episode in the show's history, attracting 21.40 million viewers. 25 December 1987 episode, where Hilda Ogden (Jean Alexander) leaves the street to start a new life as a housekeeper for long-term employer Dr Lowther, attracted a combined audience of 26.65 million for its original airing and omnibus repeat on 27 December 1987. This is the second-highest combined rating in the show's history. The show attracted its highest-ever combined rating of 26.93 million for the episode that aired on 15 (and 19) March 1989, where Rita Fairclough (Barbara Knox) is in hospital and Alan Bradley (Mark Eden) is hiding from the police after trying to kill Rita in the previous episode.\n\n\n=== Sets ===\n\nThe regular exterior buildings shown in Coronation Street include a row of terrace houses, several townhouses, and communal areas including a newsagents (The Kabin), a caf\u00e9 (Roy's Rolls), a general grocery shop (D&S Alahan's), a factory (Underworld) and Rovers Return Inn public house. The Rovers Return Inn is the main meeting place for the show's characters.Between 1960 and 1968, street scenes were filmed before a set constructed in a studio, with the house fronts reduced in scale to 3/4 and constructed from wood. In 1968 Granada built an outside set not all that different from the interior version previously used, with the wooden fa\u00e7ades from the studio simply being erected on the new site. When the show began broadcasting in color, these were replaced with brick fa\u00e7ades, and back yards were added in the 1970s.In 1982, a permanent full-street set was built in the Granada backlot, an area between Quay Street and Liverpool Road in Manchester. The set was constructed from reclaimed Salford brick. The set was updated in 1989 with the construction of a new factory, two shop units and three modern town houses on the south side of the street.Between 1989 and 1999, the Granada Studios Tour allowed members of the public to visit the set. The exterior set was extended and updated in 1999. This update added to the Rosamund Street and Victoria Street fa\u00e7ades, and added a viaduct on Rosamund Street. Most interior scenes are shot in the adjoining purpose-built studio.In 2008, Victoria Court, an apartment building full of luxury flats, was started on Victoria Street.In 2014, production moved to a new site at Trafford Wharf, a former dock area about two miles to the east, part of the MediaCityUK complex. The Trafford Wharf backlot is built upon a former truck stop site next to the Imperial War Museum North. It took two years from start to finish to recreate the iconic Street. The houses were built to almost full scale after previously being three-quarter size.\nOn 5 April 2014, the staff began to allow booked public visits to the old Quay Street set. An advert, with a voiceover from Victoria Wood, appeared on TV to advertise the tour. The tour was discontinued in December 2015.\nOn 12 March 2018, the extension of the  Victoria Street set was officially unveiled. The new set features a garden, featuring a memorial bench paying tribute to the 22 victims of the Manchester Arena bombing, including Coronation Street super fan Martyn Hett. The precinct includes a Greater Manchester Police station called Weatherfield Police station. As part of a product placement deal between three companies and ITV Studios, new additions include a Tram stop station which is named Weatherfield North with Transport for Greater Manchester Metrolink branding, and shop front facades of Costa Coffee and the Weatherfield branded Co-op Food store interior scenes have been screened and exterior scenes at the new set first aired on 20 April 2018.\nOn 20 April 2018, ITV announced that they had been granted official approval of planning permission to allow booked public visits to the MediaCityUK Trafford Wharf set. Tours commenced on weekends from 26 May 2018 onwards.\n\n\n== Broadcast ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nFor 60 years, Coronation Street has remained at the centre of ITV's prime time schedule. The programme is usually shown in the UK in six episodes, over three evenings a week on ITV. Additional episodes have been broadcast at other times, such as between 22 and 26 November 2004, when eight episodes were shown. Occasional late night episodes of Coronation Street begin at 10 pm, due to the watershed.\nFrom Friday 9 December 1960 until Friday 3 March 1961, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Wednesday and Friday at 7 pm. Schedules were changed and from Monday 6 March 1961 until Wednesday 11 October 1989, the programme was shown in two episodes broadcast Monday and Wednesday at 7:30 pm. A third weekly episode was introduced on Friday 20 October 1989, broadcast at 7:30 pm. From 1996, an extra episode was broadcast at 7:30 pm on Sunday nights.\nAside from Granada, the programme originally appeared on the following stations of the ITV network: Anglia Television, Associated-Rediffusion, Television Wales and the West, Scottish Television, Southern Television and Ulster Television. From episode 14 on Wednesday 25 January 1961, Tyne Tees Television broadcast the programme. That left ATV in the Midlands as the only ITV station not carrying the show. When they decided to broadcast the programme, national transmission was changed from Wednesday and Friday at 7 pm to Monday and Wednesday at 7:30 pm and the programme became fully networked under this new arrangement from episode 25 on Monday 6 March 1961.\nAs the ITV network grew over the next few years, the programme was transmitted by these new stations on these dates onward: Westward Television from episode 40 on 1 May 1961, Border Television from episode 76 on 4 September 1961, Grampian Television from episode 84 on 2 October 1961, Channel Television from episode 180 on 3 September 1962 and Teledu Cymru (north and west Wales) from episode 184 on 17 September 1962. At this point, the ITV network became complete and the programme was broadcast almost continuously across the country at 7:30 pm on Monday and Wednesday for the next twenty-eight years.\nFrom episode 2981 on Friday 20 October 1989 at 7:30 pm, a third weekly episode was introduced and this increased to four episodes a week from episode 4096 on Sunday 24 November 1996, again at 7:30 pm. A second Monday episode was introduced in 2002 and was broadcast at 7:30 pm to usher in the return of Bet Lynch. The Monday 8:30 pm episode was used intermittently during the popular Richard Hillman storyline and became a regular feature from episode 5568 on Monday 25 August 2003.\nIn January 2008, ITV axed the Sunday episode and instead aired a second episode on Fridays, at 8:30 pm, with the final Sunday episode airing on 6 January 2008. From 23 July 2009 to September 2012 the Wednesday show was replaced with an episode at 8:30 pm on Thursdays. A sixth weekly episode was added on Wednesdays at 8:30 pm from 20 September 2017.In March 2020, it was revealed that episodes that were currently filming for future broadcast (as episodes are filmed a few weeks in advance) during the COVID-19 pandemic would be shown differently. Instead of six episodes a week, only three episodes would be broadcast, airing as normal on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday at the normal timeslot of 7:30 pm. The actions provided would be made effective starting from 30 March. Simultaneously, the announcement also mentioned that the elderly cast of the show would be \"written off\" due to health advice issued by Public Health England and the NHS. On 22 March, ITV released a statement confirming that filming of both Coronation Street and Emmerdale was suspended.In June 2020, ITV announced that filming will resume on 9 June. However, due to the new health and safety measures, cast members over the age of 70 or with underlying health conditions did not come back on set, until the production could determine it is safe for them to return.In July 2020 ITV announced Coronation Street would return to the normal output of six episodes a week in September 2020.In October 2020, Maureen Lipman and David Neilson made their first appearances since July as all cast members over the age of 70 had temporarily left the series earlier in the year. William Roache, Barbara Knox and Sue Nicholls returned in December.\nOn 22 January 2021, ITV announced that filming would be suspended from 25 January in order to rewrite \"stories and scripts as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic\" and to \"review all health and safety requirements\". ITV also confirmed that this decision would not affect their ability to deliver six episodes a week.In January 2022, it was announced that after 60 years in the 7.30pm slot, Coronation Street's transmission time would move to 8 pm due to the ITV Evening News receiving a longer duration, which pushes Emmerdale into the 7.30pm slot on weeknights. The double-bill episodes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays will merge into hour-long slots on these days.\n\n\n==== Repeats and classic episodes ====\nRepeat episodes, omnibus broadcasts and specials have been shown on various ITV channels. After several years on ITV2, in January 2008 the omnibus returned to the main ITV channel where it was aired on Saturday mornings/afternoons depending on the schedule and times. In May 2008 it moved to Sunday mornings until August 2008 when it returned to Saturdays. In January 2009 it moved back to Sunday mornings usually broadcasting at around 9.25am until December 2010. In January 2011 the omnibus moved to Saturday mornings on ITV at 9.25am. During the Rugby World Cup, which took place in New Zealand, matches had to be broadcast on a Saturday morning, so the omnibus moved to Saturday lunchtimes/afternoons during September and October 2011. On 22 October 2011 the omnibus moved back to Saturday mornings at 9.25am on ITV. In January 2012 the omnibus moved to ITV2 and then moved to ITV3 in January 2020. In January 2022 the omnibus moved back to ITV2.\nOlder episodes were broadcast by satellite and cable channel Granada Plus from its launch in 1996. The first episodes shown were from episode 1588 (originally transmitted on Monday 5 April 1976) onwards. Originally listed and promoted as Classic Coronation Street, the \"classic\" was dropped in early 2002, at which stage the episodes were from late 1989. By the time of the channel's closure in 2004, the repeats had reached February 1994.In addition to this, \"specials\" were broadcast on Saturday afternoons in the early years of the channel with several episodes based on a particular theme or character(s) were shown. The latest episode shown in these specials was from 1991. In addition, on 27 and 28 December 2003, several Christmas Day editions of the show were broadcast.\nITV3 began airing afternoon timeslot sequential reruns of Classic Coronation Street from 2 October 2017. Two classic episodes were retransmitted from Mondays to Fridays at 2:40 pm until 3:45 pm, starting from episode 2587 (originally transmitted on Wednesday 15 January 1986) onwards.To mark the 60th Anniversary of Coronation Street between 7 and 11 December 2020 at 10:00pm\u201311:05pm ITV3 aired special episodes of the soap including: Episode 1, the tenth anniversary episode from December 1970, two episodes from the twentieth anniversary in December 1980, two episodes from the thirtieth anniversary in December 1990, the 2000 live episode from the fortieth anniversary in December 2000, and the fiftieth anniversary episode which aired after a repeat of The Road to Coronation Street.\n\n\n=== International ===\nCoronation Street is shown in various countries worldwide. YouTube has the first episode and many others available as reruns.\nThe programme was first aired in Australia in 1963 on TCN-9 Sydney, GTV-9 Melbourne and NWS-9 Adelaide, and by 1966 Coronation Street was more popular in Australia than in the UK. The show eventually left free-to-air television in Australia in the 1970s. It briefly returned to the Nine Network in a daytime slot during 1994\u20131995. In 2005 STW-9 Perth began to show episodes before the 6 pm news to improve the lead in to Nine News Perth, but this did not work and the show was cancelled a few months later. In 1996, pay-TV began and Arena began screening the series in one-hour instalments on Saturdays and Sundays at 6:30 pm EST. The series was later moved to pay-TV channel UKTV (now BBC UKTV) where it is still shown. Coronation Street is shown Mon-Thu at 7:20 pm EST and a double episode on Fridays, with episodes on the channel being one week behind UK broadcast.\nIn Canada, Coronation Street is broadcast on CBC Television. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, beginning in the fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order to catch up with the ITV showings, at 6:30 pm and 7 pm local time Monday-Friday, with an omnibus on Sundays at 7.30am. By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30 pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto's CBLT in July 1966. The 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction. The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus. In 2004, CBC moved the weekday airings from their daytime slot to prime time. In light of austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is Coronation Street, according to the CBC's director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: \"Unofficially I can tell you Coronation Street is coming back. If it didn't come back, something would happen on Parliament Hill.\" Kirstine Stewart, the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: \"Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except maybe for curling viewers, of all CBC viewers.\" As of mid 2020, Canada is about two weeks behind the UK and airs four episodes per week.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Coronation Street is currently shown on Virgin Media One. The show was first aired in 1978, when RT\u00c92 began showing episodes from 1976, although Ireland caught up with the current UK episodes in 1983. In 1992 it moved to RT\u00c9 One, but in 2001 Granada TV bought 45 percent of TV3, and so TV3 broadcast the series from 2001 to 2014. In 2006, ITV sold its share of the channel but TV3 continued to buy the soap until the end of 2014 when it moved to UTV Ireland. Coronation Street has broadcast on each of the main Irish networks, except for the Irish language network TG4. In December 2016, Coronation Street returned to TV3 (now Virgin Media One). The show is consistently the channels most viewed programme every week.\nTwo Dutch stations have broadcast Coronation Street: VARA showed 428 episodes between 1967 and 1975, and SBS6 ran the show for a period starting in 2010. From 2006 the series was also broadcast by Vitaya, a small Flemish Belgian channel.\nIn New Zealand, Coronation Street has been shown locally since 1964, first on NZBC television until 1975, and then on TV One, which broadcasts it in a 4-episode/2-hour block on Fridays from 7:30 pm. In September 2014, TV One added a 2-episode/1-hour block on Saturday from 8:30 pm. Because TV One did not upgrade to showing the equivalent of five or six episodes per week, New Zealand continued to fall further and further behind with episodes, and was 23 months behind Britain as of March 2014. During the weekday nights of the week ending 11 April 2014 and previous weeks, Coronation Street was the least watched programme on TV One in the 7:30 pm slot by a considerable margin in comparison to other weeknights, The serial aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 pm until October 2011, when the show moved to a 5:30 pm half-hour slot every weekday. The move proved unpopular with fans, and the series was quickly moved into its present prime-time slot within weeks. Episodes 7883, 7884, 7885 and 7886 were screened on 16 May 2014. These were originally aired in the UK between 4 and 11 June 2012. On 10 May 2018 it was announced that the current 2016 episodes would be moved to 1 p.m. Monday-Friday titled 'Catch-up Episodes' and for primetime Wednesday-Friday express episodes would be airing in New Zealand a week behind The United Kingdom titled '2018 Episodes' these changes would be taking place from 11 June 2018.\nIn South Africa, Coronation Street episodes were broadcast three days after the UK air date on ITV Choice until the channel ceased broadcasting in June 2020, episodes temporarily went off the air until they moved to M-Net City starting October 2020.In the United States, Coronation Street is available by broadcast or cable only in northern markets where CBC coverage from Canada overlaps the border or is available on local cable systems. It was broadcast on CBC's US cable channel, Trio until the CBC sold its stake in the channel to Universal, before it was shut down in 2006. Beginning in 2009, episodes were available in the United States through Amazon.com's on-demand service, one month behind their original UK airdates. The final series of shows available from Amazon appears to be from November 2012, as no new episodes have been uploaded. On 15 January 2013, online distributor Hulu began airing episodes of the show, posting a new episode daily, two weeks after their original airdates. For a time, Hulu's website stated: \"New episodes of Coronation Street will be unavailable as of April 7th, 2016\", with the same being said for British soap Hollyoaks, but Hulu is once again showing new episodes of Coronation Street as of April 2017, two weeks behind the UK airdate. The BBC/ITV service Britbox shows new episodes on the same day as the UK airing. Coronation Street was also shown on USA Network for an unknown period starting in 1982.HM Forces and their families stationed overseas can watch Coronation Street on ITV, carried by the British Forces Broadcasting Service, which is also available to civilians in the Falkland Islands.

Edited by Bill Hill, the magazine contained a summary of recent storylines, interviews, articles about classic episodes, and stories that occurred from before 1960. The format was initially A5 size, expanding to A4 from the seventh issue. The magazine folded after issue 23 in 1993 when the publisher's contract with Granada Studios Tour expired and Granada wanted to produce their own magazine.On 25 June 2010, a video game of the show was released on Nintendo DS. The game was developed by Mindscape, and allowed players to complete tasks in the fictitious town of Weatherfield.\n\n\n=== Discography ===\nIn 1995, to commemorate the programme's 35th anniversary, a CD titled The Coronation Street Album was released, featuring cover versions of modern songs and standards by contemporary cast members.The album charted a Top 40 hit when \"The Coronation Street Single\" (a double a-side featuring a cover of Monty Python's \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" by Bill Waddington - with various cast members on backing vocals - on one side and  \"Something Stupid\" by Johnny Briggs & Amanda Barrie on the other) reached number 35 in the Official UK charts.\nIn 2010, an album featuring songs sung by cast members was released to celebrate 50 years of Coronation Street.

Swindley's management experience was tested when he was appointed assistant manager at a fictional department store, Dobson and Hawks. Granada produced two series of the spin-off, which ended in 1966.In 1967, Arthur Lowe returned as Leonard Swindley in Turn Out the Lights, a short-lived sequel to Pardon the Expression. It ran for just one series of six episodes before it was cancelled.From 1985 to 1988 Granada TV produced a sitcom called The Brothers McGregor featuring a pair of half-brothers (one black, one white) who had appeared in a single episode of Coronation Street as old friends of Eddie Yeats and guests at his wedding. The original actors were unavailable so the characters were recast with Paul Barber and Philip Whitchurch. The show ran for 26 episodes over four series.\nIn 1985, a sister series, Albion Market was launched. It ran for one year, with 100 episodes produced.\n\n\n==== Crossovers ====\nIn 2010, several actors from the show appeared on The Jeremy Kyle Show as their soap characters: David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) and Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). In the fictional, semi-improvised scenario, David accused Nick (his brother) and Tina (his ex-girlfriend) of sleeping together.Coronation Street and rival soap opera EastEnders had a crossover for Children in Need in November 2010 called \"East Street\". EastEnders stars that visited Weatherfield include Laurie Brett as Jane Beale, Charlie G. Hawkins as Darren Miller, Kylie Babbington as Jodie Gold, Nina Wadia as Zainab Masood and John Partridge as Christian Clarke.On 21 December 2012, Coronation Street produced a Text Santa special entitled A Christmas Corrie which featured Norris Cole in the style of Scrooge, being visited by the ghosts of dead characters.

Unlike other soaps which often used straight-to-video films to cover more contentious plot lines that may not be allowed by the broadcaster, Coronation Street has largely used these films to reset their characters in other locations.\nIn 1995, Coronation Street: The Cruise also known as Coronation Street: The Feature Length Special was released on VHS to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the show, featuring Rita Sullivan, Mavis Wilton, Alec Gilroy, Curly Watts and Raquel Watts.

The video depicts Freddie Mercury as a housewife, loosely based on Bet Lynch, who wants to \"break free\" from his life. Although Lynch was a blonde in the soap opera, Mercury thought he would look too silly as a blonde and chose a dark wig. Guitarist Brian May plays another, more relaxed housewife based on Hilda Ogden.As an April Fools' Day joke in 2019, TheJournal.ie claimed that Leader of the Opposition and Labour Jeremy Corbyn had made an attempt to appear in an episode of Coronation Street in response to Prime Minister Theresa May's supposed appearance in a special live episode, where she was to issue a final plea for unity on Brexit. In the joke, Corbyn's plan had not come to fruition, with members of Coronation Street's crew deeming his request inappropriate in light of the devastation already wreaked upon the soap opera's characters following its most recent knicker factory tragedy.\n\n\n== Sponsorship ==\nCadbury was the first sponsor of Coronation Street beginning in July 1996. In the summer of 2006, Cadbury Trebor Bassetts had to recall over one million chocolate bars, due to suspected salmonella contamination, and Coronation Street stopped the sponsorship for several months.

    "No Place Like Home (TV series)": "No Place Like Home is a BBC situation comedy series, created, and written by Jon Watkins. It was directed, produced by Robin Nash, starring William Gaunt and Patricia Garwood as Arthur and Beryl Crabtree. Arthur has a brand new life planned with Beryl now that the last of their four children have left home...or so he thinks! No Place Like Home was broadcast for five series between 1983 and 1987. Technically, six series were made, but  series 3 (7 episodes), which was intended for broadcast in 1985, was subsequently aired from January 1986, back to back with series 4 (6 episodes). This resulted in both of these series merging to become an extended series 3, with 13 episodes, ending in April 1986.\nLater in October 1986, a new series 4 of seven  episodes aired, and a final fifth series of 8 episodes was broadcast in 1987. The sitcom featured the first regular roles on television for Martin Clunes and Marcia Warren.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\"...Arthur and Beryl Crabtree had raised four children and looked forward to the day when their time once again would be their own; a second honeymoon was planned as the last of their offspring finally left home. However, their hopes were soon dashed as one by one the fledglings returned to the nest disillusioned with life in the outside world. For the children there was no place like home. The eldest of the children was Lorraine (Beverley Adams) who had married traffic warden Raymond Codd (Daniel Hill) but cast him aside in the final series. Raymond is replaced by a similar character, Roger Duff (Roger Martin), in Lorraine's affections. There was also Nigel, a veterinary student, Paul and Tracey (and their assorted girlfriends and boyfriends), while the Crabtrees' domestic bliss was also disturbed by their nosey neighbours the Bottings, particularly the shrieking, animal-loving Vera. Arthur, and Vera's husband Trevor, often escaped to the greenhouse when things became unbearable, seeking solace in a glass of home-made sherry....\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\nNo Place Like Home  was very popular, especially during the first three series where it was regular fixture in the Top Ten BBC programme ratings. However, like several comedies from the 1980s and 90s (Bread, Goodnight Sweetheart, and May to December are good examples), the last two series suffered from recasts and popular  characters disappearing without explanation. Both Marcia Warren and Martin Clunes, who both played arguably the series most popular characters, left at the end of the extended season 3 in 1986. Clunes' character, Nigel Crabtree, was immediately recast with Andrew Charleson taking over the part. Warren's character, the potty animal lover, Vera Botting, was rested for series 4, but returned in series 5, played by Ann Penfold.\nThe eldest Crabtree son, Paul, last appeared during series 4 and the character was not recast due to the death of actor Stephen Watson on his honeymoon during the filming of series 4.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== DVD releases ==\nThe first two series of No Place Like Home were released in 2006.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe Penguin TV Companion by Jeff Evans ISBN 0-14-051467-8\n\n\n== External links ==\nNo Place Like Home at IMDb\nNo Place Like Home at the BBC Comedy Guide",

    "Temecula massacre": "The Temecula massacre took place in December 1846 east of present-day Temecula, California, United States. It was part of a series of related events in the Mexican\u2013American War.  A combined force of California militia and Cahuilla Indians attacked and killed an estimated 33 to 40 Luise\u00f1o Indians. The Mexicans took the military action in retaliation for the Indians' killing 11 Californio lancers, in what was called the Pauma Massacre.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn a conflict that was part of the Mexican\u2013American War, in the Battle of San Pasqual on December 6, 1846, Andr\u00e9s Pico led a force of Californios against the United States. Soon after, a small group of the Mexican/Californio lancers requisitioned horses from the Pauma band for the war. The Luise\u00f1o Indians murdered the eleven Californios from Pico's forces in retaliation, in what became known as the Pauma Massacre. When the Mexican General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores in Los Angeles learned about this challenge to Mexican authority, he sent Jos\u00e9 del Carmen Lugo from San Bernardino with a force of men to capture and execute the tribal leaders responsible.\n\n\n== Events ==\nWhile en route to the Temecula Valley, Lugo encountered Chief Juan Antonio, leader of a group of Cahuilla Indians, who joined his forces.  The two groups set up camp along the Santa Gertrudis Creek.  Lugo was to wait for reinforcements from Los Angeles.  Learning that Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carrillo and a group of men were at the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, Lugo requested him to provide assistance.  Carrillo and his men joined Lugo and Chief Antonio.  Word reached the Temecula village that Californios from Los Angeles were headed to the valley.  The Luise\u00f1o went east into the canyon and hid.\nLugo sent a few men to find the Luise\u00f1o warriors.  The men reported back that the Luise\u00f1os were hiding.  Lugo knew if his men went into the canyon they would be trapped, so he decided to draw the Luise\u00f1o out of hiding and into his own trap. Just west of the canyon was a small meadow with rolling hills on either side.  The Cahuilla took position on one hill, and Lugo set his men on the other. Carrillo and his men went into the canyon, where they feigned fatigue. Young Indian warriors thought they saw an opportunity to take the Californios.  The chiefs tried to calm them, but the warriors attacked the Californios.\nCarrillo and his men fled from the canyon into the meadow, pulling the warriors in pursuit.  Once the war party was in the meadow, the Cahuilla and Lugo's men attacked the Luisenos, and Carrillo's men turned and attacked as well. Many warriors were killed; others surrendered.  A few warriors escaped and headed toward Aguanga.\nLugo turned over the captives to the Cahuilla, their traditional enemy. Lugo and a few men pursued the escaped Indians.  When Lugo returned, Chief Antonio had already killed all the prisoners.  The Californios and the Cahuilla regrouped at their campsite.  Another group of soldiers, led by Diego Sep\u00falveda, joined Lugo at the campsite.  Sep\u00falveda's men had been delayed joining Lugo.\nDuring the aftermath of the massacre, the Mormon Battalion passed through Temecula. The Mormons stood guard to prevent further bloodshed while the Luise\u00f1o people gathered their dead into a common grave.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of massacres in California\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHorace Parker, The Historic Valley of Temecula.

By this, they became affiliated to Deportivo Toluca F.C., who plays in Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Mexico.\nThe objective of Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense is to form players that can incorporate themselves from short or medium time to Deportivo Toluca F.C., and to make sure they understand how the Mexican League works.\nAtl\u00e9tico Mexiquense, in their short history, has had moments of glory, such as in their first season, (Invierno 97), where they finished as number 1 in the standings, with a total of 47 points. They were led by manager Marco Antonio Trejo. Also, in the Clausura 2004 season, Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense finished 2nd place in the standings and played for the first time in the Primera A Championship in their history against San Luis F.C., (who won and eventually ascended to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n).\nThe team does not have a special nickname, although some call them the \"Diablitos\" (Little Devils), \"pingos\", and \"demonios\" (Demons).\nAtl\u00e9tico Mexiquense for the 2009\u20132010 season did not complete in the new Liga de Ascenso since according to the FEMEXFUT did not meet the requirements to continue taking their place, and was relegated to the Second Division, also as part of this division also cuts out Socio \u00c1guila, Monterrey, Chihuahua Indians, Santos Laguna, Tigres \"B\" Jaguares de Tapachula, Tampico Madero, Academic Atlas, Tecos UAG and M\u00e9rida \"B\" (newly promoted).\n\n\n=== Restructuring ===\nIn the restructuring that occurred in Deportivo Toluca, Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense became the subsidiary team of Toluca and the official U17 and U20 teams are named Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense U17 and U20.\nFor the start of the Apertura 2015 season, The Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico was expanded to include 1 affiliate club for every team currently in the Liga MX. Each team will be named after the first division affiliate followed by \"Premier\". Toluca Premier will consist mainly of players moving up from the U20 team or young players who have been promoted but are finding minutes in the top flight hard to come by.\n\n\n== Stadium ==\nAtl\u00e9tico Mexiquense began at Estadio Nemesio D\u00edez (La Bombonera) in the city Toluca, alternating with their parent team.\nStarting in the Apertura 2005 season, Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense moved Ixtapan 90 Stadium, founded in the district of Ixtapan de la Sal, which counts with a capacity for 2,500 fans.\nThe team moved back to \"La Bombonera\" for the Apertura 2008\u201309 season.From the start of the Apertura 2015 season in Mexican football, Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense U20 plays home games at Estadio Nemesio D\u00edez, while Toluca Premier and Atl\u00e9tico Mexiquense U17 play home games at Estadio Instalaciones Metepec in the city of Metepec which has a capacity of 1,000 spectators.\n\n\n== Rosters ==\n\n\n=== Current U-20 roster ===\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

    "Ahmed Al-Shehri": "Wail Mohammed al-Shehri (Arabic: \u0648\u0627\u0626\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0631\u064a, W\u0101\u012bl ash-Shehr\u012b; also transliterated as Alshehri) (July 31, 1973 \u2013 September 11, 2001) was one of five terrorist hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11, which was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks.\nWail al-Shehri was an elementary school teacher from Khamis Mushait in the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. In early 2000, he traveled to Medina to seek treatment for mental problems. He and his younger brother Waleed traveled to Afghanistan in March 2000 and joined an Al-Qaeda training camp. The brothers were chosen, along with others from the same region of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the September 11 attacks. Once selected, al-Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport, then returned to Afghanistan. In March 2001, he recorded his last will and testament on video.\nAl-Shehri arrived in the United States in early June 2001, staying in budget motels in the Boynton Beach area of south Florida. On September 5, 2001, al-Shehri traveled to Boston and checked into a motel with his brother. Six days later, al-Shehri arrived early in the morning at Boston's Logan International Airport and boarded American Airlines Flight 11. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, al-Shehri, along with his brother and three others, hijacked the airliner.  They deliberately crashed it into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8:46 a.m.\nIn the aftermath of the attacks, some news reports mistakenly reported that al-Shehri was the son of a Saudi diplomat and was still alive and well. The al-Shehri family in Khamis Mushait spoke to the media, denying those early reports, saying that the al-Shehri brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nWail al-Shehri and his younger brother Waleed were from Khamis Mushait in the Asir province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern Saudi Arabia, along the Yemeni border. Al-Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar neighborhood in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of al-Shehri's brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may have been a major in the army and director of logistics. Al-Shehri's father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the Red Sea. The family strictly adhered to the Wahabi school of Islam, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the al-Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music or contact with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English; however, he knew little English.During high school and college, al-Shehri was deeply religious and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Al-Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many young people in the region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Al-Shehri's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.After graduating from Abha teachers college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri took a job as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months into the job, al-Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, al-Shehri sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the al-Shehri brothers in Medina.\n\n\n== Afghanistan ==\n\nWail and Waleed al-Shehri disappeared after going to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were vague about when they would return. Both had expressed interest in joining the jihad in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the al-Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque to swear an oath and commitment to jihad, as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail al-Shehri presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.In March 2000, he left for Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, they went on to Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri followed the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot (\"muscle\") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain visas to travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.Once al-Shehri and the other muscle hijackers completed their training in Afghanistan, they received $2,000 so they could return to Saudi Arabia to obtain new passports and visas. The al-Shehri brothers may have been assisted by a relative who worked in the Saudi passport office. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri received passports on October 3, 2000, and then obtained United States visas on October 24. On his visa application, Wail al-Shehri provided vague information, stating his employer/school as \"South City\", and his destination as \"Wasantwn\". Al-Shehri indicated his occupation as \"teacher\", and that he would be traveling with his brother on a four-to-six month vacation, which would be paid for with al-Shehri's teacher salary. Although he would not be working while on vacation, consular officials nonetheless did not question if the al-Shehri brothers had the financial means to support themselves while in the United States.In late 2000, al-Shehri traveled to the United Arab Emirates, where he purchased traveler's checks, presumed to have been paid for by Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Five other hijackers passed through the United Arab Emirates and purchased traveler's checks, including Majed Moqed, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Hamza al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al-Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami. The 9/11 Commission believes that in mid-November 2000, three of the future muscle hijackers, including the al-Shehri brothers, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.Wail al-Shehri appeared together with hijackers Ahmed al-Nami, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and Ahmed al-Ghamdi on a video recorded in March 2001, and aired on Al Jazeera in September 2002. Al-Shehri was seen studying maps and flight manuals, but he did not speak in the video; it also included a segment of Abdulaziz al-Omari reading his last will and testament. While in Afghanistan, another video was recorded that showed al-Shehri reading his last will and testament. This video was released on September 7, 2006.\n\n\n== United States ==\nOn June 5, 2001, Wail al-Shehri obtained an International Driving Permit, which was issued in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. Al-Shehri arrived together with fellow al-Qaeda member Ahmed al-Haznawi at Miami International Airport, via London, from Dubai on June 8. Both were admitted as tourists for six months. Al-Shehri opened a bank account at SunTrust Bank in Florida on June 18, with a deposit of $8,000 that came from American Express traveler's cheques purchased on June 7 in the United Arab Emirates.Al-Shehri moved into the Homing Inn, a budget motel in Boynton Beach, on June 21, 2001, sharing a room with his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami. Wail al-Shehri and al-Suqami both used this hotel as their address when they received Florida state non-driver identifications on July 3. Al-Shehri checked into the Panther Motel & Apartments, in Deerfield Beach, with his brother and al-Suqami on August 2, staying there until August 10. While in Florida, al-Shehri was a member of the World Gym in Boynton Beach, where he trained with Waleed and al-Suqami. During the summer of 2001, al-Shehri regularly used computers at the Delray Beach Public Library.On August 28, 2001, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri made reservations on American Airlines Flight 11, using the Mail Boxes Etc. in Hollywood, Florida, as their address. The al-Shehri brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone to change their first-class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11, selecting seats on the side of the aircraft that offered a direct view of the cockpit. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri left Florida for Boston on September 5, traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462.Wail al-Shehri checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, on September 5, 2001, staying in room 432. While staying at the Park Inn, the brothers may have called a prostitute. Wail al-Shehri accompanied his brother on September 9 to the Travelex at Logan International Airport, where Waleed attempted to wire $5,000 to the United Arab Emirates. Waleed had insufficient documentation, so the brothers returned the next day to complete the transaction. Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad received the funds on September 11 at Al-Ansari Exchange in Sharjah. Hijacker Abdulaziz al-Omari possibly spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with Mohamed Atta for Portland, Maine, on September 10. When Wail and Waleed al-Shehri checked out on September 11, they left a sheet of instructions for flying a jet behind in their hotel room.\n\n\n== Attacks ==\n\nWail al-Shehri, his brother Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.By 07:40, all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight 11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. It is suspected that the brothers stabbed two flight attendants in the hijacking. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta, who was flying the plane, deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nWaleed al-Shehri was reported to have been found alive by a BBC News article on September 23, 2001, and other news reports in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Reports said that the al-Shehri brothers were the sons of a Saudi diplomat stationed in New Delhi, Ahmed al-Shehri. The diplomat's son was trained as a pilot at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida, and was working as a pilot for Saudi Arabian Airlines. At the time of the attacks, he was in Morocco for a training program. There were also reports that Wail al-Shehri was a trained pilot. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, Saudi officials suggested that Wail and Waleed al-Shehri were victims of identity theft, but the diplomat's son was the victim of mistaken identity.Jamal Khashoggi, of Al-Watan and ArabNews in Saudi Arabia, spoke with Muhammad Ali al-Shehri in Khamis Mushait, who said his sons Wail and Waleed had been missing for months. He denied reports that Wail had an aeronautics degree, as some news reports said, \"My son Wail was 25 years old and had a BA in physical education from the Abha Teacher\u2019s College. He was mentally ill and had gone to numerous clerics for assistance in overcoming this instability. He had asked the school, where he taught, for a 6-month leave to go to Madinah.\" His father also told reporters that he dreaded having to believe that his sons were involved in the September 11 attacks, \"If that turns out to be the truth, then I'll never, never accept it from them. I'll never forgive them for that.\" Family members said that Wail and Waleed became very religious in the months before they disappeared, had expressed interest in going to Chechnya, and hoped for martyrdom. In a report entitled \"A Saudi Apology\" for Dateline NBC aired on August 25, 2002, John Hockenberry traveled to Asir, where he interviewed another al-Shehri brother, Salah, who agreed that Wail and Waleed were deceased. Salah described them as not very religious, and suggested they had been brainwashed.Saudi officials later stated that the names of the hijackers were in fact correct, and that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi. In response to 9/11 conspiracy theories surrounding its original news story suggesting hijackers were still alive, the BBC stated in 2006 that later reports on the hijackers superseded the original story. The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHijackers in the September 11 attacks\nPENTTBOM\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Wail al-Shehri at Wikimedia Commons",

However, Charles attacks the Liars inside the dollhouse, drugs them and puts them in a morgue. When they are ordered to go back to their rooms, the Liars are subjected to more torture over the next three weeks.\nBack in Rosewood, after three weeks of the girls being missing, Alison (Sasha Pieterse) delivers a statement at a press conference where she blames Andrew for the kidnapping. However, it turns out that the press conference is part of a plan to lure 'A' to Alison. Ali evades the police and, with the help of Ezra (Ian Harding), Caleb (Tyler Blackburn) and Toby (Keegan Allen), distracts them so 'A' can come after Ali.\nAfter weeks of 'A's' torture, the Liars emerge from their rooms, traumatized over what they have gone through and are instructed to prepare Ali's room for her \"arrival.\" As they sort through the boxes, they discover that Charles is a DiLaurentis and that Mona has been trapped for the last few weeks.

Ali, and the boys hear the bells of the alarm and spot trails of smoke coming from underground. The Liars race through the corridor and find a completely unraveled Mona trapped in a hole and rescue her. Ali, Ezra, and Caleb find a locked door and open it just as all the girls come running out. Lieutenant Tanner (Roma Maffia) and the police arrive not long after just as the Liars are reunited with their loved ones.\nThe police examines the dollhouse, but don't find any trail of Charles. One of the cops finds another girl with a yellow top in the dollhouse who claims to be Sara Harvey, (Dre Davis) the girl who went missing the day after Alison as the Liars previously found out from Sara's friends. Spencer tells Toby that they know what the real name of 'A' is and Toby tells her that the police suspect that Andrew is their tormentor, and Emily asks Ali if she knows who Charles DiLaurentis is.\n\n\n== Production ==\n\"Game On, Charles\" was written by I. Marlene King and Lijah J. Barasz, and was directed by Chad Lowe. Barasz revealed that she wrote the parts outside 'A's dollhouse, with King writing the scenes in which the Liars are inside the dollhouse. The title of the premiere, \"Game On, Charles\", was revealed by King after the fifth-season finale. The table read for the premiere began on March 23, 2015. Filming for the sixth season began on March 24, 2015, and ended on April 1, 2015. The episode featured the songs \"Don't Fence Me In\" by Cole Porter, \"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\" by Glenn Miller, \"Walkin' After Midnight\" by Patsy Cline and \"Hush, Little Baby\" which was sung by Janel Parrish. The episode focuses on the Liars' captivity in the dollhouse where they are being trapped for over three weeks. It also focuses on Ezra, Caleb, Toby and Alison as they try their hardest to try to locate the girls.\n\nJanel Parrish confirmed in an interview that she would be returning to the sixth season as a series regular after her character, Mona Vanderwaal, was supposedly killed in the mid-season finale of season 5.\nIn previous episode, the fifth-season finale, it was revealed that Mona was alive and had been held prisoner in 'A's dollhouse. It was announced on March 25, 2015, that Project Runway alum Dre Davis was cast as Kimberly Brown. However, it was revealed that Davis would instead be playing Sara Harvey, a girl who went missing the same time as Alison. Titus Makin Jr. was announced to be cast as Lorenzo, a cop assigned to watch over Alison and also her new boyfriend.Executive producer Oliver Goldstick revealed in an interview that the first half of the sixth season, would contain 10 episodes instead of 12, like the previous seasons and will deal almost exclusively with the mystery of Charles DiLaurentis and every unanswered \"A\" mystery question since the start of the show. I. Marlene King commented on where the premiere would begin as she said \"We will start next season right were we left off, with the girls trapped and they don't get out immediately,\" King previews, adding that \"season six takes place in a very condensed period of time.\" In an interview with Entertainment Tonight King commented on the first part of the sixth season and the premiere, as she said \"It gets as dark as we could possibly go on Pretty Little Liars,\"\nAs a regard to who 'A' is going to be, King said \"We knew that Mona was the original \"A,\" but we didn't know how long we were going to be able to go to sustain that story before we gave her up to the audience. We knew there was going to be a \"Big A\" to follow that story up, and we stayed true to those characters.\" King revealed in an interview with BuzzFeed that because of the frustration from the audience, the final 'A' reveal was moved from the series finale to the sixth season mid-season finale. She continued saying that \"The fans have been really patient, and I feel like we pushed them as far as we could.\" The story of Charles was pitched by King to the writer's room after the end of the second season, after the reveal of Mona as 'A'. King said - As we were ending that story, I started to freak out. I was like, I don\u2019t want to write one more episode without knowing who was going to steal the game from her. I will say that for two or three episodes, there were three people who were going to be \u2018A,\u2019 and then we got about two episodes in and I pitched to the room this new idea that it wasn\u2019t any of those three and I told the story of Charles and everybody\u2019s mouths dropped. - I. Marlene King to BuzzFeed\nJoseph Dougherty, executive producer, expressed his concern over the amount of material the writers had to deal with in the first half of the sixth season in order to reveal who 'A' is when crafting the first ten episodes. He continued to call the season four finale \"the previous high-water mark for maximum signal-to-noise information.\"\n\n\n== Reception ==\n\n\n=== Broadcasting ===\n\"Game On, Charles\" premiered on ABC Family on June 2, 2015. It was watched by 2.38 million viewers and acquired a 1.1 rating in the 18-49 key demographic, making it the least watched season premiere in the show's history.

The show also became Twitter's number one scripted cable TV series telecast of all time.\n\n\n=== Reviews ===\nThe episode received mixed to positive reviews by critics. Many critics were pleased with the premiere, with many commenting on the focus of the girls finding out who 'A' really is. Mark Trammell from TVEquals called the premiere a \"solid enough premiere\" and expressed his excitement of how the fallout of the events in the premiere will affect the rest of the season. Kelsey from Melty called the premiere \"astonishing\".Gavin Hetherington of SpoilerTV cited this episode as the best premiere of the show to date. He called it a \"stellar premiere\" and went on to say the episode was \"filled with great moments - both terrifying and satisfying - and showed the girls really start to take control and fight back.\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly Isabella Biedenharn mentioned the shows darker tone as he said \"PLL has always been sort of terrifying, but this episode approached horror movie levels.\" She continued saying that the premiere raised many questions as she commented \"This season\u2019s shaping up to be a doozy.\"Paul Dailly from TV Fanatics praised the actresses performance as he said \"This tested all of their acting chops on a scale never seen on this show before. Did anyone else just want to hug Mona?\" He was more negative towards the episode itself as he said \"\"Game on, Charles\" was a rather disappointing affair. Considering the episode order has been shaved this season, they really could have fit a lot more in. As much as I love the sarcasm of the girls, some of that could have been traded in for some more answers. Yes, we need those when we are six seasons in.\"Nick Campbell from TV.com gave a negative review as he was critical towards the show's realistic plot as she said \"There's a lot that happened in that last scene that's hard to swallow if you're still the kind of viewer that wanted things to make sense.

    "Kiowa": "Iowa ( (listen)) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, bordered by the Mississippi River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north.\nDuring the 18th and early 19th centuries, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt. In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy transitioned to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production.Iowa is the 26th most extensive in total area and the 31st most populous of the 50 U.S. states, with a population of 3,190,369, according to the 2020 census. The state's capital, most populous city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa. Iowa has been listed as one of the safest U.S. states in which to live.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIowa derives its name from the Ioway people, one of the many Native American nations whose territory comprised the future state at the time of European colonization.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nWhen American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric Oneota include the Dakota, Ho-Chunk, Ioway, and Otoe. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the Illiniwek, Meskwaki, Omaha, and Sauk.\n\n\n=== Early colonization and trade, 1673\u20131808 ===\n\nThe first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indigenous villages on the Iowa side. The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. The French, before their impending defeat in the French and Indian War, transferred ownership to their ally, Spain. Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trading licenses to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers.Iowa was part of a territory known as La Louisiane or Louisiana, and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indigenous people. The Sauk and Meskwaki effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Among the early traders on the Mississippi were Julien Dubuque, Robert de la Salle, and Paul Marin. Along the Missouri River at least five French and English trading houses were built before 1808. In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty.After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts\u2014the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The Indiana Territory was created in 1800 to exercise jurisdiction over this portion of the District; William Henry Harrison was its first governor. Much of Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805, but it was not until the construction of Fort Madison in 1808 that the U.S. established tenuous military control over the region.\n\n\n=== War of 1812 and unstable U.S. control ===\n\nFort Madison was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Fox, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory. Fort Madison was defeated by British-supported Indigenous people in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, also fell to the British. Black Hawk took part in the siege of Fort Madison. Another small military outpost was established along the Mississippi River in present-day Bellevue. This poorly situated stockade was similarly attacked by hundreds of Indigenous people in 1813, but was successfully defended and later abandoned until settlers returned to the area in the mid-1830s.After the war, the U.S. re-established control of the region through the construction of Fort Armstrong, Fort Snelling in Minnesota, and Fort Atkinson in Nebraska.\n\n\n=== Indian removal, 1814\u20131832 ===\nThe United States encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west. A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison (then governor of the Indiana Territory) that surrendered much of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War.The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley during 1832 in the Black Hawk Purchase and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of them moving to a reservation in Kansas. Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki Settlement remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land. However, in contrast to the unprecedented act of the Iowa Legislature, the United States Federal Government, through the use of Treaties, forced the Ho-Chunk from Iowa in 1848, and forced the Dakota from Iowa by 1858. Western Iowa around modern Council Bluffs was used as an Indian Reservation for members of the Council of Three Fires.\n\n\n=== U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832\u20131860 ===\n\nThe first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833. Primarily, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River, founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue. On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa. President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from Natives, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at Fairfield. The first fair was held October 25\u201327, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held annually since then, except for a few exceptions: 1898 due to the Spanish\u2013American War and the World's Fair being held in nearby Omaha, Nebraska; from 1942 to 1945, due to World War II, as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot; and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.\n\n\n=== Civil War, 1861\u20131865 ===\n\nIowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was an antiwar \"Copperhead\" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war. There were no battles in the state, although the Battle of Athens, Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from Croton, Iowa, and shots from the battle landed in Iowa. Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities.Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood, its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more men to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates surrendered at Appomattox.Most fought in the great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley and in the South. Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth. They served with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and fought under Union General Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley. Many died and were buried at Andersonville. They marched on General Nathaniel Banks' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven Iowans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals\u2014Grenville Mellen Dodge, Samuel R. Curtis, Francis J. Herron, and Frederick Steele\u2014and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.\n\n\n=== Agricultural expansion, 1865\u20131930 ===\nFollowing the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860 to 1,624,615 in 1880. The American Civil War briefly brought higher profits.In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war. In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s, which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area, Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations.\n\n\n=== Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930\u20131985 ===\nThe transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period after World War II witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.In 1975, Governor Robert D. Ray petitioned President Ford to allow Iowa to accept and resettle Tai Dam refugees fleeing the Indochina War.  An exception was required for this resettlement as State Dept policy at the time forbid resettlement of large groups of refugees in concentrated communities; an exception was ultimately granted and 1200 Tai Dam were resettled in Iowa.  Since then Iowa has accepted thousands of refugees from Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Bhutan, and Burma.The farm crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression. The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.\n\n\n=== Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985\u2013present ===\nAfter bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to reduce its dependence on agriculture. By the early 21st century, it was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services. The population of Iowa has increased at a slower rate than the U.S. as a whole since at least the 1900 census, though Iowa now has a predominantly urban population. The Iowa Economic Development Authority, created in 2011 has replaced the Iowa Department of Economic Development and its annual reports are a source of economic information.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Boundaries ===\n\nIowa is bordered by the Mississippi River on the east and the Missouri River and the Big Sioux River on the west. The northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude. The southern border is the Des Moines River and a not-quite-straight line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Missouri v. Iowa (1849) after a standoff between Missouri and Iowa known as the Honey War.Iowa is the only state whose east and west borders are formed almost entirely by rivers.  Carter Lake, Iowa, is the only city in the state located west of the Missouri River.Iowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. The state capital, Des Moines, is in Polk County.\n\n\n=== Geology and terrain ===\nIowa's bedrock geology generally decreases in age from east to west. In northwest Iowa, Cretaceous bedrock can be 74 million years old; in eastern Iowa Cambrian bedrock dates to c. 500 million years ago.Iowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation, soils, topography, and river drainage. Loess hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick. Northeast Iowa along the Upper Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Area, consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear as mountainous.Several natural lakes exist, most notably Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and East Okoboji Lake in northwest Iowa (see Iowa Great Lakes). To the east lies Clear Lake. Man-made lakes include Lake Odessa, Saylorville Lake, Lake Red Rock, Coralville Lake, Lake MacBride, and Rathbun Lake. Before European settlement, 4 to 6 million acres of the state was covered with wetlands, about 95% of these wetlands have been drained.\n\n\n=== Ecology and environment ===\n\nIowa's natural vegetation is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas. Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.The southern part of Iowa is categorized as the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion. The Northern, drier part of Iowa is categorized as part of the Central tall grasslands.There is a dearth of natural areas in Iowa; less than 1% of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remains intact; only about 5% of the state's prairie pothole wetlands remain, and most of the original forest has been lost. As of 2005 Iowa ranked 49th of U.S. states in public land holdings. Threatened or endangered animals in Iowa include the interior least tern, piping plover, Indiana bat, pallid sturgeon, the Iowa Pleistocene land snail, Higgins' eye pearly mussel, and the Topeka shiner. Endangered or threatened plants include western prairie fringed orchid, eastern prairie fringed orchid, Mead's milkweed, prairie bush clover, and northern wild monkshood.The explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality.Other factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants, fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production, and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 \u00b0F (7 \u00b0C), while Keokuk, on the Mississippi River, averages 52 \u00b0F (11 \u00b0C). Snowfall is common, with Des Moines getting about 26 days of snowfall a year, and other places, such as Shenandoah getting about 11 days of snowfall in a year.Spring ushers in the beginning of the severe weather season. Iowa averages about 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year. The 30-year annual average of tornadoes in Iowa is 47. In 2008, twelve people were killed by tornadoes in Iowa, making it the deadliest year since 1968 and also the second most tornadoes in a year with 105, matching the total from 2001.Iowa summers are known for heat and humidity, with daytime temperatures sometimes near 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) and occasionally exceeding 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). Average winters in the state have been known to drop well below freezing, even dropping below \u221218 \u00b0F (\u221228 \u00b0C). Iowa's all-time hottest temperature of 118 \u00b0F (48 \u00b0C) was recorded at Keokuk on July 20, 1934, during a nationwide heat wave; the all-time lowest temperature of \u221247 \u00b0F (\u221244 \u00b0C) was recorded in Washta on January 12, 1912.\nIowa has a relatively smooth gradient of varying precipitation across the state, with areas in the southeast of the state receiving an average of over 38 inches (97 cm) of rain annually, and the northwest of the state receiving less than 28 inches (71 cm). The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal, with more rain falling in the summer months. Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, and the wettest month is June, owing to frequent showers and thunderstorms, some of which produce hail, damaging winds and/or tornadoes. In Des Moines, roughly in the center of the state, over two-thirds of the 34.72 inches (88.2 cm) of rain falls from April through September, and about half the average annual precipitation falls from May through August, peaking in June.\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\nIowa's population is more urban than rural, with 61 percent living in urban areas in 2000, a trend that began in the early 20th century. Urban counties in Iowa grew 8.5% from 2000 to 2008, while rural counties declined by 4.2%. The shift from rural to urban has caused population increases in more urbanized counties such as Dallas, Johnson, Linn, Polk, and Scott, at the expense of more rural counties.Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota), is feeling the brunt of rural flight, although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as Denison and Storm Lake, have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.Another demographic problem for Iowa is the brain drain, in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment. During the 1990s, Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single, educated young adults, second only to North Dakota.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Population ===\nThe United States Census Bureau determined the population of Iowa was 3,190,369 on April 1, 2020, a 4.73% increase since the 2010 United States census.Of the residents of Iowa, 70.8% were born in Iowa, 23.6% were born in a different U.S. state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5% were foreign born.Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 29,386 people, while migration within the country produced a net loss of 41,140 people. 6.5% of Iowa's population were reported as under the age of five, 22.6% under 18, and 14.7% were 65 or older. Males made up approximately 49.6% of the population. The population density of the state is 52.7 people per square mile. As of the 2010 Census, the center of population of Iowa is in Marshall County, near Melbourne.As of the 2010 Census, the population of Iowa was 3,046,355. The gender makeup of the state was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. 23.9% of the population were under the age of 18; 61.2% were between the ages of 18 and 64; and 14.9% were 65 years of age or older.\n\nAccording to the 2016 American Community Survey, 5.6% of Iowa's population were of Hispanic or Latino origin (of any race): Mexican (4.3%), Puerto Rican (0.2%), Cuban (0.1%), and other Hispanic or Latino origin (1.0%). The five largest ancestry groups were: German (35.1%), Irish (13.5%), English (8.2%), American (5.8%), and Norwegian (5.0%).\n\n\n=== Birth data ===\n\nNote: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\n\nSince 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one Hispanic group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nA 2014 survey by Pew Research Center found 60% of Iowans are Protestant, while 18% are Catholic, and 1% are of non-Christian religions. 21% responded with non-religious, and 1% did not answer. A survey from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) in 2010 found that the largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 235,190 adherents and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 229,557. The largest non-Protestant religion was Catholicism with 503,080 adherents. The state has a great number of Calvinist denominations.

Natives of northern Iowa\u2014including Sioux City, Fort Dodge, and the Waterloo region\u2014tend to speak the dialect linguists call North Central American English, which is also found in North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Natives of central and southern Iowa\u2014including such cities as Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, and Iowa City\u2014tend to speak the North Midland dialect also found in eastern Nebraska, central Illinois, and central Indiana. Natives of East-Central Iowa\u2014including cities such as Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, and Clinton tend to speak with the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, a dialect that extends from this area and east across the Great Lakes Region.After English, Spanish is the second-most-common language spoken in Iowa, with 120,000 people in Iowa of Hispanic or Latino origin and 47,000 people born in Latin America. The third-most-common language is German, spoken by 17,000 people in Iowa; two notable German dialects used in Iowa include Amana German spoken around the Amana Colonies, and Pennsylvania German, spoken among the Amish in Iowa.

This economic diversity has helped Iowa weather the late 2000s recession better than most states, with unemployment substantially lower than the rest of the nation.If the economy is measured by gross domestic product, in 2005 Iowa's GDP was about $124 billion. If measured by gross state product, for 2005 it was $113.5 billion. Its per capita income for 2006 was $23,340.On July 2, 2009, Standard & Poor's rated the state of Iowa's credit as AAA (the highest of its credit ratings, held by only 11 U.S. state governments).As of September 2021, the state's unemployment rate is 4.0%.\n\n\n=== Manufacturing ===\nManufacturing is the largest sector of Iowa's economy, with $20.8 billion (21%) of Iowa's 2003 gross state product. Major manufacturing sectors include food processing, heavy machinery, and agricultural chemicals. Sixteen percent of Iowa's workforce is dedicated to manufacturing.Food processing is the largest component of manufacturing.

Iowa ranks fifth in the nation in total number of organic farms. In 2016, there were approximately 732 organic farms in the state, an increase of about 5% from the previous year, and 103,136 organic acres, an increase of 9,429 from the previous year. Iowa has also seen an increase in demand for local, sustainably-grown food. Northeast Iowa, part of the Driftless Area, has led the state in development of its regional food system and grows and consumes more local food than any other region in Iowa.Iowa's Driftless Region is also home to the nationally recognized Seed Savers Exchange, a non-profit seed bank housed at an 890-acre heritage farm near Decorah, in the northeast corner of the state. The largest nongovernmental seed bank of its kind in the United States, Seed Savers Exchange safeguards more than 20,000 varieties of rare, heirloom seeds.\n\nAs of 2007, the direct production and sale of conventional agricultural commodities contributed only about 3.5% of Iowa's gross state product. In 2002 the impact of the indirect role of agriculture in Iowa's economy, including agriculture-affiliated business, was calculated at 16.4% in terms of value added and 24.3% in terms of total output. This was lower than the economic impact of non-farm manufacturing, which accounted for 22.4% of total value added and 26.5% of total output. Iowa's main conventional agricultural commodities are hogs, corn, soybeans, oats, cattle, eggs, and dairy products. Iowa is the nation's largest producer of ethanol and corn and some years is the largest grower of soybeans. In 2008, the 92,600 farms in Iowa produced 19% of the nation's corn, 17% of the soybeans, 30% of the hogs, and 14% of the eggs.As of 2009 major Iowa agricultural product processors include Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Inc., Diamond V Mills, and Quaker Oats.\n\n\n=== Health insurance ===\nAs of 2014, there were 16 organizations offering health insurance products in Iowa, per the State of Iowa Insurance Division.\nIowa was fourth out of ten states with the biggest drop in competition levels of health insurance between 2010 and 2011, per the 2013 annual report on the level of competition in the health insurance industry by the American Medical Association using 2011 data from HealthLeaders-Interstudy, the most comprehensive source of data on enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), point-of-service (POS) and consumer-driven health care plans.\nAccording to the AMA annual report from 2007 Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield had provided 71% of the state's health insurance.The Iowa Insurance Division \"Annual report to the Iowa Governor and the Iowa Legislature\" from November 2014 looked at the 95% of health insurers by premium, which are 10 companies. It found Wellmark Inc. to dominate the three health insurance markets it examined (individual, small group and large group) at 52\u201367%.:\u200a2\u200a Wellmark HealthPlan of Iowa and Wellmark Inc had the highest risk-based capital percentages of all 10 providers at 1158% and 1132%, respectively.:\u200a31\u200a Rising RBC is an indication of profits.:\u200a31\u200a\n\n\n=== Other sectors ===\n\nIowa has a strong financial and insurance sector, with approximately 6,100 firms, including AEGON, Nationwide Group, Aviva USA, Farm Bureau Financial Services, Voya Financial, Marsh Affinity Group, MetLife, Principal Financial Group, Principal Capital Management, Wells Fargo, and University of Iowa Community Credit Union.\nIowa is host to at least two business incubators, Iowa State University Research Park and the BioVentures Center at the University of Iowa. The Research Park hosts about 50 companies, among them NewLink Genetics, which develops cancer immunotherapeutics, and the U.S. animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetmedica.Ethanol production consumes about a third of Iowa's corn production, and renewable fuels account for eight percent of the state's gross domestic product. A total of 39 ethanol plants produced 3.1 billion US gallons (12,000,000 m3) of fuel in 2009.\nRenewable energy has become a major economic force in northern and western Iowa, with wind turbine electrical generation increasing exponentially since 1990. In 2019, wind power in Iowa accounted for 42% of electrical energy produced, and 10,201 megawatts of generating capacity had been installed at the end of the year. Iowa ranked first of U.S. states in percentage of total power generated by wind and second in wind generating capacity behind Texas. Major producers of turbines and components in Iowa include Acciona Energy of West Branch, TPI Composites of Newton, and Siemens Energy of Fort Madison.\nIn 2016, Iowa was the headquarters for three of the top 2,000 companies for revenue.

Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property. Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed by more than one taxing authority. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, school district and special levies. Iowa allows its residents to deduct their federal income taxes from their state income taxes.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\n\nIowa was one of the leading states in the high school movement, and continues to be among the top educational performers today.The four-year graduation rate for high schoolers was 91.3% in 2017. Iowa's schools are credited with the highest graduation rate in the nation as of 2019. Iowa has 333 school districts, 1,329 school buildings and has the 14th lowest student-to-teacher ratio of 14.2. Teacher pay is ranked 22nd, with the average salary being $55,647.As of 2015 transportation spending is a significant part of the budgets of rural school districts as many are geographically large and must transport students across vast distances. This reduces the amount of money spent on other aspects of the districts.The state's oldest functioning school building is located in Bellevue in the historic Jackson County Courthouse which has been in continuous use as a school since 1848.\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe Iowa Board of Regents is composed of nine citizen volunteers appointed by the governor to provide policymaking, coordination, and oversight of the state's three public universities, two special K\u201312 schools, and affiliated centers.The special K\u201312 schools include the Iowa School for the Deaf in Council Bluffs and the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School in Vinton.

Fort Madison is served by Amtrak's Southwest Chief, running between Chicago and Los Angeles. Both trains currently run tri-weekly and are expected to return to daily service in June.\n\n\n== Law and government ==\n\n\n=== State ===\n\nAs of 2018, the 43rd and current Governor of Iowa is Kim Reynolds (R). Other statewide elected officials are:\n\nAdam Gregg (R), Lieutenant Governor\nPaul Pate (R), Secretary of State\nRob Sand (D), Auditor of State\nMichael Fitzgerald (D), Treasurer of State\nMike Naig (R), Secretary of Agriculture\nTom Miller (D), Attorney GeneralThe Code of Iowa contains Iowa's statutory laws. It is periodically updated by the Iowa Legislative Service Bureau, with a new edition published in odd-numbered years and a supplement published in even-numbered years.\nIowa is an alcohol monopoly or alcoholic beverage control state.\n\n\n=== National ===\n\nThe two U.S. Senators:\n\nChuck Grassley (R), in office since 1981\nJoni Ernst (R), in office since 2015The four U.S. Representatives:\n\nAshley Hinson (R), First district\nMariannette Miller-Meeks (R), Second district\nCindy Axne (D), Third district\nRandy Feenstra (R), Fourth districtAfter the 2010 United States Census and the resulting redistricting, Iowa lost one seat in Congress, falling to four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Incumbent U.S. Representatives Leonard Boswell (D) and Tom Latham (R) ran against each other in 2012 in the third congressional district which had new boundaries; Latham won and retired after the 2014 elections. King represented the old fifth congressional district.\n\n\n=== Political parties ===\n\nIn Iowa, the term \"political party\" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the \"last preceding general election\". Iowa recognizes three political parties\u2014the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Libertarian Party. The Libertarian Party obtained official political party status in 2017 as a result of presidential candidate Gary Johnson receiving 3.8% of the Iowa vote in the 2016 general election. Third parties, officially termed \"nonparty political organizations\", can appear on the ballot as well. Four of these have had candidates on the ballot in Iowa since 2004 for various positions: the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Pirate Party, and the Socialist Workers Party.\n\n\n=== Voter trends ===\n\nAs a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the Iowa General Assembly: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor Chet Culver was defeated in 2010 by Republican Terry Branstad, who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3 days; eclipsing George Clinton, who served 21 years until 1804. Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China.\n\n\n=== Presidential caucus ===\n\nThe state gets considerable attention every four years because the Iowa caucus, gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a presidential primary election.\nAlong with the New Hampshire primary the following week, Iowa's caucuses have become the starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president. The national and international media give Iowa and New Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage. In 2007 presidential campaign spending was the seventh highest in the country.\n\n\n=== Civil rights ===\nIn a 2020 study, Iowa was ranked as the 24th easiest state for citizens to vote in.\n\n\n==== Racial equality ====\n\nIn the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court\u2014In Re the Matter of Ralph, decided July 1839\u2014the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War. The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban miscegenation statutes nationwide.The Iowa Supreme Court decided Clark v. The board of directors in 1868, ruling that racially segregated \"separate but equal\" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before Brown v. Board of Education. By 1875, a number of additional court rulings effectively ended segregation in Iowa schools. Social and housing discrimination continued against Blacks at state universities until the 1950s. The Court heard Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co. in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: \"All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement.\" However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de facto discrimination to continue. Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore. Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.\n\n\n==== Women's rights ====\nAs with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes. In 1847, the University of Iowa became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis. In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella A. Mansfield to the practice of law. Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919. In 1894 women were given \"partial suffrage\", which allowed them to vote on issues, but not for candidates. It was not until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment that women had full suffrage in Iowa. Although Iowa supported the Federal Equal Rights Amendment, in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution. Iowa added the word \"women\" to the Iowa Constitution in 1998. After the amendment, it reads: \"All men and women are, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights\u2014among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.\"In May 2018 Iowa signed into law one of the country's most restrictive abortion bans: the requirement that a doctor cannot perform an abortion if they can detect a fetal heartbeat, which in many cases would restrict abortions pregnancies less than six weeks old. It was struck down in January 2019, when an Iowa state judge ruled that the \"fetal heartbeat\" law was unconstitutional.\n\n\n==== LGBT rights ====\n\nThe state's law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976, 27 years before Lawrence v. Texas. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature added \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" to the protected classes listed in the Iowa Civil Rights Act.On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court decided Varnum v. Brien, holding in a unanimous decision, the state's law forbidding same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. This made Iowa the third state in the U.S. and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Arts ===\n\nThe Clint Eastwood movie The Bridges of Madison County, based on the popular novel of the same name, took place and was filmed in Madison County. What's Eating Gilbert Grape, based on the Peter Hedges novel of the same name, is set in the fictional Iowa town of Endora. Hedges was born in West Des Moines.Des Moines is home to members of the famous metal band Slipknot. The state is mentioned in the band's songs, and the album Iowa is named after the state.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe state has four major college teams playing in NCAA Division I for all sports. In football, Iowa State University and the University of Iowa compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), whereas the University of Northern Iowa and Drake University compete in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS).

It was the first appearance of the team event, which replaced the duet and solo events held previously. (The duet event would return four years later.)\nEight countries qualified for the Olympic Games at an Olympic qualifying event held in conjunction with the 1995 FINA Synchronized Swimming World Cup. Each team consisted of eight swimmers (chosen from a total team of ten). The competition included two events, the technical routine program and the free routine program.\nThe technical routine required entries to perform a series of required elements in prescribed order. It had a time limit of two minutes and 50 seconds. Music selection and choreography was up to the discretion of each team. In the free routine, there were no specifications for the routine other than the five-minute time limit. In both the technical and free routines, a panel of 10 judges (five giving scores for technical merit and five awarding scores for artistic impression) awarded points from 0 to 10 in one tenth point increments.\nWhen the technical merit and artistic impression scores were calculated for a total score, the technical routine score was weighted to 35 percent and the free routine to 65 percent. These two scores were then combined to determine overall medal placement.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nAll times are Beijing Standard Time UTC+8\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Olympic Report",
    "Steve Morrison (American football)": "Steven Craig Morrison (born December 28, 1971) is a retired professional American football linebacker who played for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 1998. He is currently the associate head coach/linebackers coach at Bowling Green Falcons football. He previously served as the linebackers coach for the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team, on the coaching staff at Western Michigan, and as the linebackers coach at Syracuse Orange football. Prior to these professional experiences, he had excelled in college football as an All-Big Ten Conference inside linebacker from 1990 to 1994 for the Michigan Wolverines, whom he served as captain.  In high school, he had been a Detroit Free Press first-team All-State (Michigan) and second-team All-Midwest selection in football and an All-American in lacrosse.\nAfter retiring from professional football as a player, he gained his first two years of coaching experience as the defensive coordinator for Michigan High School Athletic Association football champion Brother Rice High School (his high school alma mater). He then served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan for three years. He then assumed a role as an assistant at Western Michigan University. At Western Michigan, he has served as the linebacker coach after spending a year as the defensive line coach. The 2009 Western Michigan Broncos season marked Morrison's fifth season on the team's staff, his fourth as linebacker coach and his second as defensive coordinator.  He then went on to serve as the linebackers coach at Eastern Michigan and Syracuse. In 2019, he was hired as the associate head coach/ linebackers coach at Bowling Green State University.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nBarbara Morrison, Steve's mother, says Steve was read his last rites on the day of his birth because he had the same lung disease that Patrick Kennedy, the son of United States President John F. Kennedy, died from.  He was then put in an incubator where his mother could not touch him for 12 months.  Morrison wanted to be a linebacker because of the tenacity of the position. His favorite book was a book about Jack Lambert and Jack Ham and he grew up a Pittsburgh Steelers fan.  He played soccer when he was a youth.\n\n\n=== High school ===\n\nMorrison competed for Brother Rice High School of the Detroit, Michigan Catholic High School League.  As a junior who played both fullback and linebacker, he was sidelined for the remainder of the season with a knee injury in his third game, but the team went 7\u20132 for the season despite his injury.  As a senior, Morrison was part of a 1989 team that lost in the Class A semifinals 6\u20130 to Martin Luther King High School at Atwood Stadium.  The team had been ranked as the number three high school team in the Metro Detroit Area by the Detroit Free Press in its pre-season poll. Morrison had been hailed as a blue chip athlete entering his senior season in the same pre-season summary.  The team was 11\u20130 and the number one ranked area high school team prior to the loss.  Once, Morrison executed an 82-yard punt during a high school game.  During his senior season, his coach, Al Fracassa, was the Detroit Free Press Coach of the Year and Morrison was a First-Team All-Metro Detroit selection at linebacker.  However, fellow fullback/linebacker two-way Detroit area player Jerome Bettis was the first team fullback.  Both players earned first-team Detroit Free Press All-State honors.  However, a poll of 14 experts selected Bettis first-team all-Midwest (Big Ten States of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin because Penn State had not yet joined the conference), but only selected Morrison second-team all Midwest.  In high school, Morrison was an All-American in lacrosse, along with Brother Rice and Michigan football teammate Gannon Dudlar.  He was a Catholic High School League Hall of Fame athlete and was inducted in the 1995 Hall of Fame class that included Shawn Respert, among others.\n\n\n=== College ===\n\nAfter attending Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, his college decision eventually came down to a choice between Michigan and Michigan State University.  He was part of a highly touted Michigan recruiting class that was ranked fourth in the nation and that included five of the top twelve players in the state and seven of the top twelve regional players. He spent five years at the University of Michigan where he anchored the defense as an inside linebacker. In 1990, he was the first true freshman to start on defense since 1987. In his 1991 debut for Michigan against the Boston College Eagles, he opposed former Brother Rice teammate Pete Mitchell, who was appearing in his first game.  On Mitchell's first career catch, Morrison was warned for making a late hit against Mitchell.  A total of seven Brother Rice alumni played in the game.  He became a rare five-year varsity letter winner while wearing #36 for the Michigan Wolverines football program from 1990 to 1994,  He was mentored by 1991 Butkus Award winner Erick Anderson. He helped the 1990 three-peat Big Ten Conference Champions defend their title for a total of five consecutive conference championships ending in 1992.  The 1991 and 1992 teams went to the Rose Bowl. During the 1992 season, he replaced Anderson, who had led Michigan in tackles four consecutive seasons, as the defensive signal caller. He was named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week after making 15 tackles against Purdue Boilermakers on October 31, 1992. He was named the 1992 winner of The Roger Zatkoff Award as the team's best linebacker.\nHe became team captain in 1994 for coach Gary Moeller. On a team that had two All-Americans (Ty Law and Remy Hamilton), he was one of six All-Big Ten players (Law, Hamilton, Tyrone Wheatley, Amani Toomer and Jason Horn) and a Butkus Award semifinalist. Morrison earned his bachelor's degree in sports management and communications in 1994 from Michigan.At the time of his graduation, he ranked third in career tackles in school history, behind Anderson and Ron Simpkins. He has since been passed by Jarrett Irons and Sam Sword, and he stands fifth with 220 tackles. In terms of tackles and assists combined, Morrison once totaled 23 in a November 14, 1992 game against the Illinois Fighting Illini football team, which stands as a Michigan Football record for a game at Michigan Stadium. Morrison suffered compartmental syndrome in his calf, which necessitated surgical repair to stop internal bleeding, during his 1990 freshman season, for which he earned a medical redshirt season by the NCAA. As a sophomore (redshirt freshman), he sat out four games with a broken leg. In 1993, he missed the first seven games with a broken foot.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== NFL ===\nHe was not drafted in the 1995 NFL draft, but signed with the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent after the draft.  He played with the Colts from 1995 to 1998.  He accumulated 2 quarterback sacks, 2 interceptions, and 4 fumble recoveries.   Although the Colts best records during his tenure was 9\u20137 in both 1995 and 1996, the team made the playoffs twice and Morrison had a chance to play in an American Football Conference Championship game.  During the 1995\u20131996 NFL playoffs, the Colts won two playoff games on the road under Ted Marchibroda to reach the championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.  Despite the playoff success, they changed coaches, as Lindy Infante took them back to the 1996\u20131997 NFL playoffs with a 9\u20137 record, only to fall in the wild card game to the Steelers again.  Morrison started 31 games over the course of his career, including 29 regular season games.  In 1997 and 1998, the team had losing seasons, although Morrison started more games as his career progressed.  Morrison was signed by the Detroit Lions for the 1999 NFL season, but he was waived before the season started.\n\n\n=== Early coaching experience ===\nHe served as the defensive coordinator for his high school alma mater, Brother Rice Warriors, in 2000 and 2001.  In 2000, they won the Michigan High School Athletic Association Division 2 football championship.  He was a member of the coaching staff, when his high school coach Fracassa became the winningest coach in Michigan High School football history. From 2002 to 2004 he served in various capacities on the defensive coaching staff for the Michigan Wolverines. In 2002, he served as the video assistant.  In 2003, he became a graduate assistant/outside linebackers coach.\n\n\n=== Western Michigan (2005\u20132009) ===\nIn 2005, he took the Western Michigan defensive line coaching position on new head coach Bill Cubit's staff.  That same year, Scott Shafer assumed the defensive coordinator position at Western Michigan, and Morrison served under him.  Then, in 2006, Morrison assumed the linebacker coach position.  The defense immediately produced results: #1 in the country in interceptions, #1 in sacks per game, and a Mid-American Conference record rushing yards per game defense. In addition to the team numbers he fostered Ameer Ismail, the nation's leader in quarterback sacks and tackles for a loss.On March 12, 2008, after defensive coordinator Bill Miller left to be the Louisville Cardinals football linebacker coach, Western Michigan promoted Morrison to defensive coordinator, and he relinquished his recruiting coordinator role to tight ends coach Jake Moreland.  He continued to serve as the linebackers coach in 2008.  He converted the defensive scheme from a two-gap scheme to a one-gap scheme upon taking over as defensive coordinator.  His coaching style is considered a compromise between styles of the previous coordinators: the highly enthusiastic Shafer style and the laid back Miller style.  The 2008 Western Michigan Broncos football team compiled a 9\u20133 (6\u20132 conference) record earning them a trip to the 2008 Texas Bowl to face the Rice Owls.  His defense ranked toward the middle of the MAC.  Rice blew out Western Michigan by taking a 38\u20130 lead before allowing two late fourth quarter touchdowns for a 38\u201314 final score.  On the eve of the Bowl game, the Broncos signed head coach Cubit to a five-year extension and there was no indication he intended to make any changes in his staff.  Morrison's 2008 defense produced first-team All-MAC selection Louis Delmas, who appeared in the January 24, 2009 Senior Bowl and was the first safety chosen in the 2009 NFL Draft.  After a disappointing 2009 Western Michigan season in which WMU ranked 102 out of 120 Division I teams, Morrison was fired and replaced by former Hofstra coach Dave Cohen.\n\n\n=== Eastern Michigan (2010\u20132011) ===\nMorrison served as the linebackers coach for Eastern Michigan University under head coach Ron English and defensive coordinator Phil Snow. The 2010 Eagles posted a 2\u201310 record.\n\n\n=== Syracuse (2012\u20132013) ===\nIn January 2012, Steve Morrison joined the Syracuse Orangemen football team staff as the linebackers coach, reuniting with his former Western Michigan defensive coordinator, Scott Schafer, the defensive coordinator for the Syracuse Orangemen. He also joined former Michigan teammate Tyrone Wheatley on the coaching staff. In January 2013, Morrison left the team for \"personal reasons\".\n\n\n=== Bowling Green (2019\u2013) ===\nMorrison was hired by former Michigan teammate Scot Loeffler to be his associate head coach and linebackers coach for the Bowling Green Falcons football.\n\n\n== Family ==\nIn college, Morrison's family hosted various teammates such as Todd Collins at Christmas time.  This is part of a Michigan football tradition that when the team is playing late season Bowl games, the players from outside the Midwest spend Christmas Eve and Christmas Day morning with local families.  Morrison is married to former University of Michigan softball captain Mary Campana.  The couple had their third child on May 23, 2007. They now have three sons: Alexander (8-29-01), Marco (11-18-04) and Roman (5-23-07).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEastern Michigan profile\nSteve Morrison at NFL.com",

    "Blachernae": "Blachernae (Medieval Greek: \u0392\u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9) was a suburb in the northwestern section of Constantinople, the capital city of the Byzantine Empire. It is the site of a water source and a number of prominent churches were built there, most notably the great Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Panagia Blacherniotissa), built by Empress Pulcheria in c. 450, expanded by Emperor Leo I (r. 457\u2013474) and renovated by Emperor Justinian I (r. 527\u2013565) in the 6th century.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Romanian philologist Ilie Gherghel wrote a study about Blachernae and concluded that it possibly derived from the name of a Vlach (sometimes written as Blach or Blasi), who came to Constantinople from the lower Danube, a region named today Dobruja. Gherghel compared data from old historians like Genesios and from the Greek lexicon Suidas and mentioned the existence of a small colony of Vlachs in the area of today Blachernae. Similar opinions were sustained by Lisseanu. The name Blachernae appeared in a work of Theophanes the Confessor in connection with a revolt of Flavius Vitalianus against Emperor Anastasius I in 513.According to Ilie Gherghel, the word vlach became known in the Germanic and Slavic world through the Vikings that came in contact with the Byzantine Empire. The byzantine origin of the word vlach is supported by the historian Stelian Brezeanu who considers that one of the first accounts about Romanians south of the Danube, referred to by the name vlachorynchini (the vlachs near the Rynchos river), is present in a historical account about the Kastamonitou Monastery which was written in the 17th century but based on a 9th century byzantine source.\n\n\n== Byzantine era ==\nThe quarter is recorded as regio XIV in the early 5th-century Notitia Urbis Constantinopolitanae, where it is recorded as being enclosed by a wall of its own. The quarter was connected to the city proper at the construction of the Theodosian Walls, but the Church of St. Mary remained outside of the walls until 627, when Emperor Heraclius (r. 610\u2013641) built another wall to enclose it. By that time, the church had become the major Marian shrine of the city, and the second-most important church in Constantinople after Hagia Sophia, if only because the emperors' residence was nearby. In 1347, Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347\u20131354) was crowned there, instead of at Hagia Sophia.\nSouth of the church and situated on the city's Seventh Hill stood the imperial Palace of Blachernae, which was first erected in c. 500. During the Komnenian period, it became the favourite imperial residence, eclipsing the older Great Palace of Constantinople on the eastern end of the city. Although the Latin emperors returned to the Bucoleon Palace, the Palaiologos emperors of the restored Byzantine Empire again used the Blachernae Palace as their main residence. The Palace of the Porphyrogenitus (Turkish: Tekfur Saray\u0131) and the so-called Prison of Anemas are the main surviving structures of the Palace of Blachernae, which was a complex of multiple buildings.\nFollowing the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in May 1453, the Sultan's residence was moved to Topkap\u0131 Palace on the site of the ancient acropolis of Byzantium, opposite to the original site of the Great Palace, which had by this time fallen into complete ruin, and the Blachernae area (with the exception of the Palace of Porphyrogenitus) fell into disuse.\nDuring the Byzantine Papacy, the portion of the Aventine overlooking the Greek quarter of Rome became known as the ad Balcernas or Blachernas.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe historic Blachernae area is in the present-day Istanbul quarter known as Ayvansaray. The sacred spring, associated with the Virgin Mary, can still be visited today; in Turkish it is named Ayazma, a name derived from the Greek term hagiasma (Greek: \u1f01\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1), meaning \"holy water\".\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtik Mustafa Pasha Mosque\nBlachernitissa\nBlanquerna\nThe Protection of the Mother of God\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGherghel, Ilie (1920).

    "I-205 busway": "The I-205 busway was a partially built busway along the right-of-way of the Interstate 205 freeway in Portland, Oregon.  Although it never opened as a busway, its right-of-way has been in use by light rail lines partially since 2001 and fully since 2009.\nThe transitway, which was physically separate from the parallel freeway lanes, was planned in the mid- and late 1970s as part of the final segment of I-205.  Only a graded route with several entrance ramps and two underpass tunnels under I-205 were built.  No bridges or overpasses were built until later adaptation for use by MAX Light Rail trains.\nThe transitway's right-of-way started in the median of I-205 near Portland International Airport and ran south to the junction of I-205 & I-84, where it continued through an underpass under the northbound lanes of I-205. From here it followed the freeway's east embankment to just south of Market Street, where it once again entered a tunnel taking it under the freeway. This tunnel took the right-of-way underneath all lanes (both directions) of  I-205, surfacing west of the freeway's southbound lanes at a point just north of Division Street. From there, it continued south along the west side of I-205 to SE Foster Road, where it ended. The entire transitway has now been adapted for use by TriMet light rail trains.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1970s, Multnomah County officials negotiated a number of improvements to the proposed I-205 freeway with the Oregon Department of Transportation in order to win their support.  Among them was the transitway, a bike path and reconfigured interchanges.  The transitway was intended to connect at Gateway into the proposed Banfield Transitway, which originally was to have been a busway and would have run along I-84 to the Lloyd District and Downtown.\nBy the late 1970s, light rail became the selected transit mode in the Banfield corridor and opened in 1986 as Portland's first light rail line (now a portion of the Blue Line).  When light rail was selected over the busway option in the Banfield corridor, the fate of the proposed I-205 busway was sealed, although the corridor was, since the late 1970s, considered a potential future light rail line.\nThe Blue Line uses a short portion of the transitway between the Gateway station and Burnside Street, opened in 1986. The portion of the route north from Gateway opened in September 2001 as the Red Line. The portion south from Burnside (and beyond to the Clackamas Town Center) opened in September 2009 as the Green Line.\n\n\n== Stations ==\nNames of possible stations, as originally proposed in the 1970s, with corresponding later developments:\n\nSandy-Columbia became the Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center station on the Red Line\nGateway became the Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center station on the Blue, Green and Red lines\nMall 205 became the Southeast Main Street station on the Green Line\nDivision became Southeast Division Street station on the Green Line\nPowell became Southeast Powell Boulevard station on the Green Line\nHolgate became Southeast Holgate Boulevard station on the Green Line\nLents became Lents Town Center/Southeast Foster Road station on the Green Line\n\n\n== See also ==\nMount Hood Freeway\nI-205 Bike Path\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMap: 45.50667\u00b0N 122.56611\u00b0W\ufeff / 45.50667; -122.56611",

    "Budelse Brouwerij": "The Budelse Brouwerij is a Dutch brewery in Budel, North Brabant. \n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe brewery was founded in 1870 as Brewery De Hoop. In the 1960s, the name of the brewery was changed to Budelse Brouwerij. Founder Gerardus Arts came from Oss, and had learned brewing at the Snieders family (later Dommelsch Brewery) in Dommelen, and at brewery De Kroon in Oirschot. In 1870 he had married Anna Maria Maas. The Maas family provided the funding for the small brewery.\nIn 1879 the railroad Iron Rhine was finished, and a railway station was opened in Budel-Schoot. Gerard Arts opened a hotel named Brouwershuis. Meanwhile Budel expanded and a zinc smelting factory was founded. At the time De Hoop competed with the older brewery of the Rutten family, who were very influential in Budel. In 1899 a third brewery was founded by A.J. de Winkel, later led by Nelissen.\n\n\n=== Early twentieth century ===\nThe invention of Pilsner beer in 1842 would radically change the beer market. Producing Pilsner in the Netherlands required artificial refrigeration. From about 1870, the first steam powered pilsner breweries were founded in the Netherlands. At the time, brewing pilsner required so much capital, that small breweries like Budels could not compete on that market. Meanwhile the public moved towards the new industrial beers.\nDuring World War I a shortage of commodities would spell the end for many small Dutch brewers. Both the Rutten brewery, and the Nelissen brewery closed down in 1917. In 1921 Budels started to mechanize its production. In 1922 the brewery also started to produce Lemonade, using the label Favoriet. The really significant investments took place in the 1930s, when most local competitors had disappeared.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\nThe Budelse Brouwerij was one of the few breweries which survived the rigorous concentration in the Dutch beer market after World War II. In 1945 there were 80 breweries left in the Netherlands. In 1950 there were 58 breweries left in the Netherlands. By 1968 there were only 20 Dutch breweries left. In 1975 the number was 13.Meanwhile, the pilsner part of the beer market had increased from just over 50% before the war to almost 99% in 1980. The average consumption of beer increased from 10.1 liter just after the war to 89.1 liter per capita in 1981.\n\n\n== Budelse Brouwerij today ==\nThe 1980s were the time that the Dutch public started to look for something different, whether this was traditional beer, or foreign beers. Up till the mid-1980s the Budelse Brouwerij brewery made Pilsner, 'sweetened Oud bruin' (not to be confused with Oud Bruin), and Bock. It then expanded its portfolio with Capucijn abdijbier (warm fermentation), Altbier and introduced the name Parel for some specialty beers.Brewing eco-friendly beer is a specialization of Budelse Brouwerij. The brewery was ahead of its time when it started on this market in the 1990s.In 2009 Budelse Brouwerij was one of the country's largest microbreweries.\n\n\n== References ==\nMcFarland, Ben (2009), World's Best Beers: One Thousand Craft Brews from Cask to Glass, Sterling, ISBN 9781402766947\nWols, Rien (2011), Budelse Brouwerij, BHIC\n\n\n== Notes ==",

    "Sasyk Lagoon": "Sasyk, or Kunduk (Ukrainian: \u0421\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043a, \u041a\u0443\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043a - transcribed as previous, Romanian: Limanul Sasic, Conduc, Turkish: Sas\u0131k G\u00f6l\u00fc, Kunduk G\u00f6l\u00fc), is a lagoon or liman in southern Ukraine, near the Danube Delta. It is a Ramsar listed wetland site important for migrating, breeding and moulting birds. About 25,000 pairs of wetland birds make their nests there and seasonal conglomerations of birds are up to 100,000 individuals.The area of the lagoon is 215 km2, and the depth up to 3.3 m. Until 1978 the lagoon was separated into two parts: northern brackishwater area, including the rivers Cog\u00e2lnic and Sarata, and a southern marine area. The lagoon was separated from the sea by a 0.5 km wide sandbar.\n\n\n== Dam and reduced salinity ==\nIn 1978 a concrete dam was built on the sandbar and the lagoon was connected to the Danube River by a canal, through which fresh flood waters come. This has adversely changed the salinity in the lake, and this plus disturbances from recreation and commercial fishing activities have influenced the habitat for wildfowl.The aim of this Soviet dam project was to convert the lagoon to a fresh water lake to use for irrigation. However, this failed and the use of water from Sasyk resulted in the salinization of about 30,000 hectares of land, with associated detrimental impact on crops, and mineralization of ground water and wells. The project ended in ecological, social and economic disaster.A 2007 report stated that the lagoon had become too dangerous for swimming because of pollution, including pesticides and heavy metals. The water is described as greenish with an unpleasant smell. Many now favour breaking the dam and reconnecting the lagoon with the sea.\n\n\n== Notes and references ==",
    "Chinese typewriter": "A Chinese typewriter is a typewriter that can type Chinese script. Early European typewriters began appearing in the early 19th century. However, as the Chinese language uses a logographic writing system, fitting thousands of Chinese characters on the machine needed much more complex engineering than typewriters using a simple Latin alphabet, or other non-logographic scripts. An ordinary Chinese printing office uses 6,000 Chinese characters. Chinese typewriters, and similar Japanese typewriters invented by Kyota Sugimoto, which use kanji adopted from the Chinese writing system, started to appear only in the early 20th century. There have been at least five dozen versions of Chinese typewriters, ranging from sizable mechanical models to sophisticated electric word processors.\n\n\n== Hou-Kun Chow Tong-Zhi typewriter ==\n\nHou-Kun Chow (Chinese: \u5468\u539a\u5764), a mechanical engineer in Shanghai, is credited with inventing the first Chinese typewriter in 1916. His typewriter typed 4,000 characters. He had studied in the United States like several other Chinese who also contributed to the development of Chinese typewriters. Chow first thought about the practicality of a Chinese typewriter in Boston, while he was inspecting American typewriters as a student of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His efforts were initially hindered by a lack of technical assistance in Shanghai.Chow considered it impossible to build a Chinese typewriter with a separate key for each Chinese character. Instead, his design used a revolving cylinder containing the characters.  They were ordered by radicals and number of strokes on the cylinder, like a  Chinese dictionary. This design however proved heavy, the machine initially weighing  40 pounds (18 kg) and an improved version about 30 pounds (14 kg).Chow expected his typewriter to be used in Chinese offices where multiple copies of documents would have to be made, and by Chinese living in foreign countries without access to skilled writers of Chinese.\n\n\n== IBM's Electric Chinese Typewriter ==\nOn June 28, 1944, Kao Chung-Chin, an inventor at IBM, filed for a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and on December 17, 1946 was issued patent number 2412777A for his invention. Chung-Chin's typewriter employed 36 keys, divided across four banks. The first bank had six keys numbered 0 through 5, and the three other banks each had 10 keys numbered 0 through 9. In order to type a character, the operator was required to simultaneously select one key from each of the four banks. Each of those four-digit combinations corresponded to one of 5,400 Chinese characters, or other symbols such as punctuation marks, which were etched onto the surface of a revolving drum inside the typewriter. The drum had a diameter of 7 inches, a length of 11 inches, and made a complete revolution once per second, allowing for the operator to achieve a maximum typing speed of 45 words per minute.\n\n\n== Wanneng and Double Pigeon typewriters ==\nChinese typewriters made in Japan entered the market in the 1920s, with the Wanneng (Chinese: \u4e07\u80fd; pinyin: W\u00e0nn\u00e9ng) brand, introduced by the Nippon Typewriter Company in 1940 during the Second Sino-Japanese War, becoming the de facto standard.  After Japan's defeat and the subsequent nationalization of typewriter companies by the Communist government, locally made models based on the Wanneng continued to dominate the market, particularly the Double Pigeon (Chinese: \u53cc\u9e3d; pinyin: Shu\u0101ngg\u0113).\n\n\n== Ming Kwai typewriter ==\n\nThe Ming Kwai typewriter is an electromechanical typewriter invented and patented by Lin Yutang. The patent, No. 2613795, was filed on April 17, 1946 by Lin, and was issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office on October 14, 1952. One of Lin's intentions was to help modernize China. Lin called his design the \"Ming Kwai\" typewriter and promoted it as \"The Only Chinese Typewriter Designed for Everybody's Use\". The two Chinese characters \"Ming kwai\" (Chinese: \u660e\u5feb; pinyin: m\u00edngku\u00e0i; Wade\u2013Giles: ming-k'uai) means \"clear\" (as in understandable) and \"quick\".\nLin had a prototype machine custom built by the Carl E. Krum Company, a small engineering-design consulting firm with an office in New York City. That multilingual typewriter was the size of a conventional office typewriter of the 1940s. It measured 36 cm \u00d7 46 cm \u00d7 23 cm (14.2 in \u00d7 18.1 in \u00d7 9.1 in). The typefaces fit on a drum. A \"magic eye\" was mounted in the center of the keyboard which magnifies and allows the typist to review a selected character. Characters are selected by first pressing two keys to choose a desired character which is arranged according to a system Lin devised for his dictionary of the Chinese language. The selected Chinese character appeared in the magic eye for preview, the typist then pressed a \"master\" key, similar to today's computer function key. The typewriter could create 90,000 distinct characters using either one or two of six character-containing rollers, which in combination has 7000 full characters and 1,400 character radicals or partial characters.The inspired aspect of the typewriter was the system Lin devised for a Chinese script. It had thirty geometric shapes or strokes (somewhat analogous to the elements of a glyph). These became \"letters\" by which to alphabetize Chinese characters. He broke tradition with the long-standing system of radicals and stroke order writing and categorizing of Chinese characters, inventing a new way of seeing and categorizing.\nThe typewriter was not produced commercially. According to Lin's daughter, Lin Tai-Yi, the day she was to demonstrate the machine to executives of the Remington Typewriter Company, they could not make it work. Although they did get the machine fixed for a press conference the next day, it was to no avail. Lin found himself deeply in debt. In 1947, Lin paid income taxes owed to the Internal Revenue Service and went to work in Paris for UNESCO.\n\n\n== Cultural and technological impact ==\nBetween the 1930s and 1950s, Chinese typewriters had a political implication, as they were used in mass-production of leaflets and pamphlets. The typewriters also gained popular appeal and changed Chinese office work.According to Thomas Mullaney, it is possible that development of modern Chinese typewriters in the 1960s and 1970s influenced the development of modern computer word processors and even affected the development of computers themselves. In the 1950s, typists came to rearrange the character layout from the standard dictionary layout to groups of common words and phrases.  Chinese typewriter engineers were trying to make the most common characters be accessible at the fastest speed possible by word prediction, a technique used today in Chinese input methods for computers, as well as in text messaging in many languages. This arrangement was called the lianxiang (\u201cconnected thought\u201d) layout, similar to predictive text and sped typing speeds from about 20 words per minute to around 80.Chinese typewriter has become a metaphor for absurdity, complexity and backwardness in Western popular culture. One such example is MC Hammer's dance move named after the Chinese typewriter in the music video for \"U Can't Touch This\". The move, with its fast paced and large gestures, supposedly resembles a person working on a huge, complex typewriter.The Chinese typewriter was ultimately eclipsed and made redundant with the introduction of computerised word processing, pioneered by engineer and dissident Wan Runnan and his partners when they formed Stone Emerging Industries Company (Chinese: \u56db\u901a\u65b0\u578b\u4ea7\u4e1a\u516c\u53f8; pinyin: S\u00ect\u014dng x\u012bnx\u00edng ch\u00e1ny\u00e8 g\u014dngs\u012b) in 1984 in Zhongguancun, China's \"Silicon Valley\".  The last Chinese typewriters were completed around 1991. Stone developed software based on Alps Electric custom made 8088 based hardware with a Brother Industries dot matrix printer, distributed by Mitsui, to print Chinese characters and released the system as the MS-2400.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Articles ===\n1 Billion People. 100,000 Characters. 1 Typewriter.The machine that changed a language forever.

Over time Hatsuichi and the local Ebisu Shrine joined in creating the modern festival.  Ebisu is a god of business and one of the seven \"lucky gods\" derived from China. The Ebisu Shrine is decorated with lanterns, traditional ornaments and colors for the festival, which now marks the annual opening of the shrine. On the afternoon of Hatsuichi a portable shrine is paraded through the town.\nIn July, the neighboring town of Oyodo hosts the Yoshino-gawa festival, which includes a fireworks display.\nIn early October, the town holds a sports festival in honor of Japan's national Health and Sports Day. An opening ceremony including fireworks and the lighting of an Olympic-style torch takes place as neighborhoods compete in various games. Prizes are awarded on the neighborhood and town level, and may include items such as bags of rice, bicycles, toaster ovens, heaters, tissues, beer, game systems, and various household items. The town's schools also participate in the event with various dances and performances.\nThe Aki Matsuri (Fall or Autumn Festival) is held in mid- to late October. Activities include a parade of lanterns and drums down the main street to one of the town's temples near the top of a mountain.

A younger son, he was adopted at an early age by Suzuki Jiko, a Buddhist prelate in Kawasaki, and received the Suzuki surname.\n\nHe was a graduate of the law school of Tokyo Imperial University in 1891.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSuzuki entered the Ministry of Justice in 1891 as a judge.:\u200a57\u200a In 1893, he became a judge at the Tokyo District Court then its Chief Judge in 1907 and subsequently was promoted to the Tokyo Court of Appeals, and finally to the Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan, where he was noted for his quick judgments. He then served as Chief of the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Justice Ministry, Vice Justice Minister, and Public Prosecutor General ) in 1921.Suzuki\u2019s political career began in 1920, when he was appointed to the House of Peers. In 1924, he was selected as Justice Minister in the cabinet of Kiyoura Keigo. During this period, he lent aid to and was \"very active\" in the Kokuhonsha, a nationalist organization founded by Kiichir\u014d Hiranuma \"to combat the spread of liberal and foreign ideas\". Following the collapse of the Kiyoura administration in 1926, Suzuki joined the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai. The following year, he joined the administration of Tanaka Giichi as Home Minister. While Home Minister, he strengthened the Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu and enforcement of the stricter Peace Preservation Laws, and took an uncompromisingly harsh position against activities by the outlawed Japan Communist Party, culminating in the March 15 incident which involved the arrest of hundreds of known party members and suspected party sympathizers. He also used his position as Home Minister to replace 17 prefectural governors with Rikken Seiy\u016bkai members, as well as showing favoritism to promotions within the Ministry itself towards party members. These actions led to his forced resignation in 1928 after charges were made this constituted illegal interference with the 1928 General Election.\nSuzuki returned to the Diet of Japan in the 1932 General Election, when he was elected to the House of Representatives from the Kanagawa 2nd district. He returned to the cabinet as Justice Minister from 1931-1932 and as Home Minister from 1932-1933 under the Inukai administration. On Inukai\u2019s assassination in the May 15 incident, Suzuki became president of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai. However, despite holding a majority of the seats in the Diet of Japan, Suzuki was not selected to become Prime Minister, largely due to a long-standing enmity with the last genr\u014d Saionji Kinmochi, who favored Admiral Sait\u014d Makoto for the post. After Sait\u014d\u2019s resignation in 1934, Suzuki was again sidelined, and the office of Prime Minister went to Okada Keisuke.\nFollowing losses in the 1936 General Election, Suzuki no longer had a seat in the Diet.:\u200a227\u200a Pressured to resign as head of the Rikken Seiy\u016bkai, he held onto the post until 1937 as part of a collective leadership.\nAdditionally, Suzuki taught criminal law at Waseda University.:\u200a58\u200a\n\n\n== Personal life and demise ==\nSuzuki was married to Kazuka Hatoyama, daughter of Kazuo Hatoyama,:\u200a58\u200a :\u200a57\u200a head of the political Hatoyama family.\nSuzuki died in 1940, and his grave is at the Yanaka Cemetery in Tokyo.\n\n\n== References ==\nDuss, Peter (1990).

As the father, Ramon is absolutely convinced that it is only his will that must be obeyed by all the members of his family. His rigidity provoked a miniature revolt among his children. Tony, a character vaguely described in the story was the first to express his outrage against the severity of the condition. He decided to leave and settle in the United States. As a result, his father considers him no longer as his son and forbids his name to be mentioned in the house.\nAct one started with the obvious abhorrence expressed by the children by seeking an explanation from their mother why they were treated as if they were irresponsible adults devoid of judgment. All the children felt their existences were restricted within the confines of their house. Encarna (the mother) reasoned with the children, telling them that their father knew what is best for them and was simply protecting them from the wickedness of the outside world. The comfort and luxury of the house, she insisted, should be good enough to spend their extra time. The children thought otherwise and demanded their mother to persuade their father to grant them more freedom and to live life without his lingering presence.\nThe argument the children had with their mother was an overture to the coming tragedy. The children were all resigned that their fate was solely controlled by their father and only through radical actions that they can recover and ultimately discover themselves.\n\n\n=== Climax ===\nThe succeeding scenes were crafted to depict the intense yearning of the children to get away from the commanding presence of their father. Adeling decided to abandon her family together with Jethro Jake. The consequence of her act produced a more rigorous control from the father allowing the rest of the children to increase their sufferings. When Adeling left, Clemencia was utterly distressed and got sick with anemia. Jorge on the other hand was reprimanded by his father when his teacher, Prof. Sarte, informed his father that he stole money (forty pesos) from his class fund. Both Flavio and Gonzalo had brought home their own version of troubles; the latter was infected with syphilis from an unrespectable woman and Flavio was shot and killed during a fight in a cabaret. After witnessing all these painful episodes in the family, Clemencia finally retired and in a peculiar way somehow liberated herself from her father's tyranny.\nBefore all these events took place, Tio Carlos was constantly reminding Ramon that the children felt intense suffocation the way how things transpire in the house. Carlos tried to deliver the message to Ramon, even questioning the way how he rears his children and insisted that a different method is necessary to let the children experience life. Carlos argued that the reason why his children were acting strangely was primarily because they can no longer endure excess repressions. But his warning was plainly ignored and Ramon responded by further suppressing the will of his children. Tia Pelagia was another person who showed affection and to whom the children expressed their emotions and disgust.\n\n\n=== Turning point ===\nRamon realized that the events that happened in the family proved that his ways were complete disaster. He felt absolute resignation and defeat; he had created hell inside his house that ruined the lives of his children.\n\n\n=== Falling action ===\nAfter recognizing his defeat, Ramon decided let go of his children and allowed them to make decisions for themselves. He finally gave Teresita his blessing to enter the convent and dedicate herself to God. Jorge was given permission to leave the house and find his own way. He also reconciled himself and admitted that Adeling had found her new home in the warm embrace of Jethro Jake.\n\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nRamon Sampang made peace with his sick son Gonzalo, the only child left after all the rest decided to abandon the house. He showed his remorse by giving joy to his son by inviting him son to spend sometime in their country house in Sibul.\n\n\n== Theme ==\nThe play revealed the dominance of male in the Filipino family. Though there were several female characters, the characters of Ramon and Carlos were imposing. The mother was projected as weak and somebody who readily submits to the will of her husband. The children though abhor the situation they still showed astounding reverence to their father which is customarily expected from Filipino children.\n\n\n== Productions ==\nThe play was first staged by the Filipino Players under the author's direction at the Manila Grand Opera House on February 27, 1940.\nDulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP), the official performing group of the University of the Philippines, in celebration of Wilfrido Ma.

    "Blended wing body": "A blended wing body (BWB), also known as blended body or hybrid wing body (HWB), is a fixed-wing aircraft having no clear dividing line between the wings and the main body of the craft. The aircraft has distinct wing and body structures, which are smoothly blended together with no clear dividing line. This contrasts with a flying wing, which has no distinct fuselage, and a lifting body, which has no distinct wings. A BWB design may or may not be tailless.\nThe main advantage of the BWB is to reduce wetted area and the accompanying form drag associated with a conventional wing-body junction. It may also be given a wide airfoil-shaped body, allowing the entire craft to generate lift and thus reducing the size and drag of the wings.\nThe BWB configuration is used for both aircraft and underwater gliders.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early 1920s Nicolas Woyevodsky developed a theory of the BWB and, following wind tunnel tests, the Westland Dreadnought was built. It stalled on its first flight in 1924, severely injuring the pilot, and the project was cancelled. The idea was proposed again in the early 1940s for a Miles M.26 airliner project and the Miles M.30 \"X Minor\" research prototype was built to investigate it. The McDonnell XP-67 prototype interceptor also flew in 1944 but did not meet expectations.\nNASA returned to the concept in the 1990s with an artificially stabilized 17-foot (5.2 m) model (6% scale) called BWB-17, built by Stanford University, which was flown in 1997 and showed good handling qualities.:\u200a16\u200a From 2000 NASA went on to develop a remotely controlled research model with a 21-foot (6.4 m) wingspan.\nNASA has also jointly explored BWB designs for the Boeing X-48 unmanned aerial vehicle. Studies suggested that a BWB airliner carrying from 450 to 800 passengers could achieve fuel savings of over 20 percent.:\u200a21\u200aAirbus is studying a BWB design as a possible replacement for the A320neo family. A sub-scale model flew for the first time in June 2019 as part of the MAVERIC (Model Aircraft for Validation and Experimentation of Robust Innovative Controls) programme, which Airbus hopes will help it reduce CO2 emissions by up to 50% relative to 2005 levels.The N3-X NASA concept uses a number of superconducting electric motors to drive the distributed fans to lower the fuel burn, emissions, and noise. The power to drive these electric fans is generated by two wing-tip mounted gas-turbine-driven superconducting electric generators. This idea for a possible future aircraft is called a \"hybrid wing body\" or sometimes a blended wing body. In this design, the wing blends seamlessly into the body of the aircraft, which makes it extremely aerodynamic and holds great promise for dramatic reductions in fuel consumption, noise and emissions. NASA develops concepts like these to test in computer simulations and as models in wind tunnels to prove whether the possible benefits would actually occur.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe wide interior spaces created by the blending pose novel structural challenges. NASA has been studying foam-clad stitched-fabric carbon fiber composite skinning to create uninterrupted cabin space.The BWB form minimises the total wetted area - the surface area of the aircraft skin, thus reducing skin drag to a minimum. It also creates a thickening of the wing root area, allowing a more efficient structure and reduced weight compared to a conventional craft. NASA also plans to integrate Ultra High Bypass (UHB) ratio jet engines with the hybrid wing body.A conventional tubular fuselage carries 12-13% of the total lift compared to 31-43% carried by the centerbody in a BWB, where an intermediate lifting-fuselage configuration better suited to narrowbody sized airliners would carry 25-32% for a 6.1% - 8.2% increase in fuel efficiency.\n\n\n=== Potential advantages ===\nSignificant payload advantages in strategic airlift, air freight, and aerial refueling roles\nIncreased fuel efficiency \u2013 10.9% better than a conventional widebody, to over 20% than a comparable conventional aircraft.\nLower noise \u2013 NASA audio simulations show a 15dB reduction of Boeing 777-class aircraft, while other studies show 22\u201342 dB reduction below Stage 4 level, depending on configuration.\n\n\n=== Potential disadvantages ===\nEvacuating a BWB in an emergency could be a challenge. Because of the aircraft's shape, the seating layout would be theatre-style instead of tubular. This imposes inherent limits on the number of exit doors.\nIt has been suggested that BWB interiors would be windowless, more recent information shows that windows may be positioned differently but involve the same weight penalties as a conventional aircraft.\nIt has been suggested that passengers at the edges of the cabin may feel uncomfortable during wing roll however, passengers in large conventional aircraft like the 777 are equally susceptible to dutch roll.\nThe centre wingbox needs to be tall to be used as a passenger cabin, requiring a larger wing span to balance out.\nA BWB has more empty weight for a given payload, and may not be economical for short missions of around four or fewer hours.\nA larger wing span may be incompatible with some airport infrastructure, requiring folding wings similar to the Boeing777X.\nIt is more expensive to modify the design to create differently-sized variants compared to a conventional fuselage and wing which can be stretched or shrunk easily.\n\n\n== List of blended wing body aircraft ==\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Popular Science concept art ===\n\nA concept photo of a blended wing body commercial aircraft appeared in the November 2003 issue of Popular Science magazine.  Artists Neill Blomkamp and Simon van de Lagemaat from The Embassy Visual Effects created the photo for the magazine using computer graphics software to depict the future of aviation and air travel. In 2006 the image was used in an email hoax claiming that Boeing had developed a 1000-passenger jetliner (the \"Boeing 797\") with a \"radical Blended Wing design\" and Boeing refuted the claim.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAurora D8\nFlying-V jet\nList of flying wings\nLifting body\nSilent Aircraft Initiative, a BWB study\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAl Bowers (Sep 16, 2000). \"Blended-wing-body: Design challenges for the 21st century\".

    "USS Capella (AK-13)": "USS Capella (AK-13) was a cargo ship in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Capella, the star.\n\n\n== Built in Pennsylvania ==\nCapella was built in 1920 as Comerant by American International Shipbuilding Corporation, Hog Island, Pennsylvania, under a Shipping Board contract; acquired by the Navy 20 November 1921; and commissioned 8 December 1921, Lieutenant Commander S. W. Hickey, USNRF, in command.\n\n\n== Relief supplies to Japan ==\nCapella arrived at San Diego, California, 19 March 1922 to carry cargo along the west coast until July, when she returned to the east coast for similar duty in the next 4 months. Back in California waters in November, Capella sailed to Japan in October 1923 to bring food and medical supplies, donated by American citizens, as well as water for the relief of earthquake-desolated Yokohama.\n\n\n== Placed in reserve ==\nThe cargo ship resumed west coast operations until February 1924 when she returned to Norfolk, Virginia. Capella was decommissioned and placed in reserve there 1 September 1924. She was recommissioned 10 November 1938, and resumed supply runs along the east and west coast in alternate periods, on occasion penetrating Alaskan waters.\n\n\n== Pre-WWII and WWII service ==\nDuring July and August 1940 Capella assisted in the tow of the Navy's 10,700 ton New Orleans floating drydock from Balboa, Panama Canal Zone to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.  Capella and USS Navajo (AT-64) conducted an in-line, tandem tow with logistics support from USS Platte (AO-24).  The duration of the operation was 44 days and covered 4,771 nautical miles at an average speed of 4.5 knots.As war threatened and the United States began the buildup of Western Hemisphere bases acquired from the British, Capella was recalled to the east coast late in September 1940. The veteran cargo ship supported bases from the Panama Canal Zone to Newfoundland with cargoes brought from Atlantic ports until 1944. In June she cleared on the first of four transatlantic convoy crossings to Scotland, and North and West Africa, all so safely guarded as to be made without incident.\nOn 9 April 1942, Capella was hit by a friendly torpedo fired from PT-59, causing eight injuries, but no deaths.\n\n\n== Post WWII and decommissioning ==\nCapella returned to Caribbean cargo duty in June 1945, and on 30 November 1945 was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia.

    "Tang Dynasty City": "The Tang dynasty (, [t\u02b0\u01ce\u014b]; Chinese: \u5510\u671d), or Tang Empire, was an  imperial dynasty of China that ruled from 618 to 907 AD, with an interregnum between 690 and 705. It was preceded by the Sui dynasty and followed by the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a golden age of cosmopolitan culture. Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the Han dynasty.\nThe L\u01d0 family (\u674e) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire and inaugurating a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule. The dynasty was formally interrupted during 690\u2013705 when Empress Wu Zetian seized the throne, proclaiming the Wu Zhou dynasty and becoming the only legitimate Chinese empress regnant. The devastating An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763) shook the nation and led to the decline of central authority in the dynasty's latter half. Like the previous Sui dynasty, the Tang maintained a civil-service system by recruiting scholar-officials through standardized examinations and recommendations to office. The rise of regional military governors known as jiedushi during the 9th century undermined this civil order. The dynasty and central government went into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in mass population loss and displacement, widespread poverty, and further government dysfunction that ultimately ended the dynasty in 907.\nThe Tang capital at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) was then the world's most populous city. Two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries estimated the empire's population at about 50 million people, which grew to an estimated 80 million by the dynasty's end. From its numerous subjects, the dynasty raised professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers for control of Inner Asia and the lucrative trade-routes along the Silk Road. Far-flung kingdoms and states paid tribute to the Tang court, while the Tang also indirectly controlled several regions through a protectorate system. In addition to its political hegemony, the Tang exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring East Asian nations such as Japan and Korea. Chinese culture flourished and further matured during the Tang era. It is traditionally considered the greatest age for Chinese poetry. Two of China's most famous poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, belonged to this age, contributing with poets such as Wang Wei to the monumental Three Hundred Tang Poems. Many famous painters such as Han Gan, Zhang Xuan, and Zhou Fang were active, while Chinese court music flourished with instruments such as the popular pipa. Tang scholars compiled a rich variety of historical literature, as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. Notable innovations included the development of woodblock printing. Buddhism became a major influence in Chinese culture, with native Chinese sects gaining prominence. However, in the 840s Emperor Wuzong enacted policies to suppress Buddhism, which subsequently declined in influence.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment ===\n\nThe Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty, and claimed to be paternally descended from the Taoist founder, Lao Tzu (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er), the Han dynasty General Li Guang and founder of Han Chinese kingdom Western Liang ruler Li Gao.  This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; \u96b4\u897f\u674e\u6c0f), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had part-Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu.Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin.  Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18 years old, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges.  Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573\u2013621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621.  In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626.  Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne.  He is conventionally known by his temple name Taizong.Although killing two brothers and deposing his father contradicted the Confucian value of filial piety, Taizong showed himself to be a capable leader who listened to the advice of the wisest members of his council.  In 628, Emperor Taizong held a Buddhist memorial service for the casualties of war, and in 629 he had Buddhist monasteries erected at the sites of major battles so that monks could pray for the fallen on both sides of the fight.During the Tang campaign against the Eastern Turks, the Eastern Turkic Khaganate was destroyed after the capture of its ruler, Illig Qaghan by the famed Tang military officer Li Jing (571\u2013649); who later became a Chancellor of the Tang dynasty. With this victory, the Turks accepted Taizong as their khagan, a title rendered as Tian Kehan in addition to his rule as emperor of China under the traditional title \"Son of Heaven\". Taizong was succeeded by his son Li Zhi (as Emperor Gaozong) in 649 CE.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty further led the Tang campaigns against the Western Turks. Early military conflicts were a result of the Tang interventions in the rivalry between the Western and Eastern Turks in order to weaken both. Under Emperor Taizong, campaigns were dispatched in the Western Regions against Gaochang in 640, Karasahr in 644 and 648, and Kucha in 648. The wars against the Western Turks continued under Emperor Gaozong, and the Western Turkic Khaganate was finally annexed after General Su Dingfang's defeat of Qaghan Ashina Helu in 657 CE.\n\n\n=== Wu Zetian's usurpation ===\n\nAlthough she entered Emperor Gaozong's court as the lowly consort, Wu Zetian rose to the highest seat of power in 690, establishing the short-lived Wu Zhou.  Empress Wu's rise to power was achieved through cruel and calculating tactics: a popular conspiracy theory stated that she killed her own baby girl and blamed it on Gaozong's empress so that the empress would be demoted.  Emperor Gaozong suffered a stroke in 655, and Wu began to make many of his court decisions for him, discussing affairs of state with his councilors, who took orders from her while she sat behind a screen.  When Empress Wu's eldest son, the crown prince, began to assert his authority and advocate policies opposed by Empress Wu, he suddenly died in 675.  Many suspected he was poisoned by Empress Wu.  Although the next heir apparent kept a lower profile, in 680 he was accused by Wu of plotting a rebellion. He was then banished and later obliged to commit suicide.In 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was succeeded by Emperor Zhongzong, his eldest surviving son by Wu.  Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six weeks on the throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, Emperor Ruizong.  This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684.  Wu's armies suppressed them within two months.  She proclaimed the Tianshou era of Wu Zhou on October 16, 690, and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to crown prince.  He was also forced to give up his father's surname Li in favor of the Empress Wu.  She then ruled as China's only empress regnant.\nA palace coup on February 20, 705, forced Empress Wu to yield her position on February 22.  The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after.  To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the Great Cloud Sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the Maitreya Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world.  She even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death.  Arguably the most important part of her legacy was diminishing the hegemony of the Northwestern aristocracy, allowing people from other clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.\n\n\n=== Emperor Xuanzong's reign ===\n\nThere were many prominent women at court during and after Wu's reign, including Shangguan Wan'er (664\u2013710), a poet, writer, and trusted official in charge of Wu's private office. In 706 the wife of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, Empress Wei (d. 710), persuaded her husband to staff government offices with his sister and her daughters, and in 709 requested that he grant women the right to bequeath hereditary privileges to their sons (which before was a male right only). Empress Wei eventually poisoned Zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen-year-old son upon the throne in 710. Two weeks later, Li Longji (the later Emperor Xuanzong) entered the palace with a few followers and slew Empress Wei and her faction. He then installed his father Emperor Ruizong (r. 710\u2013712) on the throne. Just as Emperor Zhongzong was dominated by Empress Wei, so too was Ruizong dominated by Princess Taiping. This was finally ended when Princess Taiping's coup failed in 712 (she later hanged herself in 713) and Emperor Ruizong abdicated to Emperor Xuanzong.During the 44-year reign of Emperor Xuanzong, the Tang dynasty reached its height, a golden age with low economic inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court. Seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, Xuanzong even abolished the death penalty in the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself (these were relatively few, considering that there were only 24 executions in the year 730). Xuanzong bowed to the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions. His staunch Confucian chancellor Zhang Jiuling (673\u2013740) worked to reduce deflation and increase the money supply by upholding the use of private coinage, while his aristocratic and technocratic successor Li Linfu (d. 753) favored government monopoly over the issuance of coinage. After 737, most of Xuanzong's confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor Li Linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-Chinese generals. This policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against Xuanzong.\n\n\n=== An Lushan Rebellion and catastrophe ===\n\nThe Tang Empire was at its height of power up until the middle of the 8th century, when the An Lushan Rebellion (December 16, 755 \u2013 February 17, 763) destroyed the prosperity of the empire. An Lushan was a half-Sogdian, half-Turk Tang commander since 744, had experience fighting the Khitans of Manchuria with a victory in 744, yet most of his campaigns against the Khitans were unsuccessful. He was given great responsibility in Hebei, which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than 100,000 troops. After capturing Luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, Yan state. Despite early victories scored by Tang General Guo Ziyi (697\u2013781), the newly recruited troops of the army at the capital were no match for An Lushan's frontier veterans, so the court fled Chang'an. While the heir apparent raised troops in Shanxi and Xuanzong fled to Sichuan province, they called upon the help of the Uyghur Khaganate in 756. The Uyghur khan Moyanchur was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the Chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a Chinese princess as his bride. The Uyghurs helped recapture the Tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the Tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk. Even Abbasid Arabs assisted the Tang in putting down An Lushan's rebellion. The Tibetans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under Chinese control, and even after the Tibetan Empire had fallen apart in 842 (and the Uyghurs soon after) the Tang were in no position to reconquer Central Asia after 763. So significant was this loss that half a century later jinshi examination candidates were required to write an essay on the causes of the Tang's decline. Although An Lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757, this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel Shi Siming was killed by his own son in 763.\n\nOne of the legacies that the Tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the jiedushi, who slowly came to challenge the power of the central government. After the An Lushan Rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in Hebei went beyond the central government's control. After a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in today's Hebei, Shandong, Hubei and Henan provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushi's hereditary ruling without accreditation. The Tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. In return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs. As time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority. The rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the Song dynasty was established. Also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. Many poor fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates. With the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central Chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the Song's failed land nationalization during the 13th-century war with the Mongols.With the central government collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the Yangtze River with little resistance. In 858, massive floods along the Grand Canal inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the North China Plain, which drowned tens of thousands of people in the process.\nThe Chinese belief in the Mandate of Heaven granted to the ailing Tang was also challenged when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe that the Tang had lost their right to rule. Furthermore, in 873 a disastrous harvest shook the foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. In the earlier period of the Tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714 to 719 that the Tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. The central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. In the 9th century, however, the Tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.\n\n\n=== Rebuilding and recovery ===\n\nAlthough these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang dynasty. The government's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with fewer bureaucratic restrictions were opened up. By 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a money economy boosted by the merchant class. Cities in the Jiangnan region to the south, such as Yangzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou prospered the most economically during the late Tang period. The government monopoly on the production of salt, weakened after the An Lushan Rebellion, was placed under the Salt Commission, which became one of the most powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists. The commission began the practice of selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt, which they would then transport and sell in local markets. In 799 salt accounted for over half of the government's revenues. S.A.M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents \"the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state.\" Even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale. The Tangshu (Old Book of Tang) compiled in the year 945 recorded that in 828 the Tang government issued a decree that standardized irrigational square-pallet chain pumps in the country:\n\nIn the second year of the Taihe reign period [828], in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of Jingzhao Fu (d footnote: the capital) were ordered by the emperor to make a considerable number of machines, for distribution to the people along the Zheng Bai Canal, for irrigation purposes.|\nThe last great ambitious ruler of the Tang dynasty was Emperor Xianzong (r. 805\u2013820), whose reign was aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s, including a government monopoly on the salt industry. He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the Army of Divine Strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798. Between the years 806 and 819, Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them. Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials. However, Xianzong's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties. The eunuchs' power became unchallenged after Emperor Wenzong's (r. 826\u2013840) failed plot to have them overthrown; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the West Market of Chang'an, by the eunuchs' command.\n\nHowever, the Tang did manage to restore at least indirect control over former Tang territories as far west as the Hexi Corridor and Dunhuang in Gansu. In 848 the ethnic Han Chinese general Zhang Yichao (799\u2013872) managed to wrestle control of the region from the Tibetan Empire during its civil war. Shortly afterwards Emperor Xu\u0101nzong of Tang (r. 846\u2013859) acknowledged Zhang as the protector (\u9632\u79a6\u4f7f, Fangyushi) of Sha Prefecture and jiedushi military governor of the new Guiyi Circuit.\n\n\n=== End of the dynasty ===\nIn addition to natural calamities and jiedushi amassing autonomous control, the Huang Chao Rebellion (874\u2013884) resulted in the sacking of both Chang'an and Luoyang, and took an entire decade to suppress. The Tang never recovered from this rebellion, weakening it for future military powers to replace it. Large groups of bandits in the size of small armies ravaged the countryside in the last years of the Tang. They smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and convoys, and even besieged several walled cities. Amid the sacking of cities and murderous factional strife among eunuchs and officials, the top tier of aristocratic families, which had amassed a large fraction of the landed wealth and official positions, was largely destroyed or marginalized.During the last two decades of the Tang dynasty, the gradual collapse of central authority led to the rise of two prominent rival military figures over northern China: Li Keyong and Zhu Wen. Tang forces had defeated Huang Chao's rebellion with the crucial aid of allied Shatuo Turkic peoples of what is now Shanxi led by Li Keyong. He was made a jiedushi governor and later Prince of Jin, bestowed with the imperial surname Li by the Tang court. Zhu Wen, originally a salt smuggler who served as a lieutenant under the rebel Huang Chao, surrendered to Tang forces. By helping to defeat Huang, he was renamed Zhu Quanzhong (\"Zhu of Perfect Loyalty\") and granted a series of rapid military promotions to military governor of Xuanwu Circuit.In 901, from his powerbase of Kaifeng, Zhu Wen seized control of the Tang capital Chang'an and with it the imperial family. By 903 he forced Emperor Zhaozong of Tang to move the capital to Luoyang, preparing to take the throne for himself. In 904 Zhu assassinated Emperor Zhaozong to replace him with the emperor's young son Emperor Ai of Tang. In 905 Zhu executed the brothers of Emperor Ai as well as many officials and Empress Dowager He. In 907 the Tang dynasty was ended when Zhu deposed Ai and took the throne for himself (known posthumously as Emperor Taizu of Later Liang). He established the Later Liang, which inaugurated the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. A year later Zhu had the deposed Emperor Ai poisoned to death.Zhu Wen's hated nemesis Li Keyong died in 908 but, out of loyalty to Tang, Li never claimed the title of emperor. His son Li Cunxu (Emperor Zhuangzong) inherited his title Prince of Jin along with his father's rivalry against Zhu. In 923 Li Cunxu declared a \"restored\" Tang dynasty, the Later Tang, before toppling the Later Liang dynasty the same year. However, southern China would remain splintered into various small kingdoms until most of China was reunified under the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). Control over parts of northeast China and Manchuria by the Liao dynasty of the Khitan people also stemmed from this period. In 905 their leader Abaoji formed a military alliance with Li Keyong against Zhu Wen but the Khitans eventually turned against the Later Tang, helping another Shatuo leader Shi Jingtang of Later Jin to overthrow Later Tang in 936.\n\n\n== Administration and politics ==\n\n\n=== Initial reforms ===\n\nTaizong set out to solve internal problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties. Building upon the Sui legal code, he issued a new legal code that subsequent Chinese dynasties would model theirs upon, as well as neighboring polities in Vietnam, Korea, and Japan. The earliest law code to survive was the one established in the year 653, which was divided into 500 articles specifying different crimes and penalties ranging from ten blows with a light stick, one hundred blows with a heavy rod, exile, penal servitude, or execution.The legal code distinguished different levels of severity in meted punishments when different members of the social and political hierarchy committed the same crime. For example, the severity of punishment was different when a servant or nephew killed a master or an uncle than when a master or uncle killed a servant or nephew.\n\nThe Tang Code was largely retained by later codes such as the early Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) code of 1397, yet there were several revisions in later times, such as improved property rights for women during the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).The Tang had three departments (Chinese: \u7701; pinyin: sh\u011bng), which were obliged to draft, review, and implement policies respectively. There were also six ministries (Chinese: \u90e8; pinyin: b\u00f9) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These Three Departments and Six Ministries included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912).Although the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier Han dynasty (3rd century BC\u20133rd century AD), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.Although the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.The center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of Chang'an (modern Xi'an), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, acrobatic stunts, poetry, paintings, and dramatic theater performances. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese prefectural government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of municipal construction to build every visiting official his own private mansion in the capital.\n\n\n=== Imperial examinations ===\n\nStudents of Confucian studies were candidates for the imperial examinations, which qualified their graduates for appointment to the local, provincial, and central government bureaucracies. Two types of exams given, mingjing (\u660e\u7d93; \"illuminating the classics\") and jinshi (\u9032\u58eb; \"presented scholar\"). The mingjing was based upon the Confucian classics and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts. The jinshi tested a student's literary abilities in writing essays in response to questions on governance and politics, as well as in composing poetry. Candidates were also judged on proper deportment, appearance, speech, and calligraphy, all subjective criteria that favored the wealthy over those of more modest means who were unable to pay tutors of rhetoric and writing. Although a disproportionate number of civil officials came from aristocratic families, wealth and noble status were not prerequisites, and the exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the artisan or merchant classes. To promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the Five Classics with commentaries.Open competition was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers was to avoid imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and warlords by recruiting a body of career officials having no family or local power base. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, encouraging social mobility by preventing powerful families from becoming landed nobility through primogeniture. The competition system proved successful, as scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities while developing an esprit de corps that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, scholar-officials served as intermediaries between the people and the government. \nYet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the succeeding Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.\nThe examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite. The early Song emperors, concerned above all to avoid domination of the government by military men, greatly expanded the civil service examination system and the government school system.\n\n\n=== Religion and politics ===\n\nFrom the outset, religion played a role in Tang politics. In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the Taoism sage Lao Tzu (fl. 6th century BC). People bidding for office would request the prayers of Buddhist monks, with successful aspirants making donations in return. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Taoism were both accepted.\nReligion was central in the reign of Emperor Xuanzong (r. 712\u2013756). The Emperor invited Taoist and Buddhist monks and clerics to his court, exalted the Taoist ancient Lao Tzu with grand titles, wrote commentary on the Lao Tzu scriptures, and set up a school to prepare candidates for Taoist examinations. In 726 he called upon the Indian monk Vajrabodhi (671\u2013741) to perform Tantric rites to avert a drought. In 742 he personally held the incense burner while Amoghavajra (705\u2013774, patriarch of the Shingon school) recited \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"Emperor Xuanzong closely regulated religious finances. Near the beginning of his reign in 713, he liquidated the Inexhaustible Treasury of a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an which had collected vast riches as multitudes of anonymous repentants left money, silk, and treasure at its doors. Although the monastery used its funds generously, the Emperor condemned it for fraudulent banking practices, and distributed its wealth to other Buddhist and Taoist monasteries, and to repair local statues, halls, and bridges. In 714, he forbade Chang'an shops from selling copied Buddhist sutras, giving a monopoly of this trade to the Buddhist clergy.\n\n\n=== Taxes and the census ===\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and military conscription. The early Tang government established modest grain and cloth taxes on each household, persuading households to register and provide the government with accurate demographic information. In the official census of 609, the population was tallied at 9 million households, about 50 million people, and this number did not increase in the census of 742. Patricia Ebrey writes that nonwithstanding census undercounting, China's population had not grown significantly since the earlier Han Dynasty, which recorded 58 million people in the year 2. S.A.M. Adshead disagrees, estimating about 75 million people by 750.In the Tang census of 754, there were 1,859 cities, 321 prefectures, and 1,538 counties throughout the empire. Although there were many large and prominent cities, the rural and agrarian areas comprised some 80 to 90% of the population. There was also a dramatic migration from northern to southern China, as the North held 75% of the overall population at the dynasty's inception, which by its end was reduced to 50%.Chinese population would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty, when it doubled to 100 million because of extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with higher yields of grain sold in a growing market.\n\n\n== Military and foreign policy ==\n\n\n=== Protectorates and tributaries ===\nThe 7th and first half of the 8th century are generally considered to be the era in which the Tang reached the zenith of its power. In this period, Tang control extended further west than any previous dynasty, stretching from north Vietnam in the south, to a point north of Kashmir bordering Persia in the west, to northern Korea in the north-east.Some of the kingdoms paying tribute to the Tang dynasty included Kashmir, Nepal, Khotan, Kucha, Kashgar, Silla, Champa, and kingdoms located in Amu Darya and Syr Darya valley. Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as Tian Kehan. After the widespread G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk revolt of Shabol\u00fce Khan (d. 658) was put down at Issyk Kul in 657 by Su Dingfang (591\u2013667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese sphere of influence as far as Herat in Western Afghanistan. Protectorate Generals were given a great deal of autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.\n\n\n=== Soldiers and conscription ===\nBy the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury. By the late 7th century, the fubing troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system. The supposed standard of 100 mu of land allotted to each family was in fact decreasing in size in places where population expanded and the wealthy bought up most of the land. Hard-pressed peasants and vagrants were then induced into military service with benefits of exemption from both taxation and corv\u00e9e labor service, as well as provisions for farmland and dwellings for dependents who accompanied soldiers on the frontier. By the year 742 the total number of enlisted troops in the Tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.\n\n\n=== Eastern regions ===\n\nIn East Asia, Tang Chinese military campaigns were less successful elsewhere than in previous imperial Chinese dynasties. Like the emperors of the Sui dynasty before him, Taizong established a military campaign in 644 against the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo in the Goguryeo\u2013Tang War; however, this led to its withdrawal in the first campaign because they failed to overcome the successful defense led by General Yeon Gaesomun. Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom, the Chinese fought against Baekje and their Yamato Japanese allies in the Battle of Baekgang in August 663, a decisive Tang\u2013Silla victory. The Tang dynasty navy had several different ship types at its disposal to engage in naval warfare, these ships described by Li Quan in his Taipai Yinjing (Canon of the White and Gloomy Planet of War) of 759. The Battle of Baekgang was actually a restoration movement by remnant forces of Baekje, since their kingdom was toppled in 660 by a joint Tang\u2013Silla invasion, led by Chinese general Su Dingfang and Korean general Kim Yushin (595\u2013673). In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander Li Shiji (594\u2013669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.\n\nAlthough they were formerly enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, such as the brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634\u2013679) and Yeon Namsan (639\u2013701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire would control northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla broke the alliance and began the Silla\u2013Tang War to expel the Tang forces. At the same time the Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670. By 676, the Tang army was expelled out of Korea by Unified Silla. Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.Although the Tang had fought the Japanese, they still held cordial relations with Japan. There were numerous Imperial embassies to China from Japan, diplomatic missions that were not halted until 894 by Emperor Uda (r. 887\u2013897), upon persuasion by Sugawara no Michizane (845\u2013903). The Japanese Emperor Tenmu (r. 672\u2013686) even established his conscripted army on that of the Chinese model, his state ceremonies on the Chinese model, and constructed his palace at Fujiwara on the Chinese model of architecture.Many Chinese Buddhist monks came to Japan to help further the spread of Buddhism as well. Two 7th-century monks in particular, Zhi Yu and Zhi You, visited the court of Emperor Tenji (r. 661\u2013672), whereupon they presented a gift of a south-pointing chariot that they had crafted. This 3rd century mechanically driven directional-compass vehicle (employing a differential gear) was again reproduced in several models for Tenji in 666, as recorded in the Nihon Shoki of 720. Japanese monks also visited China; such was the case with Ennin (794\u2013864), who wrote of his travel experiences including travels along China's Grand Canal. The Japanese monk Enchin (814\u2013891) stayed in China from 839 to 847 and again from 853 to 858, landing near Fuzhou, Fujian and setting sail for Japan from Taizhou, Zhejiang during his second trip to China.\n\n\n=== Western and Northern regions ===\n\nThe Sui and Tang carried out successful military campaigns against the steppe nomads. Chinese foreign policy to the north and west now had to deal with Turkic nomads, who were becoming the most dominant ethnic group in Central Asia. To handle and avoid any threats posed by the Turks, the Sui government repaired fortifications and received their trade and tribute missions. They sent four royal princesses to form marriage alliances with Turkic clan leaders, in 597, 599, 614, and 617. The Sui stirred trouble and conflict amongst ethnic groups against the Turks. As early as the Sui dynasty, the Turks had become a major militarized force employed by the Chinese. When the Khitans began raiding northeast China in 605, a Chinese general led 20,000 Turks against them, distributing Khitan livestock and women to the Turks as a reward. On two occasions between 635 and 636, Tang royal princesses were married to Turk mercenaries or generals in Chinese service. Throughout the Tang dynasty until the end of 755, there were approximately ten Turkic generals serving under the Tang. While most of the Tang army was made of fubing Chinese conscripts, the majority of the troops led by Turkic generals were of non-Chinese origin, campaigning largely in the western frontier where the presence of fubing troops was low. Some \"Turkic\" troops were tribalized Han Chinese, a desinicized people.Civil war in China was almost totally diminished by 626, along with the defeat in 628 of the Ordos Chinese warlord Liang Shidu; after these internal conflicts, the Tang began an offensive against the Turks. In the year 630, Tang armies captured areas of the Ordos Desert, modern-day Inner Mongolia province, and southern Mongolia from the Turks. After this military victory, On June 11, 631, Emperor Taizong also sent envoys to the Xueyantuo bearing gold and silk in order to persuade the release of enslaved Chinese prisoners who were captured during the transition from Sui to Tang from the northern frontier; this embassy succeeded in freeing 80,000 Chinese men and women who were then returned to China.\n\nWhile the Turks were settled in the Ordos region (former territory of the Xiongnu), the Tang government took on the military policy of dominating the central steppe. Like the earlier Han dynasty, the Tang dynasty (along with Turkic allies) conquered and subdued Central Asia during the 640s and 650s. During Emperor Taizong's reign alone, large campaigns were launched against not only the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks, but also separate campaigns against the Tuyuhun, the oasis city-states, and the Xueyantuo. Under Emperor Gaozong, a campaign led by the general Su Dingfang was launched against the Western Turks ruled by Ashina Helu.The Tang Empire competed with the Tibetan Empire for control of areas in Inner and Central Asia, which was at times settled with marriage alliances such as the marrying of Princess Wencheng (d. 680) to Songts\u00e4n Gampo (d. 649). A Tibetan tradition mentions that Chinese troops captured Lhasa after Songts\u00e4n Gampo's death, but no such invasion is mentioned in either Chinese annals or the Tibetan manuscripts of Dunhuang.\nThere was a long string of conflicts with Tibet over territories in the Tarim Basin between 670 and 692, and in 763 the Tibetans even captured the capital of China, Chang'an, for fifteen days during the An Shi Rebellion. In fact, it was during this rebellion that the Tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now Gansu and Qinghai, which the Tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now Xinjiang. Hostilities between the Tang and Tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. The terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the Jokhang temple in Lhasa.\nDuring the Islamic conquest of Persia (633\u2013656), the son of the last ruler of the Sassanid Empire, Prince Peroz and his court moved to Tang China. According to the Old Book of Tang, Peroz was made the head of a Governorate of Persia in what is now Zaranj, Afghanistan. During this conquest of Persia, the Rashidun Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan (r. 644\u2013656) sent an embassy to the Tang court at Chang'an. Arab sources claim Umayyad commander Qutayba ibn Muslim briefly took Kashgar from China and withdrew after an agreement, but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. The Arab Umayyad Caliphate in 715 deposed Ikhshid, the king the Fergana Valley, and installed a new king Alutar on the throne. The deposed king fled to Kucha (seat of Anxi Protectorate), and sought Chinese intervention. The Chinese sent 10,000 troops under Zhang Xiaosong to Ferghana. He defeated Alutar and the Arab occupation force at Namangan and reinstalled Ikhshid on the throne. The Tang dynasty Chinese defeated the Arab Umayyad invaders at the Battle of Aksu (717). The Arab Umayyad commander Al-Yashkuri and his army fled to Tashkent after they were defeated. The Turgesh then crushed the Arab Umayyads and drove them out. By the 740s, the Arabs under the Abbasid Caliphate in Khorasan had reestablished a presence in the Ferghana basin and in Sogdiana. At the Battle of Talas in 751, Karluk mercenaries under the Chinese defected, helping the Arab armies of the Caliphate to defeat the Tang force under commander Gao Xianzhi. Although the battle itself was not of the greatest significance militarily, this was a pivotal moment in history, as it marks the spread of Chinese papermaking into regions west of China as captured Chinese soldiers shared the technique of papermaking to the Arabs. These techniques ultimately reached Europe by the 12th century through Arab-controlled Spain. Although they had fought at Talas, on June 11, 758, an Abbasid embassy arrived at Chang'an simultaneously with the Uighur Turks bearing gifts for the Tang Emperor. In 788\u2013789 the Chinese concluded a military alliance with the Uighur Turks who twice defeated the Tibetans, in 789 near the town of Gaochang in Dzungaria, and in 791 near Ningxia on the Yellow River.\n\nJoseph Needham writes that a tributary embassy came to the court of Emperor Taizong in 643 from the Patriarch of Antioch. However, Friedrich Hirth and other sinologists such as S.A.M. Adshead have identified Fu lin (\u62c2\u83fb) in the Old and New Book of Tang as the Byzantine Empire, which those histories directly associated with Daqin (i.e. the Roman Empire). The embassy sent in 643 by Boduoli (\u6ce2\u591a\u529b) was identified as Byzantine ruler Constans II Pogonatos (K\u014dnstantinos Pogonatos, or \"Constantine the Bearded\") and further embassies were recorded as being sent into the 8th century. S.A.M. Adshead offers a different transliteration stemming from \"patriarch\" or \"patrician\", possibly a reference to one of the acting regents for the young Byzantine monarch. The Old and New Book of Tang also provide a description of the Byzantine capital Constantinople, including how it was besieged by the Da shi (\u5927\u98df, i.e. Umayyad Caliphate) forces of Muawiyah I, who forced them to pay tribute to the Arabs. The 7th-century Byzantine historian Theophylact Simocatta wrote about the reunification of northern and southern China by the Sui dynasty (dating this to the time of Emperor Maurice); the capital city Khubdan (from Old Turkic Khumdan, i.e. Chang'an); the basic geography of China including its previous political division around the Yangtze River; the name of China's ruler Taisson meaning \"Son of God\", but possibly derived from the name of the contemporaneous ruler Emperor Taizong.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThrough use of the land trade along the Silk Road and maritime trade by sail at sea, the Tang were able to acquire and gain many new technologies, cultural practices, rare luxury, and contemporary items. From Europe, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, the Tang dynasty were able to acquire new ideas in fashion, new types of ceramics, and improved silver-smithing techniques. The Tang Chinese also gradually adopted the foreign concept of stools and chairs as seating, whereas the Chinese beforehand always sat on mats placed on the floor. People of the Middle East coveted and purchased in bulk Chinese goods such as silks, lacquerwares, and porcelain wares. Songs, dances, and musical instruments from foreign regions became popular in China during the Tang dynasty. These musical instruments included oboes, flutes, and small lacquered drums from Kucha in the Tarim Basin, and percussion instruments from India such as cymbals. At the court there were nine musical ensembles (expanded from seven in the Sui dynasty) that played ecletic Asian music.\n\nThere was great interaction with India, a hub for Buddhist knowledge, with famous travelers such as Xuanzang (d. 664) visiting the South Asian state. After a 17-year-long trip, Xuanzang managed to bring back valuable Sanskrit texts to be translated into Chinese. There was also a Turkic\u2013Chinese dictionary available for serious scholars and students, while Turkic folk songs gave inspiration to some Chinese poetry. In the interior of China, trade was facilitated by the Grand Canal and the Tang government's rationalization of the greater canal system that reduced costs of transporting grain and other commodities. The state also managed roughly 32,100 km (19,900 mi) of postal service routes by horse or boat.\n\n\n=== Silk Road ===\nAlthough the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141\u201387 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade.\n\nThe Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire withdrew its troops from its western lands, allowing the Tibetan Empire to largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded China's stringent immigrant laws . As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.\n\n\n=== Seaports and maritime trade ===\n\nChinese envoys had been sailing through the Indian Ocean to states of India since perhaps the 2nd century BC, yet it was during the Tang dynasty that a strong Chinese maritime presence  could be found in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, into Persia, Mesopotamia (sailing up the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq), Arabia, Egypt in the Middle East and Aksum (Ethiopia), and Somalia in the Horn of Africa.During the Tang dynasty, thousands of foreign expatriate merchants came and lived in numerous Chinese cities to do business with China, including Persians, Arabs, Hindu Indians, Malays, Bengalis, Sinhalese, Khmers, Chams, Jews and Nestorian Christians of the Near East, among many others. In 748, the Buddhist monk Jian Zhen described Guangzhou as a bustling mercantile business center where many large and impressive foreign ships came to dock. He wrote that \"many large ships came from Borneo, Persia, Qunglun (Indonesia/Java)...with...spices, pearls, and jade piled up mountain high\", as written in the Yue Jue Shu (Lost Records of the State of Yue). Relations with the Arabs were often strained: When the imperial government was attempting to quell the An Lushan Rebellion, Arab and Persian pirates burned and looted Canton on October 30, 758.  The Tang government reacted by shutting the port of Canton down for roughly five decades; thus, foreign vessels docked at Hanoi instead. However, when the port reopened, it continued to thrive. In 851 the Arab merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir observed the manufacturing of Chinese porcelain in Guangzhou and admired its transparent quality. He also provided a description of Guangzhou's landmarks, granaries, local government administration, some of its written records, treatment of travelers, along with the use of ceramics, rice, wine, and tea. Their presence came to an end under the revenge of Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, who purportedly slaughtered thousands regardless of ethnicity. Huang's rebellion was eventually suppressed in 884.\nVessels from neighboring East Asian states such as Silla and Balhae of Korea and the Hizen Province of Japan were all involved in the Yellow Sea trade, which Silla dominated. After Silla and Japan reopened renewed hostilities in the late 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from Nagasaki towards the mouth of the Huai River, the Yangtze River, and even as far south as the Hangzhou Bay in order to avoid Korean ships in the Yellow Sea. In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships and sixty Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River. It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.\n\nThe Chinese engaged in large-scale production for overseas export by at least the time of the Tang. This was proven by the discovery of the Belitung shipwreck, a silt-preserved shipwrecked Arabian dhow in the Gaspar Strait near Belitung, which had 63,000 pieces of Tang ceramics, silver, and gold (including a Changsha bowl inscribed with a date: \"16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign\", or 826, roughly confirmed by radiocarbon dating of star anise at the wreck). Beginning in 785, the Chinese began to call regularly at Sufala on the East African coast in order to cut out Arab middlemen, with various contemporary Chinese sources giving detailed descriptions of trade in Africa. The official and geographer Jia Dan (730\u2013805) wrote of two common sea trade routes in his day: one from the coast of the Bohai Sea towards Korea and another from Guangzhou through Malacca towards the Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka and India, the eastern and northern shores of the Arabian Sea to the Euphrates River. In 863 the Chinese author Duan Chengshi (d. 863) provided a detailed description of the slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade in a country called Bobali, which historians suggest was Berbera in Somalia. In Fustat (old Cairo), Egypt, the fame of Chinese ceramics there led to an enormous demand for Chinese goods; hence Chinese often traveled there (this continued into later periods such as Fatimid Egypt). From this time period, the Arab merchant Shulama once wrote of his admiration for Chinese seafaring junks, but noted that their draft was too deep for them to enter the Euphrates River, which forced them to ferry passengers and cargo in small boats. Shulama also noted that Chinese ships were often very large, with capacities up to 600\u2013700 passengers.\n\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n\n=== Art ===\n\nBoth the Sui and Tang Dynasties had turned away from the more feudal culture of the preceding Northern Dynasties, in favor of staunch civil Confucianism. The governmental system was supported by a large class of Confucian intellectuals selected through either civil service examinations or recommendations. In the Tang period, Taoism and Buddhism were commonly practiced ideologies that played a large role in people's daily lives. The Tang Chinese enjoyed feasting, drinking, holidays, sports, and all sorts of entertainment, while Chinese literature blossomed and was more widely accessible with new printing methods.\n\n\n=== Chang'an, the Tang capital ===\n\nAlthough Chang'an was the capital of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after subsequent destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10 km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8 km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout even mentioned in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian ky\u014d (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Taoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju (Chinese soccer). In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.\n\nThe Tang capital was the largest city in the world at its time, the population of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching two million inhabitants. The Tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of Persia, Central Asia, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Tibet, India, and many other places living within. Naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in Chang'an, there were also many different practiced religions, such as Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity, and Zoroastrianism, among others. With the open access to China that the Silk Road to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to China, while the city of Chang'an itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within. Exotic green-eyed, blond-haired Tocharian ladies serving wine in agate and amber cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers. If a foreigner in China pursued a Chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in China and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys. Several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from Chinese were passed during the Tang dynasty. In 779 the Tang dynasty issued an edict which forced Uighurs in the capital, Chang'an, to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying Chinese females, and banned them from passing off as Chinese.\n\nChang'an was the center of the central government, the home of the imperial family, and was filled with splendor and wealth. However, incidentally it was not the economic hub during the Tang dynasty. The city of Yangzhou along the Grand Canal and close to the Yangtze River was the greatest economic center during the Tang era.Yangzhou was the headquarters for the Tang government's salt monopoly, and was the greatest industrial center of China. It acted as a midpoint in shipping of foreign goods that would be organized and distributed to the major cities of the north. Much like the seaport of Guangzhou in the south, Yangzhou boasted thousands of foreign traders from all across Asia.There was also the secondary capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With a population of about a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring adequate supplies and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nThe Tang period was a golden age of Chinese literature and art. Over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 Tang authors have survived to the present day. Skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. Poetry styles that were popular in the Tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet Li Bai (701\u2013762) famous for the former style, and poets like Wang Wei (701\u2013761) and Cui Hao (704\u2013754) famous for their use of the latter. Jintishi poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line stanzas or seven characters per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the antithesis is often lost in translation to other languages). Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (\u56b4\u7fbd; active 1194\u20131245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713\u2013766) era with \"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for Du Fu (712\u2013770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.The Classical Prose Movement was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors Liu Zongyuan (773\u2013819) and Han Yu (768\u2013824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the piantiwen (\u9a19\u9ad4\u6587, \"parallel prose\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated piantiwen, they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct. This guwen (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with orthodox Neo-Confucianism.Short story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being Yingying's Biography by Yuan Zhen (779\u2013831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the Yuan dynasty (1279\u20131368) became the basis for plays in Chinese opera. Timothy C. Wong places this story within the wider context of Tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. Wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in Western romances such as Romeo and Juliet, but that underlying traditional Chinese values of inseparableness of self from one's environment (including human society) served to create the necessary fictional device of romantic tension.\n\nThere were large encyclopedias published in the Tang. The Yiwen Leiju encyclopedia was compiled in 624 by the chief editor Ouyang Xun (557\u2013641) as well as Linghu Defen (582\u2013666) and Chen Shuda (d. 635). The encyclopedia Treatise on Astrology of the Kaiyuan Era was fully compiled in 729 by Gautama Siddha (fl. 8th century), an ethnic Indian astronomer, astrologer, and scholar born in the capital Chang'an.\nChinese geographers such as Jia Dan wrote accurate descriptions of places far abroad. In his work written between 785 and 805, he described the sea route going into the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and that the medieval Iranians (whom he called the people of Luo-He-Yi) had erected 'ornamental pillars' in the sea that acted as lighthouse beacons for ships that might go astray. Confirming Jia's reports about lighthouses in the Persian Gulf, Arabic writers a century after Jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-Mas'udi and al-Muqaddasi. The Tang dynasty Chinese diplomat Wang Xuance traveled to Magadha (modern northeastern India) during the 7th century. Afterwards he wrote the book Zhang Tianzhu Guotu (Illustrated Accounts of Central India), which included a wealth of geographical information.Many histories of previous dynasties were compiled between 636 and 659 by court officials during and shortly after the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang. These included the Book of Liang, Book of Chen, Book of Northern Qi, Book of Zhou, Book of Sui, Book of Jin, History of Northern Dynasties and the History of Southern Dynasties. Although not included in the official Twenty-Four Histories, the Tongdian and Tang Huiyao were nonetheless valuable written historical works of the Tang period. The Shitong written by Liu Zhiji in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of Chinese historiography in past centuries until his time. The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, compiled by Bianji, recounted the journey of Xuanzang, the Tang era's most renowned Buddhist monk.\nOther important literary offerings included Duan Chengshi's (d. 863) Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, an entertaining collection of foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, mythical and mundane tales, as well as notes on various subjects. The exact literary category or classification that Duan's large informal narrative would fit into is still debated amongst scholars and historians.\n\n\n=== Religion and philosophy ===\n\nSince ancient times, some Chinese had believed in folk religion and Taoism that incorporated many deities. Practitioners believed the Tao and the afterlife was a reality parallel to the living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. Funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. This ideal is reflected in Tang dynasty art. This is also reflected in many short stories written in the Tang about people accidentally winding up in the realm of the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.Buddhism, originating in India around the time of Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130\u20131200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.The prominent status of Buddhism in Chinese culture began to decline as the dynasty and central government declined as well during the late 8th century to 9th century. Buddhist convents and temples that were exempt from state taxes beforehand were targeted by the state for taxation. In 845 Emperor Wuzong of Tang finally shut down 4,600 Buddhist monasteries along with 40,000 temples and shrines, forcing 260,000 Buddhist monks and nuns to return to secular life; this episode would later be dubbed one of the Four Buddhist Persecutions in China. Although the ban would be lifted just a few years after, Buddhism never regained its once dominant status in Chinese culture. This situation also came about through a revival of interest in native Chinese philosophies such as Confucianism and Taoism. Han Yu (786\u2013824)\u2014who Arthur F. Wright stated was a \"brilliant polemicist and ardent xenophobe\"\u2014was one of the first men of the Tang to denounce Buddhism. Although his contemporaries found him crude and obnoxious, he would foreshadow the later persecution of Buddhism in the Tang, as well as the revival of Confucian theory with the rise of Neo-Confucianism of the Song dynasty. Nonetheless, Ch\u00e1n Buddhism gained popularity amongst the educated elite. There were also many famous Chan monks from the Tang era, such as Mazu Daoyi, Baizhang, and Huangbo Xiyun. The sect of Pure Land Buddhism initiated by the Chinese monk Huiyuan (334\u2013416) was also just as popular as Chan Buddhism during the Tang.\n\nRivaling Buddhism was Taoism, a native Chinese philosophical and religious belief system that found its roots in the Tao Te Ching (a text attributed to a 6th-century BC figure named Lao Tzu) and the Zhuangzi. The ruling Li family of the Tang dynasty actually claimed descent from the ancient Lao Tzu. On numerous occasions where Tang princes would become crown prince or Tang princesses taking vows as Taoist priestesses, their lavish former mansions would be converted into Taoist abbeys and places of worship. Many Taoists were associated with alchemy in their pursuits to find an elixir of immortality and a means to create gold from concocted mixtures of many other elements. Although they never achieved their goals in either of these futile pursuits, they did contribute to the discovery of new metal alloys, porcelain products, and new dyes. The historian Joseph Needham labeled the work of the Taoist alchemists as \"protoscience rather than pseudoscience.\" However, the close connection between Taoism and alchemy, which some sinologists have asserted, is refuted by Nathan Sivin, who states that alchemy was just as prominent (if not more so) in the secular sphere and practiced more often by laymen.\n\nThe Tang dynasty also officially recognized various foreign religions. The Assyrian Church of the East, otherwise known as the Nestorian Church or the Church of the East in China, was given recognition by the Tang court. In 781, the Nestorian Stele was created in order to honor the achievements of their community in China. A Christian monastery was established in Shaanxi province where the Daqin Pagoda still stands, and inside the pagoda there is Christian-themed artwork. Although the religion largely died out after the Tang, it was revived in China following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.Although the Sogdians had been responsible for transmitting Buddhism to China from India during the 2nd to 4th centuries, soon afterwards they largely converted to Zoroastrianism due to their links to Sassanid Persia. Sogdian merchants and their families living in cities such as Chang'an, Luoyang, and Xiangyang usually built a Zoroastrian temple once their local communities grew larger than 100 households. Sogdians were also responsible for spreading Manicheism in Tang China and the Uighur Khaganate. The Uighurs built the first Manichean monastery in China in 768, yet in 843 the Tang government ordered that the property of all Manichean monasteries be confiscated in response to the outbreak of war with the Uighurs. With the blanket ban on foreign religions two years later, Manicheism was driven underground and never flourished in China again.\n\n\n=== Leisure ===\n\nMuch more than earlier periods, the Tang era was renowned for the time reserved for leisure activity, especially for those in the upper classes. Many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the Tang, including archery, hunting, horse polo, cuju (soccer), cockfighting, and even tug of war. Government officials were granted vacations during their tenure in office. Officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived 1,000 mi (1,600 km) away, or 15 days off if the parents lived more than 167 mi (269 km) away (travel time not included). Officials were granted nine days of vacation time for weddings of a son or daughter, and either five, three, or one days/day off for the nuptials of close relatives (travel time not included). Officials also received a total of three days off for their son's capping initiation rite into manhood, and one day off for the ceremony of initiation rite of a close relative's son.\n\nTraditional Chinese holidays such as Chinese New Year, Lantern Festival, Cold Food Festival, and others were universal holidays. In the capital city of Chang'an there was always lively celebration, especially for the Lantern Festival since the city's nighttime curfew was lifted by the government for three days straight. Between the years 628 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand carnivals nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, the granting of amnesties, the installment of a new crown prince, etc. For special celebration in the Tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals. This included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of Chang'an in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the Divine Strategy Army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826. Drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily ingrained into Chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event. A court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the 'Ale Grotto' built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends could drink.\n\n\n=== Status in clothing ===\n\nIn general, garments were made from silk, wool, or linen depending on your social status and what you could afford. Furthermore, there were laws that specified what kinds of clothing could be worn by whom. The color of the clothing also indicated rank. During this period, China's power, culture, economy, and influence were thriving. As a result, women could afford to wear loose-fitting, wide-sleeved garments. Even lower-class women's robes would have sleeves four to five feet in width.\n\n\n=== Position of women ===\n\nConcepts of women's social rights and social status during the Tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. However, this was largely reserved for urban women of elite status, as men and women in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields.There were many women in the Tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as Taoist priestesses. The head mistresses of high-class courtesans in the North Hamlet of the capital Chang'an acquired large amounts of wealth and power. Said courtesans, who likely influenced the Japanese geishas, were well respected. These courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.Although they were renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans were known to dominate the conversation among elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked too much or too loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.It was fashionable for women to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the presence of assertive, active women. The foreign horse-riding sport of polo from Persia became a wildly popular trend among the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed earthenware figurines from the time period portray). The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like \"an elaborate edifice above the forehead\", while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes. A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again in order to promote decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.There were some prominent court women after the era of Empress Wu, such as Yang Guifei (719\u2013756), who had Emperor Xuanzong appoint many of her relatives and cronies to important ministerial and martial positions.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nDuring the earlier Northern and Southern dynasties (420\u2013589), and perhaps even earlier, the drinking of tea (Camellia sinensis) became popular in southern China. Tea was viewed then as a beverage of tasteful pleasure and with pharmacological purpose as well. During the Tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. The poet Lu Tong (790\u2013835) devoted most of his poetry to his love of tea. The 8th-century author Lu Yu (known as the Sage of Tea) even wrote a treatise on the art of drinking tea, called The Classic of Tea. Although wrapping paper had been used in China since the 2nd century BC, during the Tang dynasty the Chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. This followed many other uses for paper such as the first recorded use of toilet paper made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531\u2013591), confirmed in 851 by an Arab traveler who remarked that Tang Chinese lacked cleanliness because they relied on toilet paper instead of washing themselves with water.In ancient times, the Chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: sesamum, legumes, wheat, panicled millet, and glutinous millet. The Ming dynasty encyclopedist Song Yingxing (1587\u20131666) noted that rice was not counted amongst the five grains from the time of the legendary and deified Chinese sage Shennong (the existence of whom Yingxing wrote was \"an uncertain matter\") into the 2nd millenniums BC, because the properly wet and humid climate in southern China for growing rice was not yet fully settled or cultivated by the Chinese. Song Yingxing also noted that in the Ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians' food was rice. During the Tang dynasty rice was not only the most important staple in southern China, but had also become popular in the north where central authority resided.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, wheat replaced the position of millet and became the main staple crop. As a consequence, wheat cake shared a considerable amount in the staple of Tang. There were four main kinds of cake: steamed cake, boiled cake, pancake, and Hu cake. Steamed cake was consumed commonly by both civilians and aristocrats. Like rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed with meat and vegetables. Shops and packmen regularly sold inexpensive steamed cake on the streets of Chang\u2019an. Boiled cake was the staple of the Northern Dynasties, and it kept its popularity in the Tang dynasty. It included a wide variety of dishes similar to modern wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water. While aristocrats favored wonton, civilians usually consumed noodles and noodle slice soup that were easier to produce. Pancakes was rare in China before the Tang, when it gained popularity. Food shops in Tang cities such as Chang'an commonly sold both pancakes and dumplings. Hu cake, which means \"foreign cake\", was extremely popular during the Tang. Hu cake was toasted in the oven, covered with sesame seeds, and served at taverns, inns and shops. Japanese Buddhist monk Ennin observed that Hu cake was popular among all of China's civilians.\n\nDuring the Tang, the many common foodstuffs and cooking ingredients in addition to those already listed were barley, garlic, salt, turnips, soybeans, pears, apricots, peaches, apples, pomegranates, jujubes, rhubarb, hazelnuts, pine nuts, chestnuts, walnuts, yams, taro, etc. The various meats that were consumed included pork, chicken, lamb (especially preferred in the north), sea otter, bear (which was hard to catch, but there were recipes for steamed, boiled, and marinated bear), and even Bactrian camels. In the south along the coast meat from seafood was by default the most common, as the Chinese enjoyed eating cooked jellyfish with cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, cardamom, and ginger, as well as oysters with wine, fried squid with ginger and vinegar, horseshoe crabs and red swimming crabs, shrimp and pufferfish, which the Chinese called \"river piglet\".From the trade overseas and over land, the Chinese acquired peaches from Samarkand, date palms, pistachios, and figs from Greater Iran, pine nuts and ginseng roots from Korea and mangoes from Southeast Asia. In China, there was a great demand for sugar; during the reign of Harsha over North India (r. 606\u2013647), Indian envoys to the Tang brought two makers of sugar who successfully taught the Chinese how to cultivate sugarcane. Cotton also came from India as a finished product from Bengal, although it was during the Tang that the Chinese began to grow and process cotton, and by the Yuan dynasty it became the prime textile fabric in China.Some foods were also off-limits, as the Tang court encouraged people not to eat beef. This was due to the role of the bull as a valuable working animal. From 831 to 833 Emperor Wenzong of Tang even banned the slaughter of cattle on the grounds of his religious convictions to Buddhism.Methods of food preservation were important, and practiced throughout China. The common people used simple methods of preservation, such as digging deep ditches and trenches, brining, and salting their foods. The emperor had large ice pits located in the parks in and around Chang'an for preserving food, while the wealthy and elite had their own smaller ice pits. Each year the emperor had laborers carve 1000 blocks of ice from frozen creeks in mountain valleys, each block with the dimension of 3 ft (0.91 m) by 3 ft by 3.5 ft (1.1 m). Frozen delicacies such as chilled melon were enjoyed during the summer.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\n\n=== Engineering ===\n\nTechnology during the Tang period was built also upon the precedents of the past. Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78\u2013139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.There were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3 ft (0.91 m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a lacquered-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal dragon-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of gravity when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats. Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\nMidway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century Ma Jun had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel. There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient Greco-Roman world, a design of the Greek inventor Heron of Alexandria that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of automatons used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the number of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel. This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny slot machine. Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a spring trap of some kind was employed here.In the realm of structural engineering and technical Chinese architecture, there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the Yingshan Ling (National Building Law). Fragments of this book have survived in the Tang L\u00fc (The Tang Code), while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the Yingzao Fashi (State Building Standards) by Li Jie (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered craftsmen serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).\n\n\n=== Woodblock printing ===\n\nWoodblock printing made the written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist dharani sutra unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670. The Diamond Sutra is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868. Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not. With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty. Although the later Bi Sheng's movable type printing in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant printing type in China until the more advanced printing press from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia. The first use of the playing card during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.\n\n\n=== Cartography ===\n\nIn the realm of cartography, there were further advances beyond the map-makers of the Han dynasty. When the Tang chancellor Pei Ju (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a graduated scale in the tradition of Pei Xiu (224\u2013271). The Tang chancellor Xu Jingzong (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658. In the year 785 the Emperor Dezong had the geographer and cartographer Jia Dan (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia. Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1 m (30 ft) in length and 10 m (33 ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred li (Chinese unit of measuring distance). A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li. However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are star charts. Despite this, the earliest extant terrain maps of China come from the ancient State of Qin; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.\n\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the medicines used in pharmacology. In 657, Emperor Gaozong of Tang (r. 649\u2013683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official materia medica, complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops. In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians. Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and Sun Simiao (581\u2013682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with diabetes had an excess of sugar in their urine, and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and starchy foods. As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the thyroid glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat goiters; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890. The use of the dental amalgam, manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text Xinxiu Bencao written by Su Gong in 659.\n\n\n=== Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning ===\nChinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of alchemy. These included a waterproof and dust-repelling cream or varnish for clothes and weapons, fireproof cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of underwater divers, a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas. The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as porcelain was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.Ever since the Han dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep boreholes to transport natural gas from bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt. During the Tang dynasty, a gazetteer of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182 m (600 ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device.The inventor Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a rotary fan for air conditioning, with seven wheels 3 m (10 ft) in diameter and manually powered. In 747, Emperor Xuanzong had a \"Cool Hall\" built in the imperial palace, which the Tang Yulin (\u5510\u8a9e\u6797) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains. During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.\n\n\n== Historiography ==\n\nThe first classic work about the Tang is the Old Book of Tang by Liu Xu (887\u2013946) et al. of the Later Jin, who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labeled the New Book of Tang) in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians Ouyang Xiu (1007\u20131072), Song Qi (998\u20131061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). Both of them were based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost. Both of them also rank among the Twenty-Four Histories of China. One of the surviving sources of the Old Book of Tang, primarily covering up to 756, is the Tongdian, which Du You presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor Sima Guang (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million Chinese characters in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the Warring States (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAbramson, Marc S.

    "The Monster Ball Tour": "The Monster Ball Tour was the second worldwide concert tour by American singer Lady Gaga. Staged in support of her extended play The Fame Monster (2009) and comprising a set list of songs from that and her debut album The Fame (2008), the tour visited arenas and stadiums from 2009 through 2011. Described as \"the first-ever pop electro opera\" by Gaga, the tour was announced in October 2009 after an intended joint concert tour with rapper Kanye West was suddenly cancelled. The Monster Ball Tour commenced four days after the release of The Fame Monster in November 2009.\nA revision of the tour occurred after only a few months of performances, due to Gaga's concern that the original version was constructed within a very short span of time. The stage of the original show looked like a frame, comparable to that of a hollowed-out television set. Since The Fame Monster dealt with the paranoias Gaga had faced, the main theme of the original shows became human evolution, while elements of the cancelled tour with West were still included in some parts. From 2010 onwards, the revamped shows had a New York theme and portrayed a story set in the city, where Gaga and her friends got lost and had to find their way to \"the Monster Ball\". Both versions of the show were divided into five segments, with the last being the encore. Each of them featured Gaga in new outfits, singing songs related to the concept of the segment, as they were followed by a video interlude.\nThe tour received positive reviews, with critics praising Gaga's singing abilities and the theatricality of the show. The Monster Ball was a commercial success, with extra demand for tickets prompting organisers to add multiple dates to the itinerary. It ultimately grossed an estimated US$227.4 million from 200 reported shows, attended by an audience of 2.5 million. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award. HBO filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Documenting the whole concert with intersperses of backstage footage, Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour: At Madison Square Garden, aired in May and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 21, 2011.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nInitially, rapper Kanye West and Lady Gaga had plans to launch a joint tour in October 2009, known as Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga. Amid negative response to his controversial outbursts at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, West declared that he would take a hiatus from his music career. Nevertheless, the complete schedule for Fame Kills was released, with the tour set to begin on November 10, 2009, in Phoenix, Arizona. Shortly afterwards, the tour was officially cancelled without any explanation. Gaga addressed the situation at Billboard's annual Women in Music luncheon, where she cited creative differences as the reason for the tour's cancellation. In an interview she stated, \"[Kanye] is going to take a break, but the good news is, I am not.\"After assuring the public that she would be embarking on her own tour, Gaga officially announced The Monster Ball Tour on October 15, 2009. It was originally planned to debut in London in early 2010, but ended up kicking off on November 27, 2009, in Montreal. Rapper Kid Cudi and singer Jason Derulo were confirmed as the supporting acts for the tour, with Cudi supporting Gaga from the beginning of the tour, and Derulo joining from December 28, 2009. The official poster for the tour featured Gaga in Versace 676 sunglasses and wearing a gyroscope around her called \"The Orbit\", which she first wore on the October 3, 2009, episode of Saturday Night Live. The contraption was designed by Nasir Mazhar in collaboration with Gaga's own creative production company, Haus of Gaga. The tour's sponsor of the American leg was Virgin Mobile USA, who introduced the \"Free I.P.\" program which offered free show tickets to fans who volunteered their time to homeless youth organizations.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Original concept ===\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Gaga explained that she wanted to put together an expensive looking, beautiful show which would be affordable for her fans. She asserted that the tour was a \"pop-electro opera\" because the theatrics and the story elements interwoven in it were played like an opera. According to her, the design of the show was innovative and forward in terms of creativeness. Gaga wanted to change the shape of the stage and designed one with Haus of Gaga that was \"essentially a frame with forced perspective, and the frame is put inside the stage.\" The stage had a triangular inset, like a diamond, and everywhere the show took place, the dimensions were measured in such a way that the box fit any stage. \"So no matter where I go, my fans get the same experience. So often you go into theaters and there's ambient light flying in from all sorts of places, and the audience is in different spots, and the stage is in different shapes and lengths and widths and depths, so this is a way for me to control all the light and all of the different elements of the show\", she added.The show revolved around themes of evolution, as well as her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; \"So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as one thing, and we become another.\" This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was \"another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to.\" Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that she did not want to use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was \"the great lost tour\", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.In an interview with MTV News, Gaga further described the tour:\n\n\"I begin as a cell and I grow and change throughout the show. And it's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic, which is, you know, it's part pop, part performance art, part fashion installation\u2014so all of those things are present... It's a story, it's me battling all my monsters along the way. I'm playing all the music from The Fame, all the music from The Fame Monster. And the stage that I designed with the Haus [of Gaga] is a giant cube that sits. Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen. It forces you to look at the center of the TV. It's my way of saying, 'My music is art.'\"\n\nFor the performance of \"Paparazzi\", Gaga had collaborated with her Haus of Gaga creative partner Matthew \"Matty Dada\" Williams. She had a different vision for it in the beginning. Dada thought that Gaga should wear her hair braided, which Gaga had never done before. Dada's explanation for the concept was the look of Rapunzel, the fairy-tale character. He felt that \"it's something people deeply understand. And when you're wearing sunglasses on a scaffolding piece with a giant alien dancing behind you, I promised [to Gaga] it's not going to look like Rapunzel.'\"\n\n\n=== Revamped concept ===\n\nIn December 2009, Gaga revealed that she planned to cancel the concept of the original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together \"something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time\". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. \"My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, just to give you an idea, the stage is about four times the size of the one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back\", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the Broadway performance musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the Broadway stage musical Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).During an interview with London's 95.8 Capital FM radio station, Gaga further elaborated on the changes in the show. She said that the show was constructed like a piece of musical theater. It also incorporated a number of contemporary and old musical pieces, some of them being re-recorded specifically for the show itself. A new keytar was constructed for the show and was named Emma. The instrument was created by the Haus of Gaga and the singer said, \"We have this new instrument that I brought to the Brits tonight, 'Emma', which is what I was playing on the stage. She's a hybrid from all these other instruments.\" During an interview on KISS-FM with Ryan Seacrest, on his show On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Gaga explained that the concert tour was still called Monster Ball, but it had become more of a musical and less of a concert. It had a New York theme at its core; telling a story where Gaga and her friends traveled to the Monster Ball, but got lost.\n\n\n== Concert synopsis ==\n\n\n=== Pre-revisions ===\n\nBeginning behind a giant, green, laser lit video screen featuring scrim lights, Gaga appeared in a bulb-covered futuristic silver jeweled jumpsuit with matching eye makeup and mask and sang \"Dance in the Dark\" as dancers, dressed in white balaclavas and white jumpsuits, moved around her. The video screen, resembling an electric mathematical grid, was eventually lifted during the performance. After the song, Gaga strapped a portable silver jeweled keyboard to herself and began to perform \"Just Dance\" while emerging from the inside of a white cube on a platform. This was followed by a brief video intermission and Gaga returned onstage in an off-white costume, that resembled an alien ecto-skeleton, while the dancers wore skeletal headgear. She started performing \"LoveGame\", which ended with Gaga pointing towards her groin. Flames appeared on the video screens, as she got out of her ecto-skeleton outfit. After stripping down to a silver bodysuit she performed \"Alejandro\", and was carried by her  crotch by one of her male dancers, and later lowered onto another one of them.The section was followed by a video interlude featuring snarling dogs and brooding ravens. The performance of \"Monster\" began with Gaga emerging in a black feathered jacket and performing dance moves reminiscent of Michael Jackson as the backdrops featured a black bird's wings. She continued with two songs from The Fame Monster titled \"So Happy I Could Die\" and \"Teeth\", after which she removed the feathered dress. Gaga then started performing the song \"Speechless\" on piano, and continued with an acoustic version of \"Poker Face\". Rapper Kid Cudi joined her then to perform his song \"Make Her Say\" which contains a sample of \"Poker Face\". This segment was followed by the performance of \"Fashion\" and \"The Fame\", during which Gaga wore a gold Egyptian styled crown and matching body suit, compared to the garment of a viking. Gaga crawled atop her piano during the follow-up songs \"The Fame\" and \"Money Honey\", after which she returned to the stage, dressed in black vinyl and nearly nude in a red patent leather bikini, to perform \"Boys Boys Boys\", backed by a squadron of skinny and shirtless leather boys. During \"Poker Face\", she wore a bondage inspired black leather dress with guns hanging from it and a hat made of muzzles, and pumped her hands in the air while performing the song. This was followed by Gaga sitting on a dentist's chair and spreading her legs during \"Paper Gangsta\". Another video interlude followed, displaying arty poses of Gaga in gothic looks.She returned to the stage while wearing  multiple donned braided extensions for \"Paparazzi\". Gaga was perched atop a railing and from each of her braids, a dancer was attached on the stage. A backdrop of stars were shown during the performance. The performance ended with the railing taking Gaga high above the stage, where she faked her death. This was followed by \"Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)\" as she descended from the top\u2014which signified her rebirth\u2014amidst white lights and mechanical fog. She wore a giant gyroscope around her, akin to \"The Orbit\" by Haus of Gaga. The last song of the show was \"Bad Romance\" which she performed in an '80s-inspired white power suit with exaggerated high shoulders and high-waisted pants. The show ended with a video of Gaga getting a heart-shaped tattoo on her shoulder, with the word \"Dad\" in the center of it.\n\n\n=== Post-revisions ===\n\nAfter revisions, the show was divided into four sections: City, Subway, Forest, Monster Ball and concluded with an encore. It began with a projected video onto a curtain\u2014which contained images of Gaga doing a 360 degree jump\u2014while a club remix of \"Dance in the Dark\" played. Surrounded by violet light, her silhouette appeared on the curtain while she performed \"Dance in the Dark\". Once the curtain was removed and the chorus reached, the New York cityscape and neon lights were revealed. Gaga gyrated on the set dressed in a \"futuristic, angular, glitter ball suit\". After descending from her fire escape, she poked around in the hood of a dilapidated green Rolls Royce while performing \"Glitter and Grease\". Upon checking under the vehicle's bonnet, Gaga revealed a keyboard and began to play the opening notes of \"Just Dance\". Gaga then performed \"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich\" while scaling various pieces of scaffolding and subsequently \"The Fame\" where she rose from beneath the stage and played her keytar Emma, wearing a giant red cape.\"LoveGame\" saw the beginning of the Subway section, with Gaga wearing a translucent nun's habit, and a skeletal hand. The song was performed with the aid of a gilded subway car and a \"disco stick\" while her next number \"Boys Boys Boys\" featured muscly male dancers cavorting in spandex shorts. After a costume change, Gaga burst into \"Money Honey\" with an extended keytar solo after emerging from beneath the stage as the New York scenery disappeared around her. As she walked towards the Glitter way, Gaga recalls when she was in jail and her friend Beyonc\u00e9 bailed her out, thus performing the song \"Telephone\". A piano is then brought in and Gaga goes into the song \"Brown Eyes\", after which she performs \"Speechless\" while the piano starts spitting fire. This segment also saw the performance of \"You and I\" in some of the shows; the song was later added to Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way. During this song, she tells the audience about her life as a teen in New York, and how she became who she is today. Gaga and her friends then continue down the Glitter Way, and soon they run into an angel, who plays an angelic tune that summons a twister, taking them closer to the Monster Ball, but landing them in a strange place that they did not know. Gaga sings \"So Happy I Could Die\", decked in a white dress, that moves on its own accord.The third segment begins with Gaga returning on the stage and singing \"Monster\", inside a forest with black, thorn-like trees. Her dancers conglomerate around her near the end and Gaga reveals herself to be covered with blood. She then states that the thing she hates more than money is the truth and performs \"Teeth\", while introducing her band. Gaga and her friends then find the Eternal Fountain, which pours out red colored liquid and Gaga explains that it bleeds for anyone. She starts singing \"Alejandro\" while jumping into the fountain and singing, as blood pours over her. Gaga then returns and sings \"Poker Face\" on the cat-walk. After the performance, she and her friends find themselves in a dark place, and after some dialogue, Gaga's friends run off, leaving her alone to deal with the Fame Monster, a giant angler fish. Gaga starts singing \"Paparazzi\" and eventually kills the Fame Monster by shooting sparks from her pyrotechnic bra and underwear. She then leaves for the Monster Ball and after appearing there, meanwhile fans assume the show is not over yet, suddenly Gaga appears on stage and  performs the song, \"Bad Romance\" while standing inside a giant gyroscope. After the song, she says that she can do one more song for an encore to the audience. Born This Way is performed with Gaga singing with a hand microphone and wearing a plastic two-piece ensemble and during the bridge, she performs an organ solo of Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. After the end of the song, she creates a monster paw with her dancers and finally the show is over as the curtain goes down.\n\n\n== Critical response ==\n\n\n=== Original show ===\n\nThe original version of the tour received generally positive reviews  from critics. Jane Stevenson from Toronto Sun gave the concert four out of five stars and said that Lady Gaga came across as a \"confident, colourful, and campy performer. [...] Gaga's success was evident with slick-looking videos, lights, elaborate costumes, dancers, and yes, a band, even if her stage was sometimes left dark as she left to make numerous changes.\" T'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking\u2014adding that the show never reached its peak until the end, when Gaga performed the \"real rendition\" of \"Poker Face\" and \"Bad Romance.\" \"Better late than never\", Dunlevy concluded. Aedan Helmer from Jam! magazine said that \"At first blush, it might seem the real driving force behind Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is her hand-picked cadre of costume and set designers\u2014dubbed Haus of Gaga\u2014who seemingly know no bounds when it comes to pushing the envelope of haute couture and the theatre of the absurd. [...] But what really sets Gaga apart from the middling masses of lip-synching Britney clones and Idol wannabes is her pure, unadulterated musical talent. [...] The Lady can sing.\" Theatre critic Kelly Nestruck, while writing for The Guardian, said \"While The Monster Ball has nothing on the great operas or the golden age of musical theatre, Lady Gaga's 'electro-pop opera' is at least twice as entertaining and infinitely fresher than any stage musical written over the last decade.\" Lauren Carter from Boston Herald praised the show saying \"[Gaga] only has two albums under her belt but who cares? Every song feels like a hit, and Gaga-as-star is already taking on Madonna-like proportions. [...] After [the show] at the Wang Theater, fans could justifiably walk away thinking Lady Gaga is crazy, brilliant or both.\" Jeremy Adams from Rolling Stone reviewed the performance at Wang Center in Boston and said that \"Throughout the evening, Gaga [..] aimed for a kind of pop theatricality that might potentially cement her burgeoning status as performance artist.\"Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle said that \"During her 90-minute performance\u2014not so much a live concert as a meticulously choreographed spectacle\u2014Lady Gaga also evoked Kanye West with the futuristic set, Britney Spears in her heavy-lidded stage movements, Courtney Love with her interminable between-song monologues highlighted by four-letter squelches and\u2014who else?\u2014Madonna for, oh, just about everything else.\" Jim Harrington from San Jose Mercury News felt that the show would have been better technically if around thirty minutes were lessened from it. James Montogomery from MTV reviewed the concert at San Diego and said that \"[Gaga] powered through and turned the San Diego Sports Arena into a raucous, delightfully raw discotheque.\" Writing for the Las Vegas Sun, Joe Brown observed that \"Lady Gaga out-Cher-ed Cher, made Cirque du Soleil and Britney's 'Circus Tour' look like county fair carnivals, and made New Year's Eve in Las Vegas anticlimactic.\" Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers avouched that the tour was \"an invigoratingly ambitious show, executed with vigor by its star and her expressive dancers.\" Jon Pareles from The New York Times said that the tour always provided \"something worth a snapshot: a sci-fi tableau, perhaps, or a skimpy, glittery costume. The more her image gets around, the better Lady Gaga does.\"\n\n\n=== Revamped show ===\n\nThe revamped concerts were also met with critical acclaim. Mark Savage from BBC Online reviewed the first of the revised performances in the United Kingdom. Savage described the concert as a hugely ambitious, terrifyingly loud show, \"spread over four acts and held together by a flimsy 'narrative' about Gaga and her dancer friends trying to get to a party.\" He was also impressed that the entire spectacle was put together in just four weeks. MTV's James Montogomery reviewed the first North American performance of the tour in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He said that the tour was \"packed with more wattage than an overheated power plant and more costume changes than a thousand Vegas reviews, it's the kind of show that leaves you with wide eyes, ringing ears, aching limbs and absolutely zero chance of making it to work in the morning.\" New York Daily News writer Jim Farber expected that the theatricality of the show might have obscured the songs, but instead felt that Gaga's voice was perfect and the concert actually \"pushed Gaga a long way towards her obvious goal \u2013 to be the queen of this pop moment.\" Glenn Gamboa from Newsday said that Gaga \"built her monster-sized fame on knowing how to create a spectacle and then having the substance to back it up. For every coat made of Kermit the Frog dolls or headdresses that covered her face in red lace, there was a stomping disco anthem or tender piano ballad to match. That back and forth is the centerpiece of her Monster Ball Tour.\" Dan Aquilante from the New York Post was critical of the show, calling it \"scripted, silly, and tired, right down to Gaga's patter.\" He added that the 15 costumes Gaga wore during the two-hour plus gig were \"more successful helping her cement the notion of an erotic and exotic otherworld.\" Writing in the Telegram & Gazette, Craig S. Semon was appreciative of the show, calling it \"an out-of-this-world blast and end-of-the-world blow-out that must be seen to be believed.\"Rick Massimo, reviewing the concert for The Providence Journal, wrote that as a musical theater, the Monster Ball was not that exciting, but \"that leaves the music, and when you lay two hours of her songs end-to-end, it's easy to see the vision, the intelligence and a serious songwriting talent at work.\" Jay N. Miller from The Enterprise was impressed with the show, saying that the music was somewhere between industrial disco and house music with a rock edge, but \"always danceable\". Philip Borof from Bloomberg Television reviewed the concert in New York's Madison Square Garden and found it average, calling the crowd decked in various costumes as the \"most entertaining\". Toronto Star's Ben Rayner appreciated the show, exclaiming \"hot damn, that was one hell of a show Gaga brought to the Air Canada Centre Sunday night and suddenly it doesn\u2019t seem redundant to add one more voice to the Lady Gaga choir.\" Mariel Concepci\u00f3n from Billboard felt that Gaga \"may be best known for her gaudy outfits and over-the-top stage shows, but at her hometown headlining debut at Madison Square Garden last night, the pop phenomenon proved she's a regular girl at heart.\" The Seattle Times staff writer Marian Liu declared that as \"one of the most anticipated touring acts of the year, [Gaga] stimulated the crowd's senses on Saturday night in a way few artists can. She brought spectacle and backed it up with soul.\" The Guardian journalist Alexis Petridis reviewed the opening show of the European leg, and commented that \"it takes a certain je ne sais quoi to open your show doing something that looks suspiciously like mime on a rickety metal staircase while wearing an outfit with shoulderpads the size of the deck on a small aircraft carrier.\"\n\n\n== Commercial reception ==\n\nAs soon as the dates for the show were announced, there was high demand for tickets. As sponsor of the North American Monster Ball Tour, Virgin Mobile customers had access to presale tickets. Bob Stohrer, VP of Marketing for Virgin Mobile USA said \"We are excited to take our partnership with Lady Gaga and The Monster Ball Tour to another level. [...] We'll also build on our partnership around combating youth homelessness and continue to enhance the tour experience for fans and our customers.\" Shows in the first leg of the tour were sold-out completely, prompting Live Nation Inc. to announce that Gaga will return to the U.S. in February 2011 for another run of U.S. dates. The 2011 dates for the North American Monster Ball Tour were announced as starting from February 19 in Atlantic City, with ten arena dates confirmed through April 18. Additional shows were announced, and Semi Precious Weapons collaborated with Gaga until the tour ended. Live Nation Entertainment's global touring division, headed by chairman Arthur Fogel, held the reins as promoter/producer of the Monster Ball tour.Fogel commented on Gaga's lack of experience in a tour and said that it was an opportunity for her. \"As an artist with that kind of talent and vision emerges, it creates a lot of excitement, and ticket sales worldwide demonstrate that people are really excited to see the show. Over the course of the next many months we're trying to play to as many people in as many places as possible\", Fogel added. \"It's an across the board home run.\" Demands increased and another additional six dates were added to the announced itinerary. The Monster Ball sold-out shows in Toronto, Vancouver and San Jose who were compelled to add second dates in each city. In Los Angeles, to ensure that concert goers had the best possible access to tickets, a second performance was announced prior to the onsale of the first shows, and both Staples Center concerts were completely sold out. Billboard estimated that by the time the tour wraps up in 2011, it would have grossed close to US$200 million worldwide.The ticket money from the final performance at Radio City was donated for the Haiti earthquake relief. Gaga announced on the rescheduled show at Elliott Hall of Music on January 26, 2010, that about US$500,000 was collected for the relief. At the 2010 Billboard Touring Awards, Gaga won the Breakthrough Performer Award, as well as the Concert Marketing & Promotion Award, the latter  being an acknowledgement of her partnership with Virgin Mobile. Billboard also placed The Monster Ball Tour at position four on their Year-end Top 25 Tours of 2010. They reported that the tour had grossed US$116 million from 122 shows, with an audience of 1.3 million.  By the end of the year, Pollstar announced that the tour had earned a total of US$133.6 million from 138 shows, making her the only woman to be placed in their list of the Top 10 Tours of 2010.The top grosser of The Monster Ball Tour were the two concerts at the Bell Centre in Montreal, which collectively earned over US$10 million. By amassing an audience of 111,060 from two shows, the performances at the Foro Sol in Mexico City attained the largest audience of the tour. Gaga's show at the United Center in Chicago became the highest-grossing concert of the third American leg; it earned an estimated US$1.8 million from 15,845 sold seats at a February 28, 2011 performance. The largest crowd, however, came from the Nashville market with 14,925 present at the Bridgestone Arena performance on April 19. The tour continued its presence in the Atlanta market on April 18, 2011, where she performed to 10,864 people at the Arena at Gwinnett Center. The third American leg concluded in Uniondale, New York with a sellout crowd of 13,195 at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on April 23, 2011. At the conclusion of 2011, The Monster Ball Tour grossed over US$70 million from 45 shows. By May 2011, the tour had grossed a total of US$227.4 million from the 200 reported shows, drawing an audience of 2.5 million, making it the highest-grossing tour in history by a debut headlining artist.\n\n\n== Broadcast and recordings ==\n\nHBO filmed a special of The Monster Ball Tour during Gaga's February 21\u201322, 2011 shows at Madison Square Garden.

    "Gargoyle Humor Magazine": "The Gargoyle Humor Magazine or The Gargoyle is the official student-run humor magazine for the University of Michigan. It has been satirizing both local and national events for more than one hundred years. The magazine is part of the university's Student Publications, which also includes the campus newspaper, The Michigan Daily, as well as the yearbook, the Michiganensian.\nTo current and former editors and staff, the magazine is often known simply as The Garg.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Gargoyle's office is located on the second floor of the Student Publications Building at 420 Maynard Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The office serves as the staff's production area; it is also home to a number of relics, including two bombshells obtained from the local army surplus and a poster from popular film Whore 2.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Gargoyle was founded in 1909.  Its first editor in chief, Lee A. White, eventually became editor of the Detroit News and helped found  La Choy Foods. Gargoyle was initially a literary magazine featuring stories, articles and pictures with a back section devoted to comedy.In the 1920s and 1930s, a period during which it was selected as America's Outstanding College Comic Magazine, Gargoyle was published monthly during the school year.  The decrease in male students brought about by World War II resulted in the first woman, Olga Gruhzit, becoming editor of Gargoyle in 1942. In 1944, at the height of the war, Gargoyle briefly ceased publication, only to return in the fall of 1945.Gargoyle was declared dead in 1950 when the Board in Control of Student Publications took offense to the issue \"The Smooth Gargoyle\".  Publication continued off campus for a year, and when Gargoyle returned the next year, literary pieces were discontinued and the focus became solely humor. During the 1950s the magazine acquired a counterculture reputation, promoting everything from co-ed housing in the 1950s to Vietnam War protests in the 1960s. In response to the advent of Playboy in the 1950s and the sexual revolution of the 1960s, Gargoyle became progressively more risque. While sex, illegal drugs, and otherwise raunchy jokes have been common fare in issues of the Gargoyle since the 1970s, the magazine has generally tried to maintain a level of intelligence and artistry in its humor.Art editor Phil Zaret's satirical cartoon, \"Kill a Commie for Christ\", originally published in the Gargoyle in 1967, became extremely popular during the Vietnam War and was re-published by college publications throughout the United States.Though the Gargoyle was very successful in the '60's, it struggled to publish in the early 1970s, returned for a few issues in 1974\u201375, and returned to consistent publication in 1979. The magazine has been forced off-campus (in 1950) and shut down completely (1960\u201361, 1997) as the result of editorial and financial conflicts with the Board for Student Publications (previously the Board in Control of Student Publications). At one time the magazine was sold for prices varying from fifty cents to two dollars, but for the last five years, it has been free, all revenue being generated by advertisements.In 1962, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz responded to a request for a Peanuts cartoon by drawing Snoopy with his nose perched over the end of his dog house in the manner of a gargoyle\u2014this became a standard Snoopy pose.\n\n\n== Mascots ==\nOver the decades it has been a Gargoyle tradition for the mascot to periodically change at the whims of the current editor and artists on staff.\n\n\n== Notable alumni ==\nIn the 1999 book, Gargoyle Laughs at the 20th Century, editor John Dobbertin compiled all Gargoyle staff members credited in the masthead to date.

    "King George V-class battleship (1911)": "The King George V-class battleships were a group of four dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy (RN) in the early 1910s that were sometimes termed super-dreadnoughts. The sister ships spent most of their careers assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Home and Grand Fleets, sometimes serving as flagships. In October 1914, Audacious struck a mine and sank. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive action of 19 August, the surviving ships' service during the First World War generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the North Sea.\nThe three surviving ships were briefly reduced to reserve in 1919 before being transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1920\u20131921 where they played minor roles in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War and the Chanak Crisis of 1922. The first ship to return to Britain, King George V, became a training ship in 1923 but the other two were placed into reserve again upon their return the following year. The imminent completion of the two  Nelson-class battleships in 1927 forced the sale of King George V and Ajax for scrap at the end of 1926 while Centurion was converted into a target ship to comply with the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty.\nDuring the Second World War, Centurion was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship and was then modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians quickly figured out the deception. The ship was deliberately sunk during the Invasion of Normandy in 1944 to form a breakwater.\n\n\n== Design and description ==\nOrdered as part of the 1910\u20131911 Naval Programme, the King George V class was an enlarged version of the preceding  Orion class with additional armour, a revised layout of the secondary armament and improved fire-control arrangements. The ships had an overall length of 597 feet 9 inches (182.2 m), a beam of 90 feet 1 inch (27.5 m) and a draught of 28 feet 8 inches (8.7 m). They displaced 25,420 long tons (25,830 t) at normal load and 27,120 long tons (27,560 t) at deep load. Their crew numbered around 869 officers and ratings upon completion and 1,114 in 1916.\n\nSea trials with the battlecruiser Lion showed that the placement of the fore funnel between the forward superstructure and the foremast meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely unworkable when the forward boilers were alight and that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind. The King George V class also used the same arrangement and they were altered while under construction to remedy the problem at a cost of approximately \u00a320,000 per ship. The fore funnel was moved aft and a makeshift foremast was built from one of the struts of the original tripod mast. The spotting tower at the rear of the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, and the coincidence rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower.The ships of the King George V class were powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines. The outer propeller shafts were coupled to the high-pressure turbines in the outer engine rooms and these exhausted into low-pressure turbines in the centre engine room which drove the inner shafts. The turbines used steam provided by 18 water-tube boilers. They were rated at 27,000 shaft horsepower (20,000 kW) and were intended to give the battleships a maximum speed of 21 knots (39 km/h; 24 mph). During their sea trials, the ships exceeded their designed speed and horsepower, reaching a maximum of 22.9 knots (42.4 km/h; 26.4 mph). They carried a maximum of 3,100 long tons (3,150 t) of coal and an additional 840 long tons (853 t) of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. This gave them a range of 5,910\u20136,310 nautical miles (10,950\u201311,690 km; 6,800\u20137,260 mi) at a cruising speed of 10 knots (19 km/h; 12 mph).\n\n\n=== Armament ===\n\nThe King George V class was equipped with ten 45-calibre breech-loading (BL) 13.5-inch Mark V gun in five hydraulically powered, centreline, twin-gun turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X' and 'Y' from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of +20\u00b0 which gave them a range of 23,830 yards (21,790 m). Their gunsights, however, were limited to +15\u00b0 until super-elevating prisms were installed by 1916 to allow full elevation. In contrast to the Orions, the loading machinery of these turrets was modified to accommodate longer and heavier 1,400-pound (635 kg) projectiles, some 150 pounds (68 kg) more than those of the Orions, at a muzzle velocity of about 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s) at a rate of two rounds per minute. The ships carried 100 shells per gun.Training exercises had shown that destroyer and torpedo boats attacked more frequently from the frontal arc, so the sixteen 50-calibre BL four-inch (102 mm) Mark VII guns of the secondary armament was re-arranged to improve fire distribution ahead. Eight of these were mounted in the forward superstructure, four in the aft superstructure, and four in casemates in the side of the hull abreast of the forward main gun turrets, all in single mounts. The guns in the hull casemates were frequently unusable in heavy seas and were later removed during the war. The Mark VII guns had a maximum elevation of +15\u00b0 which gave them a range of 11,400 yards (10,424 m). They fired 31-pound (14.1 kg) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2,821 ft/s (860 m/s). They were provided with 150 rounds per gun. Four 3-pounder (1.9 in (47 mm)) saluting guns were also carried. The ships were equipped with three 21-inch submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and another in the stern, for which 14 torpedoes were provided.\n\n\n=== Fire-control ===\nThe ships of the King George V class were some of the first battleships in the RN to receive the full suite of fire-control equipment used during the First World War. The control position for the main armament was located in the conning tower. Data from a 9-foot (2.7 m) coincidence rangefinder (an unstabilized Barr and Stroud instrument in King George V and stabilized Argo units in the other ships) on the roof of the conning tower, together with the target's speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to a Dreyer Fire-control Table (a Mark III system in King George V and Mark II Tables in the others with an Argo range clock replacing the Dreyer-Elphinstone model in the Mark III) located in the transmitting station located on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was called down to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered telephone. The fire-control table integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. As a backup, two turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.\n\nFire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I, and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. The weight of the director and the enlarged spotting top proved to be more than the unsupported foremast could bear, and it had to be reinforced when the directors were installed in 1913\u20131914 on the roof of the spotting top. The mast of King George V used flanges, but the other three ships received half-height tripod legs. The former ship's mast was rebuilt into a full-height tripod in 1918. Available sources do not acknowledge that Audacious was fitted with a director before her loss, but photographic evidence clearly shows one visible as she was sinking.\n\n\n=== Armour ===\nThe King George Vs had a waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour that was 12 inches (305 mm) thick between the fore and rear barbettes. It reduced to 2.5\u20136 inches (64\u2013152 mm) outside the central armoured citadel, but did not reach the bow or stern. The belt covered the side of the hull from 16 feet 10.5 inches (5.1 m) above the waterline to 3 feet 4 inches (1.0 m) below it. Above this was a strake of 9-inch (229 mm) armour. The fore and aft oblique 10-inch (254 mm) bulkheads connected the waterline and upper armour belts to the 'A' and 'Y' barbettes. The exposed faces of the barbettes were protected by armour 9 to 10 inches thick above the main deck that thinned to 3\u20137 inches (76\u2013178 mm) below it. The gun turrets had 11-inch (279 mm) faces sides with 3- to 4-inch roofs. The guns in the forward superstructure were protected by armour 3\u20133.5 inches (76\u201389 mm) thick.The four armoured decks ranged in thickness from 1 to 4 inches (25 to 102 mm) with the greater thicknesses outside the central armoured citadel. The front and sides of the conning tower were protected by 11-inch plates, although the roof was 3 inches thick. The gunnery control tower behind and above the conning tower had 4-inch sides and the torpedo-control tower aft had 6-inch sides and a 3-inch roof. Unlike the Orions, the anti-torpedo bulkheads were extended to cover the engine rooms, as well as the magazines with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 1.75 inches (25 to 44 mm). The boiler uptakes were protected by 1\u20131.5-inch (25\u201338 mm) armour plates.\n\n\n=== Modifications ===\nBy October 1914, a pair of QF 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns were installed aboard each ship. About 80 long tons (81 t) of additional deck armour was added after the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and King George V was fitted to tow kite balloons around the same time. By April 1917, the ships had exchanged a 4-inch AA gun for one of the 3-inch guns and the four 4-inch guns in the hull casemates had been removed. The stern torpedo tube was removed during 1917\u20131918 and one or two flying-off platforms were fitted aboard each ship in 1918; these were mounted on turret roofs and extended onto the gun barrels. King George V had them on 'B' and 'Q' turrets, Centurion on 'B' and 'X' turrets and Ajax had one on 'B'.\n\n\n== Ships ==\n\n\n== Careers ==\n\nWhile conducting her sea trials on the night of 9/10 December, Centurion accidentally rammed and sank the Italian steamer SS Derna and she was under repair until March 1913. All four ships of the King George V class were assigned to the 2nd Battle Squadron upon commissioning, commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir George Warrender, and King George V was the squadron flagship by 18 February 1913. Centurion was present to receive the President of France, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, at Spithead on 24 June 1913. The sisters represented the Royal Navy during the celebrations of the re-opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal in Kiel, Germany, 23\u201330 June 1914, held in conjunction with Kiel Week.\n\nBetween 17 and 20 July 1914, the King George Vs took part in a test mobilisation and fleet review as part of the British response to the July Crisis. Afterwards, they were ordered to proceed with the rest of the Home Fleet to Scapa Flow to safeguard the fleet from a possible surprise attack by the Imperial German Navy. After the British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August, the Home Fleet was reorganised as the Grand Fleet, and placed under the command of Admiral Jellicoe. According to pre-war doctrine, the role of the Grand Fleet was to fight a decisive battle against the German High Seas Fleet. This grand battle was slow to happen, however, because of the Germans' reluctance to commit their battleships against the superior British force. As a result, the Grand Fleet spent its time training in the North Sea, punctuated by the occasional mission to intercept a German raid or major fleet sortie. While the 2nd Battle Squadron was conducting gunnery training off the northern coast of Ireland on 27 October, Audacious struck a mine and sank; all of her crew was successfully rescued before she capsized. King George V developed problems with her condensers in November. This forced the ship to be intermittently withdrawn from operations over the next several months while the condensers had their tubes replaced.\n\n\n=== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ===\n\nThe Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans for a German attack on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in mid-December using the four battlecruisers of Konteradmiral (Rear-Admiral) Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group. The radio messages did not mention that the High Seas Fleet with fourteen dreadnoughts and eight predreadnoughts would reinforce Hipper. The ships of both sides departed their bases on 15 December, with the British intending to ambush the German ships on their return voyage. They mustered the six dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron, including the three surviving King George Vs, and the four battlecruisers of Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty.The screening forces of each side blundered into each other during the early morning darkness and heavy weather of 16 December. The Germans got the better of the initial exchange of fire, severely damaging several British destroyers, but Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, commander of the High Seas Fleet, ordered his ships to turn away, concerned about the possibility of a massed attack by British destroyers in the dawn's light. A series of miscommunications and mistakes by the British allowed Hipper's ships to avoid an engagement with Beatty's forces.\n\n\n=== Battle of Jutland ===\n\nIn an attempt to lure out and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, the German High Seas Fleet departed the Jade Bight early on the morning of 31 May 1916 in support of Hipper's battlecruisers which were to act as bait. Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation, so the Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet to sortie the night before to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.Once Jellicoe's ships had rendezvoused with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, on the morning of 31 May, he organised the main body of the Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd Battle Squadron were on his left (east), the 4th Battle Squadron was in the centre and the 1st Battle Squadron on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd Battle Squadron at the head of the line of battle. The sisters were able to fire a few volleys at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group without effect early in the battle, but the manoeuvers of their escorting light cruisers frequently blocked their views of the German ships. Coupled with the visibility problems from the smoke and mist, none of the King George Vs were able to fire more than 19 rounds from their main guns.\n\n\n=== Subsequent activity ===\n\nThe Grand Fleet sortied on 18 August 1916 to ambush the High Seas Fleet while it advanced into the southern North Sea, but a series of miscommunications and mistakes prevented Jellicoe from intercepting the German fleet before it returned to port. Two light cruisers were sunk by German U-boats during the operation, prompting Jellicoe to decide to not risk the major units of the fleet south of 55\u00b0 30' North due to the prevalence of German submarines and mines. The Admiralty concurred and stipulated that the Grand Fleet would not sortie unless the German fleet was attempting an invasion of Britain or there was a strong possibility it could be forced into an engagement under suitable conditions. Along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, they sortied on the afternoon of 23 April 1918 after radio transmissions revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. The Germans were too far ahead of the British to be caught, and no shots were fired. The sisters were present at Rosyth, Scotland, when the German fleet surrendered there on 21 November.\n\n\n=== Postwar activities ===\n\nThe sisters remained with the 2nd Battle Squadron into early 1919, after which King George V became the flagship of the 3rd Battle Squadron until that unit was disbanded later that year. The ship then became flagship of the Reserve Fleet and served until late 1920. In the meantime, Ajax had been transferred to 4th Battle Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet by mid-1919 and sometimes served as the Fleet's flagship. Centurion followed in early 1920, although she spent a lot of time in reserve in Malta. The sisters played minor roles in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea in 1919\u20131920. King George V joined them in the 4th Battle Squadron in early 1921. After striking a rock in early September 1922, she was in Smyrna, Turkey, receiving temporary repairs when the Great Fire of Smyrna occurred later that month and evacuated some refugees when she sailed for permanent repairs at Malta. Her sisters were in Turkish waters during the Chanak Crisis around the same time. King George V was the first of the trio to return home in early 1923 and she served a training ship until she was sold for scrap at the end of 1926. Ajax and Centurion followed in April 1924, although they were placed in reserve, with the latter serving as the flagship of the Reserve Fleet. Like King George V, Ajax was sold for scrap at the end of 1926.\n\nThe British tonnage allowance granted by the Washington Naval Treaty permitted them to keep the three sisters in service until the two  Nelson-class battleship were completed in 1927. While King George V and Ajax were scrapped, Centurion was demilitarized by the removal of her armament and was converted into a radio-controlled target ship. In addition to being used as a target for surface ships, Centurion was used to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of aerial bombing. During the Second World War, she was rearmed with light weapons and was converted into a blockship in 1941. In preparation for that operation (subsequently cancelled), she was modified into a decoy with dummy gun turrets in an attempt to fool the Axis powers. Centurion was sent to the Mediterranean in 1942 to escort a convoy to Malta, although the Italians may have figured out the deception. The ship was scuttled off Omaha Beach in June 1944 to form a breakwater to protect a mulberry harbour built to supply the forces ashore.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBrooks, John (2005).

    "Ferric EDTA": "Ferric EDTA is the coordination complex formed from ferric ions and EDTA. EDTA has a high affinity for ferric ions.  It is a yellow solid that gives yellowish aqueous solutions.\n\n\n== Synthesis and structure ==\nSolutions of Fe-EDTA are produced by combining ferrous salts and aqueous solutions of EDTA known as Jacobson's solution.Near neutral pH, the principal complex is [Fe(EDTA)(H2O)]\u2212, although most sources ignore the aquo ligand. The [Fe(EDTA)(H2O)]\u2212 anion has been crystallized with many cations, e.g., the trihydrate Na[Fe(EDTA)(H2O)].2H2O.  The salts as well as the solutions are yellow-brown. Provided the nutrient solution in which the [Fe(EDTA)(H2O)]\u2212 complex will be used has a pH of at least 5.5, all the uncomplexed iron, as a result of incomplete synthesis reaction, will still change into the chelated ferric form.\n\n\n== Uses ==\nIn contact with aerated natural waters, iron salts convert to the ferric form.  Near neutral pH, ferric ions form insoluble solids and are thus not bioavailable.  EDTA (and other chelating agents) address this problem, by forming soluble complexes that resist formation of hydroxides.Together with pentetic acid (DTPA), EDTA is widely used for sequestering metal ions. Otherwise these metal ions catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which is used to bleach pulp in papermaking. Several million kilograms EDTA are produced for this purpose annually.Iron chelate is commonly used for agricultural purposes to treat chlorosis, a condition in which leaves produce insufficient chlorophyll. Iron and ligand are absorbed separately by the plant roots whereby the highly stable ferric chelate is first reduced to the less stable ferrous chelate.   In horticulture, iron chelate is often referred to as 'sequestered iron' and is used as a plant tonic, often mixed with other nutrients and plant foods (e.g. seaweed).   It is recommended in ornamental horticulture for feeding ericaceous plants like Rhododendrons if they are growing in calcareous soils.  The sequestered iron is available to the ericaceous plants, without adjusting the soil's pH, and thus, lime-induced chlorosis is prevented.\nFerric EDTA may serve as plant available iron supplement for the Hoagland solution or the Long Ashton solution. According to Jacobson (1951), the stability of ferric EDTA was tested by adding 5 ppm iron, as the complex, to Hoagland's solution at various pH values. No loss of iron occurred below pH 6. In addition to Jacobson's original recipe and a modified protocol by Steiner and van Winden (1970), an updated version for producing the ferric EDTA complex is presented in Table (1) and the following description:\nTable (1). Reagents to prepare the modified ferric EDTA stock solution\n\nThe formation of Fe(III)-EDTA (FeY)\u2212 can be described as:\nFeSO4\u22197H2O  +  K2H2Y  +  1/4 O2  \u2192  K[FeY(H2O)].H2O  +  KHSO4  +  5.5 H2O\nFor this purpose iron(II) sulfate is dissolved in 300 mL water with the addition of 4 mL sulfuric acid. EDTA is dissolved in 300 mL water and 280 mL KOH. The ferrous sulfate and EDTA solutions are pooled, stirred, and actively aerated in the dark for 16 hours. The prepared Fe(III)-EDTA solution is filled up to 1 L and stored in the refrigerator. 1 mL ferric EDTA stock solution dissolved in 1 L results in 5 ppm Fe (or 90 \u00b5mol/L Fe3+ chelate) which corresponds to a full-strength ferric EDTA solution.Iron chelate has also been used as a bait in the chemical control of slugs, snails and slaters in agriculture in Australia and New Zealand. They have advantages over other more generally poisonous substances used as their toxicity is more specific to molluscs.\n\n\n== Related derivatives ==\nAside from ferric EDTA, iron complex of EDDHA is used to make the iron soluble in water and, for the purposes of agriculture, accessible to plants.In iron chelation therapy, deferoxamine, has been used to treat excess iron stores, i.e. haemochromatosis.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDTPA\nEDDHA\nTartrate\nCitrate\n\n\n== References ==",
    "William F. Egan": "William F. Egan is an expert and author in the area of PLLs. The first and second editions of his book \nFrequency Synthesis by Phase Lock\nas well as his book Phase-Lock Basics \nare references among electrical engineers specializing in areas involving PLLs.\n\n\n== Egan's conjecture on the pull-in range of type II APLL ==\n\nIn 1981, describing the high-order PLL, William Egan conjectured that type II APLL has theoretically infinite the hold-in and pull-in ranges.:\u200a176\u200a:\u200a245\u200a:\u200a192\u200a:\u200a161\u200a From a mathematical point of view, that means that the loss of global stability in type II APLL is caused by the birth of self-excited oscillations and not hidden oscillations (i.e., the boundary of global stability and the pull-in range in the space of parameters is trivial). \nThe conjecture can be found in various later publications, see e.g.:\u200a96\u200a and:\u200a6\u200a for type II CP-PLL. The hold-in and pull-in ranges of type II APLL for a given parameters may be either (theoretically) infinite or empty, thus, since the pull-in range is a subrange of the hold-in range, the question is whether the infinite hold-in range implies infinite pull-in range (the Egan problem). \nAlthough it is known that for the second-order type II APLL the conjecture is valid,:\u200a146\u200a the work by Kuznetsov et al. \nshows that the Egan conjecture may be not valid in some cases.\nA similar statement for the second-order APLL with lead-lag filter is known as Kapranov's conjecture on the pull-in range of type I APLL.\nIn general, his conjecture is not valid and the global stability and the pull-in range for the type I APLL with lead-lag filters may be limited by the birth of hidden oscillations (hidden boundary of the global stability and the pull-in range). \nFor control systems, a similar conjecture was formulated by R. Kalman in 1957 (see Kalman's conjecture).\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Traina": "In rail transport, a train is a series of connected vehicles that run along a railway track and transport people or freight. The word train comes from the Old French trahiner, derived from the Latin trahere meaning \"to pull, to draw\". Trains are typically pulled or pushed by locomotives (often known simply as \"engines\"), though some are self-propelled, such as multiple units. Passengers and cargo are carried in railroad cars, also known as wagons. Trains are designed to a certain gauge, or distance between rails. Most trains operate on steel tracks with steel wheels, the low friction of which makes them more efficient than other forms of transport.\nTrains have their roots in wagonways, which used railway tracks and were powered by horses or pulled by cables. Following the invention of the steam locomotive in the United Kingdom in 1804, trains rapidly spread around the world, allowing freight and passengers to move over land faster and cheaper than ever possible before. Rapid transit and trams were first built in the late 1800s to transport large numbers of people in and around cities. Beginning in the 1920s, and accelerating following World War II, diesel and electric locomotives replaced steam as the means of motive power. Following the development of cars, trucks, and extensive networks of highways which offered greater mobility, as well as faster airplanes, trains declined in importance and market share, and many rail lines were abandoned. The spread of buses led to the closure of many rapid transit and tram systems during this time as well.\nSince the 1970s, governments, environmentalists, and train advocates have promoted increased use of trains due to their greater fuel efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to other modes of land transport. High-speed rail, first built in the 1960s, has proven competitive with cars and planes over short to medium distances. Commuter rail has grown in importance since the 1970s as an alternative to congested highways and a means to promote development, as has light rail in the 21st century. Freight trains remain important for the transport of bulk commodities such as coal and grain, as well as being a means of reducing road traffic congestion by freight trucks.\nWhile conventional trains operate on relatively flat tracks with two rails, a number of specialized trains exist which are significantly different in their mode of operation. Monorails operate on a single rail, while funiculars and rack railways are uniquely designed to traverse steep slopes. Experimental trains such as high speed maglevs, which use magnetic levitation to float above a guideway, are under development in the 2020s and offer higher speeds than even the fastest conventional trains. Development of trains which use alternative fuels such as natural gas and hydrogen is another 21st century development.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nTrains are an evolution of wheeled wagons running on stone wagonways, the earliest of which were built by Babylon circa 2,200 BCE. Starting in the 1500s, wagonways were introduced to haul material from mines; from the 1790s, stronger iron rails were introduced. Following early developments in the second half of the 1700s, in 1804 a steam locomotive built by British inventor Richard Trevithick powered the first ever steam train. Outside of coal mines, where fuel was readily available, steam locomotives remained untried until the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. British engineer George Stephenson ran a steam locomotive named Locomotion No. 1 on this 40-kilometer (25-mile) long line, hauling over 400 passengers at up to 13 kilometers per hour (8 mph). The success of this locomotive, and Stephenson's Rocket in 1829, convinced many of the value in steam locomotives, and within a decade the stock market bubble known as \"Railway Mania\" started across the United Kingdom.\nNews of the success of steam locomotives quickly reached the United States, where the first steam railroad opened in 1829. American railroad pioneers soon started manufacturing their own locomotives, designed to handle the sharper curves and rougher track typical of the country's railroads.The other nations of Europe also took note of British railroad developments, and most countries on the continent constructed and opened their first railroads in the 1830s and 1840s, following the first run of a steam train in France in late 1829. In the 1850s, trains continued to expand across Europe, with many influenced by or purchases of American locomotive designs. Other European countries pursued their own distinct designs. Around the world, steam locomotives grew larger and more powerful throughout the rest of the century as technology advanced.Trains first entered service in South America, Africa, and Asia through construction by imperial powers, which starting in the 1840s built railroads to solidify control of their colonies and transport cargo for export. In Japan, which was never colonized, railroads first arrived in the early 1870s. By 1900, railroads were operating on every continent besides uninhabited Antarctica.\n\n\n=== New technologies ===\nEven as steam locomotive technology continued to improve, inventors in Germany started work on alternative methods for powering trains. Werner von Siemens built the first train powered by electricity in 1879, and went on to pioneer electric trams. Another German inventor, Rudolf Diesel, constructed the first diesel engine in the 1890s, though the potential of his invention to power trains was not realized until decades later. Between 1897 and 1903, tests of experimental electric locomotives on the Royal Prussian Military Railway in Germany demonstrated they were viable, setting speed records in excess of 160 kilometers per hour (100 mph).Early gas powered \"doodlebug\" self-propelled railcars entered service on railroads in the first decade of the 1900s. Experimentation with diesel and gas power continued, culminating in the German \"Flying Hamburger\" in 1933, and the influential American EMD FT in 1939. These successful diesel locomotives showed that diesel power was superior to steam, due to lower costs, ease of maintenance, and better reliability. Meanwhile, Italy developed an extensive network of electric trains during the first decades of the 20th century, driven by that country's lack of significant coal reserves.\n\n\n=== Dieselization and increased competition ===\nWorld War II brought great destruction to existing railroads across Europe, Asia, and Africa. Following the war's conclusion in 1945, nations which had suffered extensive damage to their railroad networks took the opportunity provided by Marshall Plan funds (or economic assistance from the USSR and Comecon, for nations behind the Iron Curtain) and advances in technology to convert their trains to diesel or electric power. France, Russia, Switzerland, and Japan were leaders in adopting widespread electrified railroads, while other nations focused primarily on dieselization. By 1980, the majority of the world's steam locomotives had been retired, though they continued to be used in parts of Africa and Asia, along with a few holdouts in Europe and South America. China was the last country to fully dieselize, due to its abundant coal reserves; steam locomotives were used to haul mainline trains as late as 2005 in Inner Mongolia.Trains began to face strong competition from automobiles and freight trucks in the 1930s, which greatly intensified following World War II. After the war, air transport also became a significant competitor for passenger trains. Large amounts of traffic shifted to these new forms of transportation, resulting in a widespread decline in train service, both freight and passenger. A new development in the 1960s was high-speed rail, which runs on dedicated rights of way and travels at speeds of 240 kilometers per hour (150 mph) or greater. The first high-speed rail service was the Japanese Shinkansen, which entered service in 1964. In the following decades, high speed rail networks were developed across much of Europe and Eastern Asia, providing fast and reliable service competitive with automobiles and airplanes. The first high-speed train in the Americas was Amtrak's Acela in the United States, which entered service in 2000.\n\n\n=== To the present day ===\nTowards the end of the 20th century, increased awareness of the benefits of trains for transport led to a revival in their use and importance. Freight trains are significantly more efficient than trucks, while also emitting far fewer greenhouse gas emissions per ton-mile; passenger trains are also far more energy efficient than other modes of transport. According to the International Energy Agency, \"On average, rail requires 12 times less energy and emits 7-11 times less GHGs per passenger-km travelled than private vehicles and airplanes, making it the most efficient mode of motorised passenger transport. Aside from shipping, freight rail is the most energy-efficient and least carbon-intensive way to transport goods.\" As such, rail transport is considered an important part of achieving sustainable energy. Intermodal freight trains, carrying double-stack shipping containers, have since the 1970s generated significant business for railroads and gained market share from trucks. Increased use of commuter rail has also been promoted as a means of fighting traffic congestion on highways in urban areas.\n\n\n== Types and terminology ==\n\nTrains can be sorted into types based on whether they haul passengers or freight (though mixed trains which haul both exist), by their weight (heavy rail for regular trains, light rail for lighter rapid transit systems), by their speed, and by what form of track they use. Conventional trains operate on two rails, but several other types of track systems are also in use around the world.\n\n\n=== Terminology ===\nThe railway terminology that is used to describe a train varies between countries. The two primary systems of terminology are International Union of Railways terms in much of the world, and Association of American Railroads terms in North America.Trains are typically defined as one or more locomotives coupled together, with or without cars. A collection of rail vehicles may also be called a consist. A set of vehicles that are permanently or semi-permanently coupled together (such as the Pioneer Zephyr) is called a trainset. The term rolling stock is used to describe any kind of train vehicle.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\n\n=== Bogies ===\n\nBogies, also known in North America as trucks, support the wheels and axles of trains. Trucks range from just one axle to as many as four or more. Two axle trucks are in the widest use worldwide, as they are better able to handle curves and support heavy loads than single axle trucks.\n\n\n=== Couplers ===\n\nTrain vehicles are linked to one another by various systems of coupling. In much of Europe, India, and South America, trains primarily use buffers and chain couplers, while in the rest of the world knuckle couplers are used.\n\n\n=== Brakes ===\n\nBecause trains are heavy, powerful brakes are needed to slow or stop trains, and because steel wheels on steel rails have relatively low friction, brakes must be distributed among as many wheels as possible. Early trains could only be stopped by manually applied hand brakes, requiring workers to ride on top of the cars and apply the brakes when the train went downhill. Hand brakes are still used to park cars and locomotives, but the predominant braking system for trains globally is air brakes, invented in 1869 by George Westinghouse. Air brakes are applied at once to the entire train using air hoses.\n\n\n=== Warning devices ===\n\nFor safety and communication, trains are equipped with bells, horns, and lights. Steam locomotives typically use steam whistles rather than horns. Other types of lights may be installed on locomotives and cars, such as classification lights, Mars Lights, and ditch lights.\n\n\n=== Cabs ===\nLocomotives are in most cases equipped with cabs, also known as driving compartments, where a train driver controls the train's operation. They may also be installed on unpowered train cars known as cab or control cars, to allow for a train to operate with the locomotive at the rear.\n\n\n== Operations ==\n\n\n=== Scheduling and dispatching ===\nTo prevent collisions or other accidents, trains are often scheduled, and almost always are under the control of train dispatchers. Historically, trains operated based on timetables; most passenger trains continue to operate based on fixed schedules, though freight trains may instead run on an as-needed basis, or when enough freight cars are available to justify running a train.\n\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n\nSimple repairs may be done while a train is parked on the tracks, but more extensive repairs will be done at a motive power depot. Similar facilities exist for repairing damaged or defective train cars. Maintenance of way trains are used to build and repair railroad tracks and other equipment.\n\n\n=== Crew ===\nTrain drivers, also known as engineers, are responsible for operating trains. Conductors are in charge of trains and their cargo, and help passengers on passenger trains. Brakeman, also known as trainmen, were historically responsible for manually applying brakes, though the term is used today to refer to crew members who perform tasks such as operating switches, coupling and uncoupling train cars, and setting handbrakes on equipment. Steam locomotives require a fireman who is responsible for fueling and regulating the locomotive's fire and boiler. On passenger trains, other crew members assist passengers, such as chefs to prepare food, and service attendants to provide food and drinks to passengers. Other passenger train specific duties include passenger car attendants, who assist passengers with boarding and alighting from trains, answer questions, and keep train cars clean, and sleeping car attendants, who perform similar duties in sleeping cars.\n\n\n=== Gauge ===\n\nAround the world, various track gauges are in use for trains. In most cases, trains can only operate on tracks that are of the same gauge; where different gauge trains meet, it is known as a break of gauge. Standard gauge, defined as 1,435 mm (4 ft 8.5 in) between the rails, is the most common gauge worldwide, though both broad-gauge and narrow-gauge trains are also in use. Trains also need to fit within the loading gauge profile to avoid fouling bridges and lineside infrastructure with this being a potential limiting factor on loads such as intermodal container types that may be carried.\n\n\n== Safety ==\n\nTrain accidents sometimes occur, including derailments (when a train leaves the tracks) and train wrecks (collisions between trains). Accidents were more common in the early days of trains, when railway signal systems, centralized traffic control, and failsafe systems to prevent collisions were primitive or did not yet exist. To prevent accidents, systems such as automatic train stop are used; these are failsafe systems that apply the brakes on a train if it passes a red signal and enters an occupied block, or if any of the train's equipment malfunctions. More advanced safety systems, such as positive train control, can also automatically regulate train speed, preventing derailments from entering curves or switches too fast.Modern trains have a very good safety record overall, comparable with air travel. In the United States between 2000 and 2009, train travel averaged 0.43 deaths per billion passenger miles traveled. While this was higher than that of air travel at 0.07 deaths per billion passenger miles, it was also far below the 7.28 deaths per billion passenger miles of car travel. In the 21st century, several derailments of oil trains caused fatalities, most notably the Canadian Lac-M\u00e9gantic rail disaster in 2013 which killed 47 people and leveled much of the town of Lac-M\u00e9gantic.The vast majority of train-related fatalities, over 90 percent, are due to trespassing on railroad tracks, or collisions with road vehicles at level crossings. Organizations such as Operation Lifesaver have been formed to improve safety awareness at railroad crossings, and governments have also launched ad campaigns. Trains cannot stop quickly when at speed; even an emergency brake application may still require more than a mile of stopping distance. As such, emphasis is on educating motorists to yield to trains at crossings and avoid trespassing.\n\n\n== Motive power ==\n\n\n=== Before steam ===\nThe first trains were rope-hauled, gravity powered or pulled by horses.\n\n\n=== Steam ===\nSteam locomotives work by using a boiler to heat water into steam, which powers the locomotive's pistons which are in turn connected to the wheels. In the mid 20th century, most steam locomotives were replaced by diesel or electric locomotives, which were cheaper, cleaner, and more reliable. Steam locomotives are still used in heritage railways operated in many countries for the leisure and enthusiast market.\n\n\n=== Diesel ===\nDiesel locomotives are powered with a diesel engine, which generates electricity to drive traction motors. This is known as a diesel\u2013electric transmission, and is used on almost all diesels. Diesel power replaced steam for a variety of reasons: diesel locomotives were less complex, far more reliable, cheaper, cleaner, easier to maintain, and more fuel efficient.\n\n\n=== Electric ===\nElectric trains receive their current via overhead lines or through a third rail electric system, which is then used to power traction motors that drive the wheels. Electric traction offers a lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, which can only be justified on high traffic lines. Even though the cost per mile of construction is much higher, electric traction is cheaper to operate thanks to lower maintenance and purchase costs for locomotives and equipment. Compared to diesel locomotives, electric locomotives produce no direct emissions and accelerate much faster, making them better suited to passenger service, especially underground.\n\n\n=== Other types ===\n\nVarious other types of train propulsion have been tried, some more successful than others.\nIn the mid 1900s, gas turbine locomotives were developed and successfully used, though most were retired due to high fuel costs and poor reliability.In the 21st century, alternative fuels for locomotives are under development, due to increasing costs for diesel and a desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from trains. Examples include hydrail (trains powered by hydrogen fuel cells) and the use of compressed or liquefied natural gas.\n\n\n== Train cars ==\n\nTrain cars, also known as wagons, are unpowered rail vehicles which are typically pulled by locomotives. Many different types exist, specialized to handle various types of cargo. Some common types include boxcars (also known as covered goods wagons) that carry a wide variety of cargo, flatcars (also known as flat wagons) which have flat tops to hold cargo, hopper cars which carry bulk commodities, and tank cars which carry liquids and gases. Examples of more specialized types of train cars include bottle cars which hold molten steel, Schnabel cars which handle very heavy loads, and refrigerator cars which carry perishable goods.Early train cars were small and light, much like early locomotives, but over time they have become larger as locomotives have become more powerful.\n\n\n== Passenger trains ==\n\nA passenger train is used to transport people along a railroad line. These trains may consist of unpowered passenger railroad cars (also known as coaches or carriages) hauled by one or more locomotives, or may be self-propelled; self propelled passenger trains are known as multiple units or railcars. Passenger trains travel between stations or depots, where passengers may board and disembark. In most cases, passenger trains operate on a fixed schedule and have priority over freight trains.Passenger trains can be divided into short and long distance services.\n\n\n=== Long distance trains ===\n\nLong distance passenger trains travel over hundreds or even thousands of miles between cities. The longest passenger train service in the world is Russia's Trans-Siberian Railway between Moscow and Vladivostok, a distance of 9,289 kilometers (5,772 mi). In general, long distance trains may take days to complete their journeys, and stop at dozens of stations along their routes. For many rural communities, they are the only form of public transportation available.\n\n\n=== Short distance trains ===\nShort distance or regional passenger trains have travel times measured in hours or even minutes, as opposed to days. They run more frequently than long distance trains, and are often used by commuters. Short distance passenger trains specifically designed for commuters are known as commuter rail.\n\n\n=== High speed trains ===\n\nHigh speed trains are designed to be much faster than conventional trains, and typically run on their own separate tracks than other, slower trains. The first high speed train was the Japanese Shinkansen, which opened in 1964. In the 21st century, services such as the French TGV and German Intercity Express are competitive with airplanes in travel time over short to medium distances.A subset of high speed trains are higher speed trains, which bridge the gap between conventional and high speed trains, and travel at speeds between the two. Examples include the Northeast Regional in the United States, the Gatimaan Express in India, and the KTM ETS in Malaysia.\n\n\n== Rapid transit trains ==\nA number of types of trains are used to provide rapid transit to urban areas. These are distinct from traditional passenger trains in that they operate more frequently, typically do not share tracks with freight trains, and cover relatively short distances. Many different kinds of systems are in use globally.Rapid transit trains that operate in tunnels below ground are known as subways, undergrounds, or metros. Elevated railways operate on viaducts or bridges above the ground, often on top of city streets. \"Metro\" may also refer to rapid transit that operates at ground level. In many systems, two or even all three of these types may exist on different portions of a network. \n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTrams, also known in North America as streetcars, typically operate on or parallel to streets in cities, with frequent stops and a high frequency of service.\n\n\n=== Light rail ===\n\nLight rail is a catchall term for a variety of systems, which may include characteristics of trams, passenger trains, and rapid transit systems.\n\n\n== Specialized trains ==\nThere are a number of specialized trains which differ from the traditional definition of a train as a set of vehicles which travels on two rails.\n\n\n=== Monorail ===\n\nMonorails were developed to meet medium-demand traffic in urban transit, and consist of a train running on a single rail, typically elevated. Monorails represent a small proportion of the train systems in use worldwide. Almost all monorail trains use linear induction motors.\n\n\n=== Maglev ===\n\nTo achieve much faster operation over 500 kilometers per hour (310 mph), maglev technology has been researched since the early 20th century. The technology uses magnets to levitate the train above the track, reducing friction and allowing higher speeds. The first commercial maglev train was an airport shuttle introduced in 1984 at Birmingham Airport in England.The Shanghai Maglev Train, opened in 2003, is the fastest commercial train service of any kind, operating at speeds of up to 430 km/h (270 mph). Japan's L0 Series maglev holds the record for the world's fastest train ever, with a top speed of 603.0 kilometers per hour (374.7 mph). Maglev has not yet been used for inter-city mass transit routes, with only a few examples in use worldwide as of 2021.\n\n\n=== Mine trains ===\n\nMine trains are operated in large mines and carry both workers and goods. They are usually powered by electricity, to prevent emissions which would pose a health risk to workers underground.\n\n\n=== Militarized trains ===\n\nWhile they have long been important in transporting troops and military equipment, trains have occasionally been used for direct combat. Armored trains have been used in a number of conflicts, as have railroad based artillery systems. Railcar-launched ICBM systems have also been used by nuclear weapon states.\n\n\n=== Rack railway ===\n\nFor climbing steep slopes, specialized rack railroads are used. In order to avoid slipping, a rack and pinion system is used, with a toothed rail placed between the two regular rails, which meshes with a drive gear under the locomotive.\n\n\n=== Funicular ===\n\nFuniculars are also used to climb steep slopes, but instead of a rack use a rope, which is attached to two cars and a pulley. The two funicular cars travel up and down the slope on parallel sets of rails when the pulley is rotated. This design makes funiculars an efficient means of moving people and cargo up and down slopes. The earliest funicular railroad, the Reisszug, opened around 1500.\n\n\n== Freight trains ==\nFreight trains are dedicated to the transport of cargo (also known as goods), rather than people, and are made up of freight cars or wagons. Longer freight trains typically operate between classification yards, while local trains provide freight service between yards and individual loading and unloading points along railroad lines. Major origin or destination points for freight may instead be served by unit trains, which exclusively carry one type of cargo and move directly from the origin to the destination and back without any intermediate stops.Under the right circumstances, transporting freight by train is less expensive than other modes of transport, and also more energy efficient than transporting freight by road. In the United States, railroads on average moved a ton of freight 702 kilometers (436 mi) per gallon of fuel, as of 2008, an efficiency four times greater than that of trucks. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute estimates that train transportation of freight is between 1.9 and 5.5 times more efficient than by truck, and also generates significantly less pollution. Rail freight is most economic when goods are being carried in bulk and over large distances, but it is less suited to short distances and small loads. With the advent of containerization, freight rail has become part of an intermodal freight network linked with trucking and container ships.The main disadvantage of rail freight is its lack of flexibility and for this reason, rail has lost much of the freight business to road competition. Many governments are trying to encourage more freight back on to trains because of the community benefits that it would bring.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\nFrom the dawn of railroading, trains have had a significant cultural impact worldwide. Fast train travel made possible in days or hours journeys which previously took months. Transport of both freight and passengers became far cheaper, allowing for networked economies over large areas. Towns and cities along railroad lines grew in importance, while those bypassed declined or even became ghost towns. Major cities such as Chicago became prominent because they were places where multiple train lines met. In the United States, the completion of the first transcontinental railroad played a major role in the settling of the western part of the nation by non-indigenous migrants and its incorporation into the rest of the country. The Russian Trans-Siberian Railway had a similar impact by connecting the vast country from east to west, and making travel across the frozen Siberia possible.Trains have long had a major influence on music, art, and literature. Many films heavily involve or are set on trains. Toy train sets are commonly used by children, traditionally boys. Railfans are found around the world, along with hobbyists who create model train layouts. Train enthusiasts generally have a positive relationship with the railroad industry, though sometimes cause issues by trespassing.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of railway companies\nLists of named passenger trains\nLists of rail accidents\nOverview of train systems by country\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nGlancey, Jonathan (2005).

    "Charlotte Taylor Blow Charless": "Charlotte Taylor Blow Charless (1810\u20131905) founded the \"Home of the Friendless\" in St. Louis in 1853 for elderly, indigent women who could no longer work and care for themselves. Renamed \u201cThe Charless Home\" in 1977, the institution celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2003 and continues to provide housing and services to retired men (since 1996) as well as women.\nMrs. Charless wrote a biography of her husband, Joseph Charless, Jr. (1804-1859) to extol his exemplary moral and Christian character. Her husband, a prominent merchant and banker, was assassinated in St. Louis by a deranged bookkeeper, Joseph Thornton, who believed that Charless had ruined his character by testifying against him at trial.  Thornton, accused of stealing nearly $20,000 from the Boatmen\u2019s Saving Association, was acquitted of theft, but found guilty of murder. Mrs. Charless's biography, written as a series of letters to her grandchildren, was privately printed and published in St. Louis in 1869.\nBorn in Southampton County, Virginia, Mrs. Charless traveled with her family first to northern Alabama and then, in 1830, to St. Louis where her father, Peter Blow (1777 -1832), briefly operated a hotel. At the time of his death, he or his family sold their slave Dred Scott (ca.1799-1858) to Colonel John Emerson, who took Scott to the \u201cfree\u201d state of Illinois and territory of Wisconsin. When Scott returned to St. Louis in 1842, he sued for his freedom. Scott found moral and monetary support from Charlotte Charless, her husband and her brothers Henry and Taylor Blow. After Scott's final appeal to the United States Supreme Court failed in 1857, Colonel Emerson's widow, by then married to a leading abolitionist, transferred ownership of Scott to Taylor Blow.

    "Ni Hao, Kai-Lan": "Ni Hao, Kai-Lan is a 2D flash-animated (anime-influenced) children's television series produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio. It began as a series of three interstitial shorts on Nick Jr. called Downward Doghouse. The first full episode was initially set to premiere in fall 2007 on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block in the United States, but it was delayed to February 7, 2008, coinciding with the first day of the Chinese New Year.Ni Hao, Kai-Lan is based on childhood memories of the show's creator, Karen Chau, who grew up in a bicultural (Chinese-American) household. \"Ni hao\" (\u4f60\u597d n\u01d0 h\u01ceo) means \"Hello\" in Mandarin, and Kai-Lan (\u51ef\u5170 K\u01ceil\u00e1n) is the Chinese name Chau was given at birth, which was later anglicized to Karen.\n40 episodes over two seasons were produced. Sascha Paladino was the head writer and developer for the show.\n\n\n== Premise ==\nThe series follows the adventures of Kai-Lan and her group of talking anthropomorphic animal companions. The group consists of Kai-Lan, a six-year-old Chinese-American girl; Rintoo, a yellow tiger; Tolee, a gray koala; Lulu, a light pink rhino; and Hoho, a white monkey. Each episode is based around a series of events that occur during Kai-Lan's day, along with obstacles that she and her friends are forced to overcome (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, playing games, and working together. Common rituals may involve Kai-Lan resolving conflicts from her friends when they feel negative emotions. To help them, Kai-Lan has the audience help her figure out why they are having difficult situations. Usually, once Kai-Lan's friends discover that their actions are wrong, they apologize and promise to work together better. The audience is usually presented with two musical sing-alongs where Kai-Lan sings about what must be done to overcome her and her friends' challenges. The episode always ends with Kai-Lan successfully helping her friends and everyone getting along. In the Season 1 finale, it is stated that they all live in California. \nOther aspects generally featured in episodes are breaking the fourth wall, 11 minutes of interactivity, a target word that is repeated multiple times, a few words of Mandarin Chinese vocabulary, and before saying goodbye (at the end of each episode), Kai-lan says, \"You make my heart feel super happy!\" Later installments added Kai-lan saying this phrase in Mandarin after she said it in English: \"Ni rang wo hao kai xin!\" Ni Hao, Kai-lan introduces its viewers to the Mandarin Chinese language, along with elements of Chinese culture and values, and intergenerational families (e.g., Kai-lan and her relationship with Ye Ye).\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== Kai-Lan ===\nKai-Lan (voiced by Jade Lianna Peters) is a playful, adventurous young girl with a big heart.

    "Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook": "In shogi, the Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook (\u89d2\u4ea4\u63db\u56db\u9593\u98db\u8eca kaku k\u014dkan shikenbisha) or Open Bishop Diagonal Fourth File Rook (\u89d2\u9053\u30aa\u30fc\u30d7\u30f3\u56db\u9593\u98db\u8eca kaku michi \u014dpun shikenbisha) is a Fourth File Rook (Ranging Rook) opening in which the player's bishop diagonal remains open allowing for a bishop exchange to occur early in the opening. Following the bishop exchange, the rook is moved to the Fourth File.\nThis contrasts with the defensive so-called normal or standard Fourth File Rook that keeps the bishop diagonal closed until the player is ready for a counterattack so that they may avoid rough and tumble battles initiated by their opponent. (See: Types of Ranging Rook.)\nAlthough it's labelled a Fourth File Rook opening, thanks to the bishop exchange the rook can easily switch to the 8th file (for Black) or to the 2nd file (for White), and hence it also keeps some strong elements of Opposing Rook openings.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn a typical static rook vs. ranging rook game, ranging rook defends from static rook's rook pawn by way of the power of the bishop. In this situation then, with a bishop exchange the rook's pawn can break through and in consequence ranging rook will be at a disadvantage (hence the proverb, \"Aim for a bishop exchange against ranging rook\"). For this reason ranging rook will attempt to block the bishop's diagonal early, and will enter battle as soon as the king is castled. In Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook, instead, the bishop's diagonal remains open and the development of the opening occurs following the bishop exchange.\nWhen White (gote) is the one playing ranging rook, the rook moves to 42 without closing the bishop's diagonal. After that, of course, the bishops will be exchanged, and it's possible that the rook will move to the second file, aiming to counterattack against Black's rook pawn.\nAccording to professional player Hirokazu Ueno, this opening has three characteristics. First, thanks to the bishop exchange Black doesn't need to worry for an attack on the bishop's head. Second, the tendency to go for a slow game is strong. Finally, it can be used when playing Black or White. In addition, since ranging rook's natural enemy at large is Static Rook's Bear-in-the-hole castle, with the bishop exchange the horse has to be taken by the silver, which means that static rook won't be able to build Bear-in-the-hole without losing one tempo. Furthermore, even if Bear-in-the-hole is built up, since it makes the silver and golds to lean heavily on one side it becomes really easy for ranging rook to find good places to drop the bishop in hand, and even against the solidness of a Mino castle it becomes easy to wage battle, hence the ranging rook is at advantage.\nMoreover, since White's R-42 places the rook temporarily in the fourth file, it becomes a preparation for a powerful counterattack against Black's B*6e. However, this results of course in the waste of one move, and this isn't necessarily satisfactory. Nevertheless, research has shown that there is no problem even if the Black's bishop is dropped at B*6e, thanks to a development by which rook can then move to the 2nd file and hence turn into a Direct Opposing Rook, which became really popular between 2011 and 2013.\nAn opening to build Bear-in-the-hole from Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook has also been created, the so called Leghorn Special (\u767d\u8272\u30ec\u30b0\u30db\u30f3\u30fb\u30b9\u30da\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb hakushoku reguhon supesharu or, most commonly, the abbreviation \u30ec\u30b0\u30b9\u30da regusupe).\n\n\n== Craze and K\u014dz\u014d Masuda Award ==\nChikako Nagasawa had been playing Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook in female tournaments since 2000, and Nagasawa's fellow countryman K\u014dichi Kinoshita played it frequently in male tournaments since around 2002. Later on, it started attracting attention when Yoshiyuki Ueyama won against Hiroyuki Miura by using this opening. In addition, according to Ueno, Takeshi Fujii had been exploring novel countermeasures against Anaguma to replace the Fujii System when this opening made its appearance in the world of professional shogi after being popular among college players, and his adoption of the opening caught a lot of attention and produced a craze for the strategy in the subsequent years. Fujii went on to receive the K\u014dz\u014d Masuda Award for his use of this strategy in 2013.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n1. P-76 P-34. The most common first two moves in shogi: bishop diagonals are opened.\n2. R-68. Black swings their rook to the sixth file on their second turn. This is the characteristic of Bishop Exchange Fourth File Rook. \nTraditional Fourth File Rook Instead would have closed their bishop diagonal (2. P-66) in order to prevent White from trading bishops at an inopportune time.\n\nWhite exchanging pawns on the eighth file is a blunder.\n\n\n=== Blunder: Static Rook's early rook pawn exchange ===\nThe Static Rook's early rook pawn exchange is a blunder.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFourth File Rook\nQuick Ishida\nCheerful Central Rook\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\u4e0a\u91ce\u88d5\u548c (2014), NHK\u5c06\u68cb\u8b1b\u5ea7 2014\u5e749\u6708\u53f7 \u5225\u518a\u4ed8\u9332 \u4e0a\u91ce\u88d5\u548c\u306eNHK\u676f\u306e\u5e8f\u76e4\u304c\u308f\u304b\u308b!

    "Ur-Quan": "The Ur-Quan are a fictional race of predatory alien caterpillars in the Star Control series of video games, created by Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford. Introduced in 1990, the Ur-Quan are the primary antagonist of the first game, leading a galactic empire that seeks to enslave Earth. They reprise their role in Star Control II, which expands on their history as former slaves who since vowed to fiercely defend themselves. During the game, the Ur-Quan enter into a civil war over their ideology, giving Earth an opportunity to defeat them. In Star Control 3, which was developed by a different team, the Ur-Quan ally with Earth against a different antagonist and their role is scaled back. They appear once again in The Ur-Quan Masters, the 2002 open source remake of Star Control II.\nReiche and Ford developed the Ur-Quan based on the concepts for unique spaceships in Star Control; their insectoid appearance was inspired by a National Geographic photo of a caterpillar. Their role in Star Control II has earned acclaim among the best game villains of all time, praised for their menacing persona, as well as their surprising depth and humanity. The Ur-Quan have also influenced other game studios, inspiring concepts in games such as Mass Effect and Stellaris.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Ur-Quan are fictional characters in the Star Control series of video games, appearing as an alien race of giant predatory caterpillars. Their history is revealed through character dialog, which describes them as a species who evolved on a harsh planet in a distant region of space. Their biological lineage is compared to solitary predators such as the praying mantis, who are naturally limited in their social behaviors. As the Ur-Quan developed intelligence and culture, they were able to master their fierce territorial and hunting instincts, and build a co-operative spacefaring civilization.Thousands of years before Star Control, the Ur-Quan were discovered by a psychic race called the Dnyarri, who enslaved the Ur-Quan and compelled them to dominate the rest of known space. Using genetic engineering, the Dnyarri separated the original brown Ur-Quan into two sub-species. The green Ur-Quan became the Dnyarri's favored administrators and researchers, and the black Ur-Quan became their designated soldiers. Many generations later, the Ur-Quan led a successful slave revolt. They discovered they could break the Dnyarri's psychic compulsion by torturing themselves, giving them enough time to kill and eventually exterminate their Dnyarri oppressors.The Ur-Quan vowed they would never again be slaves, and began to conquer all other intelligent life in the galaxy. The green Ur-Quan were renamed the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za in honor of the Ur-Quan scientist who freed them all. The Kzer-Za moved forward with the 'Path of Now and Forever', a policy of security through enslaving all non-Ur-Quan sentient life, controlling them as either 'battle thralls', or as 'fallow slaves' forever imprisoned on their home worlds under impenetrable force-fields. The Black Ur-Quan, renamed the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah after their new leader, felt that they could only be safe with the complete annihilation of all non-Ur-Quan life, an ideology they called the 'Eternal Doctrine'. The differing doctrines of the two fiercely territorial species escalated into a civil war. After devastating losses, the Kzer-Za eventually triumphed through the discovery of an enormous ancient battleship created by a lost alien civilization called the Precursors.\n\n\n=== Appearances ===\nThe Star Control games are set in the 22nd century, with the player defending humanity from the Ur-Quan Hierarchy, an empire of alien races enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The original Star Control is an action-strategy game, telling a simple story about a war between two alliances, with the Ur-Quan seeking to enslave Earth and its allies. Star Control II greatly expands on the fiction and characters from the first game, allowing the player to learn the Ur-Quan's deeper history and motivations. The sequel begins by revealing that the Ur-Quan succeeded in enslaving their enemies, with planet Earth imprisoned under a Slave Shield. The story slowly reveals that the Ur-Quan are preoccupied with their 'Second Doctrinal Conflict', a civil war to determine who should hold the moral authority to impose their will on the galaxy. At the climax of Star Control II, the Ur-Quan are defeated when a bomb destroys their ancient Precursor battleship. However, Star Control II can also end with the Kohr-Ah faction winning their civil war, allowing them to annihilate every alien race in the region, one-by-one.The Ur-Quan have a minor role in Star Control 3, which was created by a different development team. The game starts with the Ur-Quan joining an alliance with Earth, but they are ultimately undermined by another civil war with the Kohr-Ah. They are also featured in The Ur-Quan Masters, the official open source remake of Star Control II.\n\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n\nCreators Paul Reiche III and Fred Ford first conceived of the Ur-Quan for the original Star Control. Reiche and Ford began with paper illustrations, which led them to implement ships with special abilities, with each character concept inspired by each ship's unique look-and-feel. Reiche described their character creation process: \"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them. I hold little conversations with them. 'What do you guys do?' And they tell me\". One large spaceship had the ability to launch fighters, and this ship led the designers to a creative conclusion  \u2013 since these aliens had command over others, they should be a powerful ancient race that plays the role of the lead antagonist. Reiche and Ford felt that the word \"Ur-\" had ancient connotations, and liked the sound of \"Quan\", and thus the Ur-Quan were created.\nThe first Star Control's story was mainly written in the instruction manual, describing the Ur-Quan as founders of an evil Hierarchy, a \"rigid union of the ancient Ur-Quan slavers and their minions\". Reiche and Ford wrote the Ur-Quan's motivations for galactic dominance as their desire for slaves. Reiche had previously created a mantis-inspired race called the Thri-Kreen for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, and the mantis continued to inspire the creation of Star Control's insectoid species. When Reiche saw a National Geographic image of a predatory caterpillar dangling over its prey, this became the basis for the Ur-Quan's appearance. The origins of Star Control II were motivated by the designers' interest in expanding on the first game's story. As they began writing the new game, Reiche and Ford used the first game's characters to tell simple visual stories about their fictional conflicts. Their intention was to develop aliens who were exaggerations of human flaws, personalities, and cultures. The Ur-Quan were already understood as a race of slavers in Star Control, so the writers developed their motivation by imagining them as former slaves themselves. Reiche attempted to humanize the Ur-Quan, based on his own \"relationships with people who had experienced significant childhood abuse and how those traumas produced distinctly odd behaviors in adults. [The Ur-Quan's] doctrines were the overtly crazy but internally reasonable responses to their treatment by the Dnyarri, and the pain they had to endure to win their freedom from slavery\". The team describes this writing process as imagining justifications for past creative decisions, building logically on details about the Ur-Quan's history, artwork, and game abilities.The Ur-Quan theme music for Star Control II was created by fantasy artist Erol Otus, who first composed the song on a synthesizer before it was re-sampled and exported to MOD file format. The 3DO version of Star Control II features the voice of Larry Zee for the Ur-Quan Kzer-Za, and David Bryce for the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\nThe Ur-Quan have been described among the best villains in video games. In 1999, GameSpot ranked the Ur-Quan as their best villain in gaming, explaining how their \"masochistic and truly sad history makes the Ur-Quan one of the very best villains. Even now, we are hard-pressed to find a race of adversaries as complex and three-dimensional\". This mirrored their reader-voted awards, where fans chose them as the fourth greatest game villains. Richard Cobbett of Rock, Paper, Shotgun declared them a \"galactic threat better than basically any science fiction role-playing video game that came after\", praising the writers for developing the antagonist's motives and justifications. Game historian Rusel DeMaria also proclaimed the Ur-Quan as one of the all-time villainous races in gaming history. The A.V. Club included the Ur-Quan in their 2021 list of best aliens in pop culture, describing them as \"tremendous sci-fi villains, importing heady old-school concepts into Star Control\u2019s relentlessly fun space-based action\". Noting their overall impact on the game industry, Hardcore Gaming 101 agreed that the Ur-Quan are \"rightfully ranked among gaming's greatest villains\", as \"their terrible history evokes a classic sympathy for the devil, a dramatic moment that many authors only hope to achieve.\"The Ur-Quan remain an iconic part of what made Star Control II a success. GameSpot further celebrated the Ur-Quan for their role in Star Control II as one of the best game endings, and GameSpot readers frequently proclaimed their role in one of the best game settings. The Red Bull Gaming channel also highlighted the Ur-Quan's importance to the classic setting of Star Control II. AllGame hailed the game as a \"masterpiece\" for its story, explaining how \"the Ur-Quan, ostensibly the major villains, [...] become more sympathetic than most of the friendly-but-fluttery allies populating your own fleet. This is a rare and praiseworthy design achievement.\"In addition, the Ur-Quan have been acclaimed for their music and audio design. Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 described how the music of Star Control II gives each alien race a stronger personality, particularly the Ur-Quan's foreboding theme. This similarly led GameSpot to rank the Star Control II soundtrack as the second greatest of all time, as \"these themes were as diverse as the aliens' appearances. Your Green Ur-Quan masters had a commanding, pounding beat, while their more sinister brothers, the Black Ur-Quan, had a more menacing and subtle theme\". John  Szczepaniak of Retro Gamer praised the Ur-Quan's voice acting and dialog, including the \"absolute dread caused by hearing in-depth explanations of what it's like to wear a 'pain excruciator'\".Star Control 3 was developed and written by a different team. Kurt Kalata felt that the game failed to give the Ur-Quan a meaningful role, though he praised their transformation from antagonist to ally. Similarly, Niko Nirvi of Pelit commented that Star Control 3 lacked an enemy as compelling as the Ur-Quan Kohr-Ah.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nStar Control II has inspired several game studios, where the Ur-Quan have influenced some of the most successful space titles. With several Star Control II fans at Paradox Interactive, their space strategy game Stellaris offers the ability to encase a planet in a slave shield, and references the Ur-Quan's battle thralls as a policy option. Star Control II has also been noted as an influence on Mass Effect writers Mike Laidlaw and Patrick Weekes. The game had an impact on Laidlaw's formative years, and he later praised the Ur-Quan as one of the game's compelling mysteries. BioWare co-founder Ray Muzyka has also credited Star Control as an inspiration for the Mass Effect series. Journalists have since noted the design similarities between the Ur-Quan and Mass Effect's Reapers.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Ur-Quan Masters, the authorized free version of Star Control II",

    "1947 Western Australian state election": "Elections were held in the state of Western Australia on 15 March 1947 to elect all 50 members to the Legislative Assembly. The result was a hung parliament\u2014the four-term Labor government, led by Premier Frank Wise, was defeated with a swing of approximately 7%. The Liberal-Country Coalition won exactly half of the seats, one short of a majority, needed the support of the Independent members Harry Shearn and William Read to govern.\nThe election was the Liberal Party's first major showing since its formation in 1944-1945 out of the former Nationalist Party. Coincidental with this, in 1944, was the significant change in the fortunes of the Country Party when the Primary Producers' Association, of which the Party had been the political wing, passed a motion during negotiations with the Wheatgrowers' Union deleting the rule which authorised the Party's existence and its use of PPA branches and funds for party purposes. A new organisation, was hastily set up by the Opposition Leader Arthur Watts and the member for Pingelly, Harrie Seward, who were very active in setting up branches to endorse local candidates and obtaining donations on which to run the 1947 campaign. \nDespite leading the Opposition prior to the election Country Party leader Watts did not become Premier with the change of government. The Country Party had been the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition for most of the 1930s and 1940s. However, the election saw the Country Party win one fewer seat than the Liberals. As a result, Liberal leader Ross McLarty became Premier, with Watts as his deputy. It is one instance in which an Opposition leader did not become Premier with an election producing a change of government. This was the start of a significant decline in the Country Party's fortunes over the ensuing decades; the party, now the WA Nationals, has never won more than nine seats at an election since.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n1  297,089 electors were enrolled to vote at the election, but 20 seats (40% of the total) were uncontested\u201415 Labor seats (four more than 1943) representing 71,732 enrolled voters, 2 Liberal seats (one more than the Nationalists in 1943) representing 12,765 voters, 2 Country seats representing 8,678 voters, and one Independent Nationalist seat representing 9,644 voters.\n2  The figure for the Independent Nationalist label is likely to be artificially low as the successful candidate for Maylands, Harry Shearn, won unopposed. He won the seat under the same label with 4,966 votes in 1939, 4,342 votes in 1943 and 5,060 votes in 1950.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMembers of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 1943\u20131947\nMembers of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, 1947\u20131950\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Roman Catholic Diocese of Dromore": "The Diocese of Dromore is a Roman Catholic diocese in Northern Ireland. It is one of eight suffragan dioceses which are subject to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Armagh.The diocese is currently sede vacante. The most recent Bishop was the Most Reverend John McAreavey who received his episcopal consecration in 1999.\n\n\n== Geographical remit ==\nThe geographical remit of the see includes portions of the counties of Down, Armagh and Antrim which are all situated in Northern Ireland. Large population centres in the diocese include Newry, Banbridge, Craigavon, Lurgan and Warrenpoint. The bishop's seat (cathedra) is in the cathedral church of SS Patrick and Colman, Newry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nThe monastery of Dromore is believed to have been founded in the sixth century by St Colman (called also Mocholm\u00f3c), probably the first Abbot of Dromore. The first building was a small wattle and daub church on the northern bank of the River Lagan. The Diocese of Dromore was established through the reorganisation of the Irish Church in the late 12th century, possibly at the synod held in Dublin in 1192 by the papal legate, M\u00fairges Ua h\u00c9nna, Archbishop of Cashel. The diocese coincided with the territory of the U\u00ed Echach Cobo, which later became the baronies of Upper and Lower Iveagh, and the lordship of Newry, County Down.\n\n\n=== Post-Reformation ===\nDuring the 16th century Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church lost control of the old cathedral in Dromore to the Protestant Church of Ireland, which was wholly destroyed during the rebellion of 1641 and rebuilt twenty years later.\nIn the 19th century, the Church chose the site of a new cathedral at Newry, the largest town of County Down, and a place of significant ecclesiastical importance as the site of an ancient monastery, situated at the head of Carlingford Lough. Work for building of Newry Cathedral begun in 1823 and was completed in 1829  by Dr. Michael Blake (bishop of Dromore 1833\u20131860) who had been Vicar-General of Dublin and the restorer of the Irish College at Rome. This cathedral was enlarged and beautified by Bishop Henry O'Neill, who succeeded Bishop Thomas MacGivern in 1901.\nUnder Dr. McGivern's predecessor, Dr. John Pius Leahy, O.P. (1860\u20131890), a Dominican priory was founded on the Armagh side of Newry, and a church erected. The Poor Clares, who went to Newry from Harold's Cross, Dublin, in 1830, were for many years the only nuns north of the River Boyne. The Sisters of Mercy founded a convent at Newry in 1855.\nAbbey Yard in Newry marks the site of the Cistercian abbey founded in 1144 by St. Bernard's friend, St. Malachy O'Morgair, and endowed in 1157 by Maurice O'Loughlin, High King of Ireland. It is called in the annals Monasterium de Viridi Ligno \u2014 a name given to Newry from the yew-tree, said to have been planted there by St. Patrick, the Irish name being Niubar (and sometimes Newrkintragh, \"the yew at the head of the strand\") which is Latinized Ivorium or Nevoracum, but more commonly as above Viride Lignum.\n\n\n== Allegations of Sexual Abuse ==\nIn 2012 the Parish Priest of Donaghmore in the diocese, Fr Terence Rafferty, was convicted of four counts of indecently assaulting a young girl in 2001.  Five other offences were left on the books.  The offences had been reported to the diocese in 2011: the diocese suspended him and promptly informed the relevant authorities.On 1 March 2018 Bishop John McAreavey resigned as Bishop of Dromore with immediate effect amid controversy concerning his knowledge of, and behaviour towards Fr. Malachy Finegan. McAreavey celebrated Mass him alongside in 2000 despite knowing Finegan to be a paedophile against whom very serious criminal allegations had been made.   Indeed, in 2002, John McAreavey celebrated the funeral Mass of Malachy Finegan in Warrenpoint, Co. Down, Northern Ireland.\nThe Vatican's formal acceptance of McAreavey's resignation was announced on 26 March 2018 and Bishop Philip Boyce was appointed Apostolic Administrator.On Monday 15 April 2019, Pope Francis appointed the Archbishop of Armagh - Eamon Martin as Apostolic Administrator of the diocese with \"immediate effect\". In response to the appointment, the outgoing apostolic administrator Bishop Boyce said \"I am very happy to welcome Archbishop Eamon Martin as the new Apostolic Administrator of Dromore.  I wish to thank the people and clergy for their prayers, goodwill, encouragement and unstinting support over the last year.  While I am looking forward to my retirement, I remain available to pastorally support Archbishop Martin, and Dromore, in any way that I can\".\nArchbishop Eamon Martin said, \u201cThe Holy Father has asked me to take over the role of Apostolic Administrator from Bishop Boyce whilst continuing with my role as Archbishop of Armagh.  I am humbled by Pope Francis\u2019 request and grateful for his confidence in me.  It will be an honour for me to serve the people, priests and religious of Dromore during this transitional time for the diocese.  Please pray for me as I take up this new responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n== Ordinaries ==\n\nThe following is a basic list of the bishops since the beginning of the 19th century.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nHerbermann, Charles, ed.

    "Vyacheslav Volgin": "Vyacheslav Petrovich Volgin (Russian: \u0412\u044f\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u0433\u0438\u043d, 14 June 1879 \u2013 3 July 1962) was a Soviet and Russian historian who wrote a number of books on early forms or precursors of communism, and who became vice-president of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Early years ==\nVyacheslav Petrovich Volgin was born in Borshchyovka village, Khomutovsky District, Kursk Governorate, Russia on 14 June 1879. Between 1897 and 1908 he attended Moscow University, where he studied first physics and mathematics, then history and philology. A committed communist, he was repeatedly arrested during this period. He published his first scientific paper in 1906, on the German labor movement. In 1908 he wrote a study on A Revolutionary Communist of the 18th Century (Jean Meslier and his Testament). The study was published in 1919. During World War I, Volgin was a contributor to Maxim Gorky's Chronicles. Before the Revolution Volgin was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party since 1901 and became a Menshevik in 1914. He joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1920.\n\n\n== Post-revolution ==\nIn 1918 Volgin helped organize the Socialist Academy in Moscow, which later became the Communist Academy. He was a professor of the history of socialism at Moscow State University (MGU) from 1921 to 1930, and rector of the university from 1921 to 1925. One of the first challenges that he faced as rector was to reform the VUZy (\u0412\u0423\u0417 \u2013 \u0432\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0435\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435, \"higher educational institutions\") to ensure that their teachers and staff were ideologically sound. It took a huge effort to ensure that the correct people were elected. In August 1922 there was a purge of intellectuals. One of Volgin's predecessors as rector of MGU, Mikhail Mikhailovich Novikov, was placed under house arrest. Despite protests by Volgin, a few days later the State Political Directorate (GPU) told Novikov they were deporting him. Volgin did what he could to minimize the impact of the purge, trying to ensure that where the charges were minor the teachers could continue to teach.Volgin became president of the council of the sector of scientific workers of Rabpros (Russian: \u0420\u0430\u0431\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441) (Trade Union of Education Workers (Russian: \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043e\u044e\u0437 \u0420\u0410\u0411\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0421\u0432\u0435\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f)), the official educational workers' union. From 1919 to 1929 he was a member of the National Scientific Council, and from 1921 to 1922 Deputy Chairman of the Main Committee of Vocational Education of the RSFSR People's Commissariat. He was an organizer of the Russian Association of Research Institutes of Social Sciences (RANION), Institute of History of the Communist Academy and the Society of Marxist Historians. Volgin was permanent secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) from 1930 to 1935, and Vice-President of the RAS from 1942\u20131953.Volgin was Chairman of the Group for the Study of French history at the Institute of History of the Academy of Sciences. As Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences, he had authority over how books from abroad would be distributed to libraries and institutions of the Academy of Sciences. Volgin did what he could to ensure that the academy followed the communist party line and concentrated on \"useful\" work. Volgin edited a number of scientific periodicals and historical anthologies. He launched and edited the multi-volume series The precursors of scientific socialism in 1947. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1961. He died in Moscow on 3 July 1962, aged 83. His name was given to the V.P. Volgin Fundamental Library of the Social Sciences of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Academic contributions ==\nVolgin spent many years researching the history of social thinking in France before the French Revolution, developing an original view of the nature of the ideological struggle during this period. One of the subjects he studied was the teaching of the philosopher Charles Fourier, publishing two articles that analyzed Fourier's views. In 1924 he published a major work Sen-Simon i Sen-Simonizm on Saint-Simon and the resulting Saint-Simonianism movement.Volgin was the most active of Soviet academics in the study of classic utopias. He published and wrote the prefaces to editions of Tommaso Campanella (1934), Thomas More (1935) and Robert Owen (1950). In his introduction to the 1934 Russian-language version of Campanella's work The City of the Sun, Volgin identified the monastic life as an early form of \"communist utopia\", emphasizing \"the absence of private property, the universal obligation of labor (which is considered a matter of honor), the social organization of production and distribution, and the training through labor of the inhabitants.\"\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nSelected works:\n\nVolgin, V.

    "Walter de Gray": "Walter de Gray (died 1 May 1255) was an English prelate and statesman who was Archbishop of York from 1215 to 1255. He was Lord Chancellor under King John.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGray was the son of John de Gray, of Eaton in Norfolk and nephew of John de Gray, Bishop of Norwich. His birth year is not recorded, nor is his age when he died, but according to the historian Lee Wyatt, Gray was likely born around 1180. This assumes that in 1214 he was at least 30, the earliest legal age for consecration as a bishop, which would mean he was not born after 1184. Likewise, it is unlikely he was much older than 80 when he died, which gives an earliest possible birth year of 1175. He studied at Oxford University where he was tutored by Edmund of Abingdon.\n\n\n== Royal service under John ==\nGray was a favourite of King John of England, who appointed him Lord Chancellor in 1205, having paid John 5,000 marks for the office. He was named Bishop of Lichfield in 1210, but was never consecrated as bishop there. Gray was then elected Bishop of Worcester on 20 January 1214, after resigning as Chancellor in October 1214. His consecration as Bishop of Worcester took place on 5 October 1214. Gray was present at the signing of Magna Carta in June 1215. While he was away from England on a royal mission, he was appointed Archbishop of York, being elected on 10 November 1215 through the influence of John and Innocent III. John had wanted Walter, but the canons of York felt that Walter was ill-educated, and elected Simon Langton, brother of Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury. John objected, and wrote to Innocent III complaining of the election of the brother of one of his staunchest enemies, with which Innocent agreed. However, Gray eventually paid more than \u00a310,000 to the Pope in various fees to get his election confirmed. Walter attended the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215.\n\n\n== Royal service under Henry III ==\nGray was an important royal official during the minority of Henry III, who often posted him as a diplomatic envoy. Henry also named Gray as guardian of England when the King went to France in 1242. In 1252, Walter hosted King Henry and King Alexander III of Scotland for the Christmas feasts at York, which event cost the archbishop \u00a32,500.\n\n\n== As archbishop ==\nGray attempted to assert his archiepiscopal authority over Scotland, which not only resisted by the Scots but by the Archbishops of Canterbury. Gray had little success in defending his rights to Scotland against either adversary. Gray built the south transept of York Minster and purchased the village of Bishopthorpe, which became the residence of the Archbishop of York. He also endowed the church at Ripon.Gray held a series of councils in his diocese from 1241 to 1255 which endeavoured to enforce clerical celibacy, keep benefices from being inherited, and improve the education and morals of the clergy. He gave generously to his cathedral and other churches, as well as working to endow vicarages. He visited many of the monasteries of his diocese and helped those that were in financial difficulties. He also oversaw the translation of Wilfrid's remains to a new shrine at Ripon.\n\n\n== Death and legacy ==\nIn 1255 he visited London to attend a meeting of parliament, and died at Fulham on 1 May 1255. He was buried on 15 May 1255 at York Minster.Three nephews of Gray would also be clerics: William Langton (or Rotherfield) was Dean of York before being elected Archbishop of York but never consecrated, and Walter le Breton and Walter de Gray, who were canons of York.\n\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Thetis class": "The Thetis-class ocean patrol vessels or ocean patrol frigates, also called Stanflex 3000, is a class of large patrol vessels built for the Royal Danish Navy. The class comprises four ships, all built and commissioned in the early 1990s. The ships' tasks are mainly maintenance of sovereignty, search and rescue, fishery inspection and support to local (mainly Greenlandic) authorities. The operation areas are normally Greenland and the Faroe Islands, but the vessels also operate near Iceland on transit between Greenland and the Faroe Islands, and near Denmark.\n\n\n== Design ==\nThe ships each have double-skinned ice-reinforced hulls so that the ships can break through 80 centimetres (31 in) of solid ice. Thetis has undergone a conversion, first to participate in the CANUMAS-project, and later to become the fleet's flagship, a role that ended in September 2007. Thetis is fitted with Terma C-Flex Combat Management System. The Danish Navy has retrofitted the vessels with 12.7-millimetre (0.50 in) heavy machine guns, Stinger launchers and decoy launching systems. The ships can carry and use multiple StanFlex mission modules.\nIn the most common role (ocean patrol), the standard base crew is 47 persons and 16 conscripts, but in either command ship role or more warfare heavy roles, the base crew is expanded to 60 persons plus 4 aircrew for the Westland Lynx Mk.90B and one or two doctors.

    "Iroquois-class destroyer": "Iroquois-class destroyers, also known as Tribal class or DDG 280 class, were a class of four helicopter-carrying, guided missile destroyers of the Royal Canadian Navy. The ships were named to honour the First Nations of Canada.\nThe Iroquois class are notable as the first all-gas turbine powered ships of this class. Launched in the 1970s, they were originally fitted out for anti-submarine warfare, using two CH-124 Sea King helicopters and other weapons. A major upgrade programme in the 1990s overhauled them for area-wide anti-aircraft warfare with the Standard SM-2MR Block IIIA missile.\nDue to their extended service lives, the Iroquois-class destroyers were used in a variety of operational roles. They served as flagships for NATO's maritime force, deployed as part of United Nations and NATO forces in the Adriatic, Arabian and Caribbean seas and Atlantic and Indian oceans. The destroyers also performed coastal security patrols and search and rescue missions nearer to Canada.\nOne was sunk in a live-fire exercise in 2007, two more were decommissioned in 2015 and the last in 2017.\n\n\n== Background ==\nWith the disbandment of Banshee fighter aircraft squadrons and the retirement of the Second World War-vintage destroyers in the early 1960s, the Royal Canadian Navy no longer had air cover nor fire support capabilities. The Royal Canadian Navy sought to fulfill both these capabilities with the General Purpose Frigate (GPF) design. However, due to rising costs and an ambitious Defence Minister, Paul Hellyer, who had his own ideas as to where the Royal Canadian Navy should spend its money, the GPF program was cancelled on 24 October 1963.After the cancellation of the GPF program, the Royal Canadian Navy continued to design a vessel able to fulfill the lost capabilities. Several designs were drawn up, one of which was an improved version of the GPF with a better missile system, anti-submarine warfare (ASW) rocket and large calibre gun. In September 1964, Hellyer ordered an ASW design. The Royal Canadian Navy submitted a design that matched what Hellyer required that used steam turbines instead of gas and had a planned cost of $35 million, similar to the most recent ships constructed based on the  St. Laurent class.On 22 December 1964, Hellyer announced the planned construction of four new helicopter-carrying destroyer escorts as part of a larger package of procurement for the navy. Though the Royal Canadian Navy had submitted an ASW design, it took a further four years to settle on a final one. This was due in large part to the need for the accommodation of large helicopters, variable depth sonar and the requirement to spread the industrial benefits around the country. In the end the design improved over the GPF in several ways. Instead of the twin semi-automatic 5-inch (127 mm) gun mount, the new design had a single fully automatic 5-inch gun. The GPF was intended to be armed with the RIM-24 Tartar missile system. The new design ended up with the RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile system which was capable of taking on both missiles and aircraft. Personnel for the new class was to come from the discarded aircraft carrier Bonaventure which had been taken out of service after the government reduced forced levels. In December 1967, four new helicopter-carrying destroyers were announced as part of the five-year equipment program.In 1968, contracts were awarded to Davie Shipbuilding at Lauzon, Quebec and Marine Industries at Sorel, Quebec. However, the final drawings were not finished when all four ships were laid down in 1969. The entire program ended up costing $252 million. In 1970, the program was almost cancelled despite the fact that the ships were in production. This was due to the poor management of the program costs by the departments that governed the project. This eventually led to a significant reshuffling of senior positions at National Defence Headquarters. Commissioned in 1972\u201373, the ships perpetuated the names of Second World War-era Tribal-class destroyers, which led to the new class being referred to as the Tribal class.With the arrival of the Iroquois-class destroyers, a special service centre was created ashore with the same computer system, which was far more advanced at the time compared to anything else in the navy.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Iroquois class were ordered in 1968 as a revised design of the GPF. Designed with enclosed citadel, bridge and machinery spaces, the sources disagree about the general description of the Iroquois class. Gardiner and Chumbley state that as designed the ships had a displacement of 3,551 long tons (3,608 t) and 4,700 long tons (4,800 t) fully loaded. The destroyers were 423 feet (129 m) long overall and 398 feet (121 m) long at the waterline with a beam of 50 feet (15 m) and a draught of 14 feet 6 inches (4.42 m). They had a complement of 258 and 30 aircrew attached to the ship's company.Macpherson and Barrie claim that the class displaced 4,500 long tons (4,600 t), was 426 feet (130 m) long overall with a beam of 50 feet (15 m) and a draught of 15 feet (4.6 m). They state the vessels had a maximum speed of 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph) and had a complement of 244.The Iroquois class used a two shaft COGOG system that was powered by two Pratt & Whitney FT4A2 gas turbines creating 50,000 shaft horsepower (37,000 kW) and two Pratt & Whitney FT12AH3 cruising gas turbines creating 7,400 shp (5,500 kW). This gave the destroyers a maximum speed of 29 knots (54 km/h; 33 mph) and a range of 4,500 nautical miles (8,300 km; 5,200 mi) at 20 knots (37 km/h; 23 mph).The Iroquois -class was also designed with the ability to carry two CH-124 Sea King helicopters to be used primarily for ASW. These two helicopters enhanced their ASW capability and the Iroquois class were considered excellent ASW ships due to it. The Iroquois class had a landing platform with a double hauldown and Beartrap hauldown device. The platform is large enough for Mil Mi-14 helicopter, as it was proved during exercises in 1999 in the Baltic Sea.\n\n\n=== Armament ===\nThe Iroquois class was originally equipped with one OTO Melara 5-inch (127 mm)/54 calibre gun that was capable of firing 40 rounds per minute.For anti-air defense the ship was armed with one Mk III RIM-7 Sea Sparrow missile system. The Iroquois class had two Sea Sparrow launchers installed, each with four missiles which allowed the ship to launch eight missiles at a time for point defense. The ships carried a total of 32 missiles. The launchers were located at the forward end of the superstructure and retracted into the deckhouse. The missile system was guided by the Hollandse Signaal Mk 22 Weapon Control System. The system was criticised for the time it took to deploy from the housing, which took several minutes in order to warm-up the guidance system, as well as the reload time, which could be up to almost ten minutes. Another reason for criticism was that the fire control system was Dutch, and the mix of the Dutch fire control and the US missile system rarely worked as intended. The missiles were also ineffective against sea-skimming anti-ship missiles, such as the Exocet.The Iroquois class was also equipped with one Mk 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortar for ASW purposes along with two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes in trainable mounts. The Mk 32 tubes were used to fire Mark 46 torpedoes.\n\n\n=== Systems and sensors ===\nThe class was equipped with the Hollandse Signaal Mk 22 Weapon Control System for its missiles, and a tactical air navigation system (TACAN). The CCS 280 by Litton, which was a compressed version of the Automatic Data Link Plotting System (ADLIPS) electronic tactical system, was also installed aboard the class. Iroquois-class destroyers were equipped with an LW-03 long range warning radar antenna and SPS-501 long range warning radar. They were also equipped with SPQ-2D low level air search, surface search and navigation and M22 fire control radars. The destroyers had SQS-501 bottom target classification sonar and a hull-mounted SQS-505 sonar inside a 14 feet (4.3 m) dome. The also had the 18-foot (5.5 m) SQS-505 towed variable depth sonar.\n\n\n== TRUMP refit ==\n\nIn the 1980s, with the planned arrival of the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project, the Canadian Forces intended to convert the Iroquois class from purely ASW ships to anti-air warfare (AAW) vessels as a core element of the modernisation of the fleet. Named the Tribal Refit and Update Modernisation Program (TRUMP), the design contract was awarded to Litton Systems Canada Ltd. and required a total reconstruction of the superstructure, new propulsion, weaponry and electronics. In addition to their conversion to AAW vessels, the Canadian Forces sought to improve their command, control and communications capabilities in order to make them task group leaders.The shipyard contracts were handed out to Quebec shipyards by the Cabinet as a way to placate the Quebec caucus following the decision to award the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project to a New Brunswick shipyard. The total cost of the program was $1.5 billion.During the Gulf War, before Athabaskan had been able to undergo her TRUMP refit, she was given a Mk 15 Phalanx close-in weapons system (CIWS) on her quarterdeck as part of the upgrades given to ships deploying to the Persian Gulf.\n\n\n=== Alterations to initial design ===\nThe displacement of the ships increased to 5,100 long tons (5,200 t) at deep load after all the changes. The propulsion was overhauled also, with two GM Allison 570KF cruising turbines being installed in place of the Pratt & Whitney models which created 12,800 shaft horsepower (9,500 kW). The funnels were reconstructed replacing the twin outward-angled funnels with one large square funnel. This required the two uptakes being brought together and encased in a forced-air cooling system. This was done to reduce the infrared signature.As part of the TRUMP refit, the entire armament was overhauled. The OTO Melara 5-inch gun was removed and replaced by a 29-cell Mk 41 vertical launch system (VLS) for the SM-2 Block 2 surface-to-air missile. The Mk 41 VLS system was placed in the reconstructed forecastle deck. In 'B' position an OTO Melara 76 mm (3 in) Super Rapid gun was installed in the space vacated by the removal of the Sea Sparrow launchers. A Mk 15 Phalanx CIWS was placed abaft the remodelled funnel. The ships also received new radar and sonar, with new shield decoy launchers, the SLQ-504 Canadian Electronic Warfare System (CANEWS) and ULQ-6 electronic countermeasures.\n\n\n== Ships in class ==\n\n\n== Service history ==\n\nAll of the Iroquois class was laid down in 1969, Iroquois on 15 January, Huron and Athabaskan on 1 June and Algonquin on 1 September. Their names were chosen both to honour the First Nations of Canada, but also to perpetuate the names of destroyers that served during the Second World War. Iroquois was the first to commission, on 29 July 1972, followed by Athabaskan on 30 September, Huron on 16 December and Algonquin on 3 November 1973.By the early 1980s, the Iroquois-class were the only surface vessels in the Canadian navy that were capable of fighting a modern war. The destroyers underwent the TRUMP modifications beginning in 1987, with Algonquin being taken in hand on 26 October to 11 October 1991; Iroquois, 1 November 1989 to 3 July 1992; Athabaskan, from October 1991 to 3 August 1994; and Huron, from July 1993 and 25 November 1994.From the onset of their careers, the Iroquois-class ships were deployed to NATO naval missions such as STANAVFORLANT, performing search and rescue missions, such as Algonquin rescuing the crew from the fishing vessel Paul & Maria in 1974 or Athabaskan in 1981 when she sailed to rescue the crew of MV Euro Princess. They also participated in many major naval exercises.Iroquois, Huron and Algonquin were all flagships of STANAVFORLANT in 1978\u201379. In 1986, Algonquin captured the renegade fishing vessel Peonia 7 which had made off with personnel from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Peonia 7 had been caught illegally fishing in Canada's exclusive economic zone and had been boarded by Fisheries personnel for inspection. In 1987, Huron became the first member of the class to transfer to the west coast of Canada. In 1988, while attempting to assist the Belgian frigate Westhinder which had already grounded, Athabaskan herself went aground in Vestfjord, Norway.On 24 August 1990, Athabaskan, after a refit to add several advanced weapons including a close-in weapon system (CIWS), sailed to the Arabian Sea as flagship of the naval component of Operation Friction, the Canadian contribution to the Gulf War. The task group served in the central Persian Gulf, with other coalition naval forces, through the fall of 1990. After Operation Desert Storm began in January 1991, the task group undertook escort duties for hospital ships and other vulnerable naval vessels of the coalition. When the  Ticonderoga-class cruiser USS Princeton detonated two Iraqi bottom-moored influence mines (MANTAs) at the north end of the Persian Gulf and was seriously damaged, her commanding officer specifically requested the assistance of Athabaskan. Athabaskan could simultaneously operate two CH-124 Sea King helicopters, originally for anti-submarine warfare, which proved useful in searching out mines for long periods until a U.S. Navy minesweeper arrived. Athabaskan returned to her task group and remained on station in the Persian Gulf until after the war ended. After the hostilities were complete she was relieved by her sister ship Huron.In 1993 Algonquin was flagship of the force sent to the Adriatic Sea to enforce the blockade on Yugoslavia. Iroquois deployed in September 1993 to the Adriatic to take part in the blockade, returning in April 1994. In August 1994, Algonquin transferred to the west coast.In September 1999, Huron, carrying Canadian immigration officials, intercepted a ship trafficking 146 Chinese migrants. Royal Canadian Mounted Police boarded the vessel from Huron while the destroyer escorting the vessel into Nootka Sound. On 3 August 2000, Athabaskan sent her helicopter to board GTS Katie, a cargo vessel carrying Canadian military equipment whose charterer refused to deliver them.On 17 October 2001, as part of Operation Apollo, Iroquois led the Canadian Task Group to the Arabian Sea. Eventually, Algonquin and Athabaskan also took part in the War in Afghanistan. In 2003, while readying for deployment to Operation Apollo, Iroquois's Sea King crashed on deck and the ship was forced to return to Halifax.In September 2005, Athabaskan was among the Canadian ships sent to Louisiana to aid in the recovery efforts following the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. In 2008 Iroquois was among the Canadian warships deployed to the waters off Somalia as part of CTF 150, the multi-national task force that concerned itself with drug and people smuggling and piracy in the region.In 2010, after Haiti was hit by a major earthquake followed by at least twelve significant aftershocks, Canada sent Athabaskan and the frigate Halifax to Haiti as part of Operation Hestia. Athabaskan was sent to Leogane. In 2011, Athabaskan and Algonquin deployed to the Caribbean Sea as part of Operation Caribbe, a counter-narcotics smuggling operation. Iroquois deployed in 2012, with Athabaskan returning in 2014 and 2015.\n\n\n=== Retirement ===\n\nDespite Huron being the most recently refitted Iroquois-class destroyer, she was placed in mothballed status in 2000, due to a personnel shortage following defence cutbacks during the late 1990s. Huron was paid off in 2005, and sunk in a live-fire exercise in 2007 by her sister ship Algonquin.In August 2013, Algonquin was involved in a collision with the auxiliary vessel HMCS Protecteur during a naval exercise. Algonquin suffered significant damage along her port side hangar. The vessel was laid up following the collision. In May 2014, while visiting Boston, Massachusetts, severe cracks were discovered in the hull of Iroquois requiring her immediate return to Canada and lay up for inspection. The inspection determined the hull was compromised and would require the ship to be laid up indefinitely. On 19 September 2014, the Royal Canadian Navy announced that these two ships were to be paid off along with the  Protecteur class, leaving only Athabaskan active.On 27 November 2015, Algonquin, along with Protecteur, was sold to be broken up for scrap to R.J. MacIsaac Ltd. of Antigonish, Nova Scotia. They were towed to Liverpool, Nova Scotia where the work will be done. On 10 March 2017 Athabaskan, the last active ship in the class, was decommissioned.\n\n\n== Replacement ==\nIn 2008 the Single Class Surface Combatant Project which was included in the National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy was announced as the replacement for the Iroquois class. The new vessels will eventually replace the Halifax class, as well as the capabilities previously provided by the Iroquois class, beginning in about the mid-2020s. In October 2018, a group led by BAE Systems along with its partners Lockheed Martin Canada, CAE Inc., L3 Technologies, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates and Ultra Electronics, were selected as the preferred design. On 8 February 2019, Canada signed an agreement with Lockheed Martin Canada, BAE Systems, Inc. and Irving Shipbuilding to design and construct the $60 billion Canadian Surface Combatant project.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nBarrie, Ron; Macpherson, Ken (1996).

    "Krejci Dump": "The Krejci Dump was a privately owned dump occupying 47 acres (19 ha) on several sites along Hines Hill Road near Boston Heights, Summit County, Ohio. After the area was converted into part of the then-Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area (now the Cuyahoga Valley National Park), the National Park Service discovered that the property, part of one of the most-heavily used parks in the country, was also one of the most contaminated sites in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Region V. The dump subsequently became a Superfund cleanup site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Krejci family owned a parcel exceeding 234 acres (95 ha) and opened a junkyard for burning trash and dumping scrap metal in 1940.  At some point, the dump began accepting industrial and municipal waste, much of it toxic. This activity continued until 1980, when it closed, but the salvage business operated until 1985. The property was bisected by the 1972 construction of Interstate 271, which left 42 acres (17 ha) on the north side, and 192 acres (78 ha) on the south side.The Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area was created in 1974, and the National Park Service acquired the Krejci property in 1985, thinking they had an old junkyard. The Krejcis vacated the property, and the following year, a person collecting bottles on the site became ill. Park rangers would complain of headaches, rashes, and odors. The National Park Service requested a thorough analysis of the site's contents from the Environmental Protection Agency. It was closed to the public in 1986 after toxic chemicals were found at 14 separate locations on 19 acres (7.7 ha) north of I-271 and 28 acres (11 ha) south.\n\n\n== Toxins ==\n\nUpon investigation and testing of the site between 1986 and 1987, many toxic substances were found at the site, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), arsenic, dioxin, heavy metals, and other carcinogens. Thousands of leaking drums were found on the property.  These drums contained waste from industrial processes, including paint, ink, herbicides, pesticides, solvents, and industrial sludge.\n\n\n== Companies responsible ==\nFord Motor Co, General Motors, Federal Metal Co, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M), Chrysler, Kewanee Industries (a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation USA), and Waste Management of Ohio were found to be potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in contributing and transporting toxic waste to the Krejci dump. The PRPs had manufacturing facilities in the general vicinity of the Krejci site; Waste Management of Ohio, who had acquired all of the smaller, local refuse hauling companies, had been held ultimately responsible for transporting the wastes. All of these companies were sued in 1997 by the US government through CERCLA (Superfund) to recoup the cost of the cleanup, and all of the PRPs agreed to settle out of court with the exception of 3M, who went to trial and lost.\n\n\n== Cost ==\nThe cost of the entire project to the US government is $50 million. However, money recovered through the CERCLA lawsuits resulted in a $21 million judgment against the PRPs. The cleanup project, at a cost of $29 million, was paid for by Ford Motor Co. with help from General Motors. The lawsuits, combined with Ford and GM covering the cost of the cleanup accounted for the entire cost of the project. In 2001 a National Park Service attorney said that the cleanup was the most expensive in the National Parks system.\n\n\n== Cleanup ==\nCleanup of the site consisted of removal of the drums themselves, along with the rest of the dump's non-hazardous contents. At one point in the cleanup, thousands of multicolored flags covered the former dump's property, identifying multi-increment sub-sample locations. Since soil had been contaminated by chemicals leaking from drums, dirt had to be removed from depths ranging from 12 inches (30 cm) to 25 feet (7.6 m). In the first 12 months of cleanup alone, 108,000 cubic feet (3,100 m3) of contaminated soil had been trucked out of the site. Most of the non-hazardous soil went to two licensed landfills in Ohio, and the contaminated soil went to a licensed facility outside of Detroit.  By August 2012, 371,000 short tons (337,000 t) of contaminated material had been removed from the site.\n\n\n== Outcome ==\n\nBecause of the extensive contamination, and its on-going identification as the cleanup proceeded, the NPS has made numerous predictions about the end-date for cleanup and remediation of the areas. For example, in July 2011 it was predicted that the Krejci dump site would be in the final stages of revegetation in the spring of 2012. But it wasn't until August 2012 that the NPS declared \"comprehensive post-excavation soil sampling effort establishes that remediation goals for the 46-acre former dump site have been met,\" and, \"The final steps necessary to restore the Site may now begin, including final grading; re-vegetation using native meadow grasses, forbs and shrubs; and restoration of 3 acres of wetland and wet meadow habitats.\" The Ohio Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) also had a projected end-date of sometime in 2012.The ultimate goal of the NPS was to have the site appear as it originally would have, with native plants and wetlands covering the area. \"Upon completion of the cleanup, the site will be restored to natural conditions consistent with surrounding Park habitat, and restrictions on public access will be removed.\"The most recent update from the NPS is dated February 3, 2015: \n\nThe remediation of the Krejci Dump Site has benefitted the Park and the public. This has become a model remediation in the NPS; by taking a contaminated former industrial site, restoring the ecology to its native condition (including three acres of wetland and wet meadow habitats) for unrestricted use by Park visitors, animals and plants alike, and transforming the additional open space that can be used for recreation [n]ear a very urban environment. The responsible parties continue to control erosion and invasive plants until the re-vegetation performance standards are met.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPhotos of Krejci Dump, then and now\nKrejci Dump Fact Sheet, National Park Service, 2005 Fhuds\nBoston Heights Dump Site Still Contaminated\nSummit County Toxic-Waste Dump In Park Needs More Cleanup Work\nCERCLA (Superfund) website\nKrejci Dump Site Cleanup and Restoration (National Park Service, 2012)",
    "Tim Solliday": "Tim Solliday is a contemporary California Plein-Air Painter and Western Artist who is known for his San Gabriel Valley landscapes and his paintings of American Indians and other western subjects.   He studied with the California Impressionist portrait and landscape painter Theodore Lukits (1897\u20131992) in the 1970s and began working professionally in the early 1980s.  Solliday is described as a painter with a \"muscular, masculine style\" and has been compared to artists of the Taos Ten, especially E. Martin Hennings.   He is a Signature Member of the California Art Club (f. 1909).  He exhibits with the Laguna Plein-Air Painters Association, the Oil Painters of America  and at the Maynard Dixon Invitational, which is held in Utah each year.   Solliday's work has been featured in a number of American art magazines such as Southwest Art,  American Artist and Art of the West.  Through his plein-air work in the pastel medium and large canvasses, he has played an important role in the revival of landscape painting in Southern California.\n\n\n== Youth and artistic training ==\nSolliday was born in the small town of Ottumwa, Iowa, but grew up on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in southern California. His father was an artist and an illustrator, so he developed an interest in art as a young boy.  After he completed his education,  Solliday went to work in the billboard industry as an apprentice.  While he was interested in becoming a fine artist, working in outdoor advertising proved to be good experience for an aspiring painter and it enabled him to pay for his art studies.  It was while working in this commercial field that he learned about the Lukits Academy, where the Early California painter Theodore Lukits still gave students classical instruction. Solliday began his studies there in 1975. This course of study is now commonly known as the Atelier Method.  Solliday studied with Lukits for five years.  He began by \"drawing from the antique\" which meant doing charcoal or graphite portraits of marbles and plaster casts of ancient Roman and Greek statuary.  These studies taught the students to understand \"values\" which are the tonal gradations of light and shadow. Solliday moved from working from plaster casts to simple still life set-ups only after his instructor was satisfied with his work. Eventually he began to work in color, painting still life set-ups under the colored lights that Lukits used to simulate conditions an artist would find out of doors. He also attended Lukits' anatomy and life drawing classes.\n\n\n== Beginning plein-air painting ==\nDuring the summers Solliday also began to paint \u201cen plein-air\u201d, directly from the landscape. He began going out painting with Arny Karl (1940\u20132000), an older Lukits student who had been painting out of doors for a number of years. Using the pastel medium, he, Karl and Peter Seitz Adams went on plein-air trips to the local foothills, the Southland beaches, including trips to the ocean and the San Gabriel Mountains. Solliday, Adams and Karl painted en plein-air with pastels, as their teacher Lukits had done in the 1920s and 1930s.  Solliday concluded his studies in 1980, but the thorough grounding in the old French atelier method that he received from Lukits is what he felt made his career as a figurative painter possible.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\nIn the early 1980s Solliday left the outdoor advertising industry to paint full-time.  He began exhibiting his works in Beverly Hills and Carmel, California.  The early works that he sold were western paintings of cowboys and American Indians which were heavily influenced by American illustrators of the early 20th century.  By the mid-1980s  he branched out into scenes of horses and horse racing that were done from sketches made at the Santa Anita racetrack.  By the 1980s and early 1990s Solliday began concentrating on plein-air landscapes instead of western subjects.  In 1994, Solliday and the illustrator Bill Stout became two of the first artists to join the organization. During this phase of his career, he exhibited his work in Pasadena  and  Los Angeles.  By 2003, Art and Antiques Magazine described Solliday as \"one of the top contemporary plein-air artists.\" According to a recent article by the western art writer Bonnie Ganglehoff, Solliday's work has taken a new direction in recent years, because he has been working with his friend Steve Huston, a figurative painter.  In the pages of Southwest Art, she wrote that working with Huston gave his work a new dynamism.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSolliday has exhibited regularly with the California Art Club, at The Pasadena Museum of California Art, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and in the Maynard Dixon Country Invitational. He has also exhibited at the Luckman Fine Arts Center, California State University, Los Angeles.  He is currently represented by Maxwell Alexander Gallery in Los Angeles, CA and Trailside Galleries in Jackson, WY and Scottsdale, AZ.\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n1st Prize, 86th Annual California Art Club Gold Medal Exhibition, July 8\u201316, 1995\n1st Prize, 1993 Landscape, Oil Painters of America Annual Exhibition\nArts for the Parks Finalist, 1993\nArts for the Parks Finalist, 1991\n\n\n== See also ==\nAtelier Method\nCalifornia Art Club\nCalifornia Plein-Air Painting\nEn plein air\nCowboy in art and culture\nLandscape art\nPeter Seitz Adams\nArny Karl\nBillboard\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Magazine references ==\nMorseburg, Jeffrey, Tim Solliday, A Biographical Sketch, Art of California\nGanglehoff, Bonnie, Catching Up With Tim Solliday, Southwest Art Magazine, July 2008\nWestern Art Collector, July 2008\nEditors, 'Artist Worth Watching,' Art-Talk, November 2004\nOtserman, Julie, Coast to Coast,' Southwest Art, August 2004\nGangelhoff, Bonnie, 'Wild at Heart,' Southwest Art, February 2004\nHerrin, Alice,  'Art Events- Texas,' Southwest Art, September 2003\nMoure, Nancy Dustin Wall, 'Coming of Age,' Art & Antiques, June 2003\nEditors, 'On the Scene,' Southwest Art, May 2003\nEditors, 'On the Scene,' Southwest Art, March 2003\nStavig, Vikki, 'The Moods of God's Spirit,' Art of the West, January 2003\nStavig, Vikki'For the Love of the Land,' Art of the West, July 2002\nStavig, Vikki, 'Revitalization of the California Art Club,' Art of the West, May 2002\n'Art Events,' Southwest Art, February 2001\nBrown, Joan, 'Light Motif: California Impressionism,' Wildlife Art, December 2000\nStavig, Vikki, 'Tradition Lives On/California Art Club,' Art of the West, June 2000\nBurlingham, Michael J., 'Man with a Muse,' American Artist, July 1999\nBucher, Kristen, 'Best of the West: Texas,' Southwest Art, April 1997\nMcGarry, Susan Hallsten, 'Variety and Harmony,' Southwest Art, February 1997\nRunbeck, Katheryn, 'Tim Solliday,' Southwest Art, February 1997\n\n\n== Catalogs ==\nCalifornia Art Club: 99th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2010 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 98th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2009 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 97th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2008 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 96th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2007 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 95th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2006 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 94th Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2005 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 93rd Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2004 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 92nd Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2003 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 92nd Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition, 2002 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\nCalifornia Art Club: 91st Annual Gold Medal Juried Exhibition,  2001 (CAC Exhibition Catalog), Artist Entry and illustration\n\n\n== External links ==\nCalifornia Art Club Web Site",

    "Decisions in combat sports": "In combat sports, a decision is a result of the fight or bout that does not end in a knockout, submission or other finish, in which the (usually) three judges' scorecards are consulted to determine the winner; a majority of judges must agree on a result. The judges' result can either award a win, loss, or draw. \nIf no judges are in attendance for scoring and the fight reaches the time limit with no finish, the fight goes to no decision.\n\n\n== Scoring ==\nIf a fight reaches the time limit with no finish, the outcome of fight is decided based on the judges' scorecards. In most professional boxing and mixed martial arts fights, there are three judges.\nIn a \"ten-point system\", a judge must award the fighter whom they judged as having \"won the round\" ten points, while the other fighter receives nine points or less. If a judge feels that there was no clear winner in a round, they must award both fighters ten points. This does not include point deductions from referees; rounds where neither fighter scores ten points can occur. \nAt the end of the bout, each judge will tally the scores to determine which fighter had won, if any, according to the judge's tally; a fighter that \"won\" a majority of rounds usually emerges with more points. If a fighter ends up with a higher number of points, that fighter \"won\" on that judge's scorecard. A fighter has to \"win\" on at least two scorecards to win the fight. If neither fighter \"won\" on at least two scorecards, the match is a draw; in championship fights, the champion usually retains the title in a draw, if not, it is \"vacated\" - the title belongs to no fighter and is vacant. The scores do not necessarily have to be identical in unanimous decisions.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nIn the table below, the bout is fought by fighters from the blue and red corners and no knockouts occurred.\n\n\n== Other decisions ==\nKnockout (KO): It occurs when a fighter falls to the ground legally due to strikes, and does not answer the referee's count. A referee can immediately call a knockout without counting if they have determined strikes have rendered a fighter unconscious, and/or otherwise unable to respond to the count.\nA technical knockout (TKO) occurs when the referee stops a fight because they have determined one of the fighters can no longer meaningfully defend themselves, or has sustained damage that renders them unable to meaningfully defend themselves.\nTechnical decision: It happens when a fight has to be stopped because of a headbutt. If the fight has exceeded a certain number of rounds, the judges' scorecards can be used to determine a winner, as above.\nTechnical draw: It occurs when the judges' can not determine a winner when the fight goes to the scorecards due to a headbutt.\nNo contest: It is used to describe a fight that ends for external reasons, which does not result in a win, a loss or a draw.\nReferee technical decision: It happens when, during any rest period between rounds, a boxer refuses to continue or their corner pulls them out, thereby forcing the referee to call an end to the fight.\nDisqualification: It happens when a bout is stopped short of knockout or judges' decision because, intentionally, one or both contestants have repeatedly flagrantly fouled an opponent or violated other rules. The disqualified boxer automatically loses the bout to the opponent.\nIn double disqualifications the result is usually declared a no contest regardless of round.\nSubmission: It happens when a fighter gives in to the opponent. The fighter who gives in loses the fight.\nA technical submission is ruled when the referee or doctor stops the fight because a fighter is unable to continue in combat. This usually happens if a submission move renders a fighter unconscious before they can submit, or if they suffer an injury due to a submission move.",

    "Frits Veerman": "Frits Veerman (8 November 1944 \u2013 23 February 2021) was a Dutch technician and whistleblower. In the 1970s, Veerman uncovered a large nuclear espionage at Urenco, a producer of enriched uranium in Almelo, the Netherlands.\nVeerman noted that his Pakistani colleague at FDO (where Veerman was working as a photographer) - a subsidiary research lab of VMF-Stork contracted to URENCO for building ultracentrifuges - Abdul Qadeer Khan was spying when he was requesting more and more information. At his home he saw all kinds of sensitive information. Khan passed on the sensitive information to Pakistan, allowing the country to develop an atomic bomb. Veerman warned against espionage, but it was not listened to. After his report, Veerman lost his job and his career was over. Veerman wanted reparation from the Dutch government and Stork B.V.

    "USS Wanderlust (SP-923)": "USS Wanderlust (SP-923) was a patrol vessel that served in the United States Navy from 1917 to 1919.\nWanderlust began life as the wooden-hulled screw launch Faalua, designed by F. D. Lawley and built by George Lawley & Son of Neponset, Massachusetts, for George G. Peters of Boston, Massachusetts. Completed in 1907, Faalua was subsequently owned in turn by Sherburn M. Becker and E. J. Steiner, both of New York City. Apparently Steiner purchased her in 1913 and renamed her Wanderlust.\nWanderlust was delivered to the U.S. Navy on 26 August 1917 for World War I service. Armed and designated SP-923, she was commissioned at the Charleston Navy Yard at Charleston, South Carolina, on 12 September 1917, Lieutenant, junior grade, J. P. Smith, USNRF, in command.\nWanderlust operated on section patrol duties in the 6th Naval District well into 1918, although she appears to have spent much time, initially, undergoing repairs for her temperamental engines. Her ports of call included Parris Island, Port Royal, South Carolina, and Charleston, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and Jacksonville, Florida. When on patrol duty, Wanderlust stopped and boarded fishing vessels, ascertaining whether or not they carried proper navigational equipment and licenses that were in order. Wanderlust conducted night harbor patrols at Brunswick, Georgia, from April 1918 into the late autumn of 1918.\n\nWanderlust's deck logs cease on 30 September 1918 when she was at Brunswick. The 1918 edition of Ship's Data: U.S. Naval Vessels lists her as serving on section patrol duties as of 1 November 1918. In the absence of solid data, it must be assumed that, like many other district patrol craft, if she was in active service in mid-to-late November 1918, she would have ceased defensive patrolling on 24 November 1918, 13 days after the armistice ended World War I. She may have lain in reserve or performed dispatch services between 30 September 1918, when her deck logs end, and 2 February 1919, the date upon which she was struck from the Navy List.\nReturning to private ownership, Wanderlust retained her name into the 1920s under a succession of owners, including Irving E. Raymond of Stamford, Connecticut, and Mrs. Marguerite Park of New York City, before she was acquired in 1927 by William Sternfeld of New York City, who renamed her Diana. She disappeared from  the Lloyd's List of American Yachts between 1929 and 1931, presumably leaving service sometime during that period.\n\n\n== References ==\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.

    "H-3 Air Base": "H-3 Air Base (code-named 202C, 202D) is part of a cluster of former Iraqi Air Force bases in the Al-Anbar Governorate of Iraq.  H3 is located in a remote stretch of Iraq's western desert, about 435 kilometers from Baghdad in western Iraq. It is close to the Syrian\u2013Iraqi border, and near the highway that connects Jordan with Baghdad.\nH-3 Main is supported by two dispersal airfields, H-3 Southwest 32\u00b044\u203248\u2033N 039\u00b035\u203259\u2033E, and H-3 Northwest 33\u00b004\u203234\u2033N 039\u00b035\u203252\u2033E, and a Highway strip, 42 kilometers to the west 32\u00b050\u203255\u2033N 039\u00b018\u203228\u2033E. H-3 Southwest is served by a single 9,700-foot runway and has a parallel taxiway that could be used as an alternate runway.\nThe complex was one of eight major operating bases of the Iraqi Air Force prior to the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq by Coalition forces.\n\n\n== History ==\nH-3 airstrip was established by the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1935 as a landing ground for pumping station H3 on the Mosul\u2013Haifa oil pipeline.It was never a British Royal Air Force (RAF) air base although during World War II the pumping station and adjacent oil pipeline were patrolled by RAF Armoured Cars, together with RAF Iraq Levies based at H3 and RAF aircraft would have used the airstrip.\n\n\n=== Iraqi Air Force ===\nDuring the 1970s, it was one of several Iraqi airfields upgraded under project \"Super-Base\" in response to the experiences from Arab-Israeli wars in 1967 and 1973.\nCompanies from Yugoslavia \u2013 previously engaged in building bridges in Iraq \u2013 became involved in airfield construction. Due to their specific construction of these airfields \u2013 which included taxi-ways leading right out of Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS) and laid diagonally to the runways \u2013 they became known as \"Trapezoids\" or \"Yugos\".\nThe protection of each HAS consisted of one meter thick concrete shells, reinforced by 30 cm thick steel plates. There was only one entrance and this was covered by sliding doors, made of 50 cm thick steel armoured plate and concrete. The HAS' were usually built in small groups \u2013 seldom more than five, with each group sharing the same water and power supply, besides having own backup gasoline-powered electrical generator, and each HAS being equipped with a semi-automatic aircraft-refueling system.\n\n\n=== Iran\u2013Iraq War ===\n\nDuring the winter of 1980\u20131981, Iraqi Air Force kept back its military airplanes in H-3 base to protect them from Iranian Air Force Attacks. So the Iranian Air Force devised an operation to bomb the air base. On 4 April 1981, eight IRIAF F-4 Phantoms flew their boldest interdiction strike of the war, penetrating over 1,000 km into Iraq in order to attack all three airfields of the H-3 complex.Achieving complete surprise, the Iranians made several passes against Al-Walid, H-3 Northwest and H-3 Southwest ABs, destroying three AN-12s, one Tu-16, four MiG-21s, five Su-20/-22s, eight Mig-23s, and two Mirage F-1EQs (delivered only weeks earlier), as well as damaging eleven others beyond repair, including two Tu-16 bombers. Two Iraqi pilots and fourteen personnel were killed, together with three Egyptian and an East German officer, while 19 Iraqis, four Egyptians, and two Jordanians were badly injured. This strike considerably degraded Iraq's capability to retaliate.\n\n\n=== Operation Desert Storm and the 1990s ===\nH-3 and H-2 became priority targets for coalition aircraft during the Gulf War. The airfield was targeted by different types of aircraft, from F-117 stealth fighters to US Navy A-6 intruders. Chemical weapons were stored at the H-3 airfield (main) during Operation Desert Storm in 1991 according to declassified U.S. intelligence reports which describe Iraqi efforts to disperse chemical weapons by truck to other locations. The S-shaped bunker located at H-3 airfield (main) and the four at the H-3 ammunition storage facility were damaged or destroyed during Desert Storm. Of the 22 S-shaped bunkers located across Iraq, 10 had been destroyed as of 8 February 1991. It is not known whether the rest were subsequently destroyed.\nIn response to Iraqi hostile acts against coalition aircraft monitoring the Southern No-Fly Zone, Operation Southern Watch coalition aircraft used precision-guided weapons to strike an air defense command and control facility at a military airfield 240 miles west and slightly south of Baghdad, at approximately 2:30 a.m. EDT on 5 September 2002. Aircraft dropped precision-guided bombs on the H3 airfield. The strikes were carried out by nine American F-15 Strike Eagles and three RAF Tornado GR4 ground attack aircraft flying from Kuwait. The attack on the air defence command and control facility was the first time that a target in western Iraq had been attacked during the patrols of the southern no-fly zone. According to press reports, about 100 US and British aircraft took part in the attack, making it the biggest single operation over the country in four years.\n\n\n=== 2003 Iraq War ===\n\n\n==== Seizure ====\nOn 18 March 2003, B and D Squadrons of the British 22nd SAS Regiment infiltrated Iraq along with 1 Squadron Australian SASR and headed for H-2 and H-3 Air Base. They set up observation posts and called in airstrikes that defeated the minimal Iraqi resistance around H-2. The combined British and Australian squadrons then drove straight onto H-2 virtually unopposed. H-3 airbase was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. The British and Australian SAS were joined by members of Delta Force and on 24 March by Green Beret ODAs from Bravo company, 1st Battalion 5th SFG. Together they called in a constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3, forcing the Iraqi defenders to flee. The Coalition SOF secured H-3 and seized around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns and an enormous amount of ammunition. A company of Rangers and Royal Marines from 45 Commando flew from Jordan to reinforce the air bases, the Coalition SOF handed the bases over to their control and proceeded with their other missions.\n\n\n=== Current status ===\nCurrent aerial imagery shows that the operational structures around the airfield and its three auxiliary airfields appear to be largely intact. The taxiways at the airfields remain exposed to the elements. The use of runways is interdicted by a series of obstacles, including unusable airframes.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nWarwick, Nigel W. M. (2014).

    "Battle of the Buliok Complex": "The Battle of the Buliok Complex took place on 11 February 2003 in an area within the provinces of Maguindanao and Cotabato in Mindanao, Philippines. The 60-hectare complex, which stretches from Pikit, Cotabato to Pagalungan, Maguindanao, was a stronghold of the Muslim separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Accused by the Philippine government of harboring members of Pentagon, a notorious kidnap-for-ransom gang operating in Mindanao, the MILF was attacked in the Buliok complex by the Armed Forces of the Philippines under orders from then-President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. \n\n\n== Background ==\n\nAfter losing their camps, foremost of which was Camp Abubakar, due to the \"all-out-war\" policy of then-President Joseph Estrada in 2000, the MILF withdrew into the areas around the Liguasan Marsh. The Buliok Complex (called the Buliok Islamic Center or the Buliok Mosque by the MILF) encompasses areas where the boundaries of Maguindanao, Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat meet. It was within this complex that the MILF re-established their presence.\n\n\n== The battle ==\nThe Philippine government commenced military operations against the MILF on the day Eid al-Adha was being celebrated, tactically reasoning that the MILF forces would be vulnerable to attack. The government at first would not state the reason for the attack on the complex; later it would admit that the main objective was the MILF itself, in order for the government to maintain the dominant position in the conflict. Jesus Dureza, chairman of the government panel during peace talks with the MILF during this time, is on record stating that the attack on the Buliok complex came after the government failed to forge a ceasefire agreement with the MILF.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Buliok complex was captured by government forces on 13 February 2003. A month after, the MILF attempted to retake their lost stronghold in an offensive that resulted in the deaths of 68-200 of their members. During this period, the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the MILF exchanged widely-conflicting casualty reports. Government military officials commented on how \"youthful-looking\" the slain MILF fighters were; Mohagher Iqbal, then-spokesman of the MILF central committee, admitted that some of their fighters were \"able-bodied teenagers\" who voluntarily joined the MILF.Salamat Hashim, the founder of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, died by year's end.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2000 Philippine campaign against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front\nBangsamoro peace process\n\n\n== References ==",

    "The Country of the Pointed Firs": "The Country of the Pointed Firs is an 1896 book by American writer Sarah Orne Jewett. It is considered by some literary critics to be her finest work.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nThe narrator, a Bostonian, returns after a brief visit a few summers prior, to the small coastal town of Dunnet, Maine, in order to finish writing her book. Upon arriving she settles in with Almira Todd, a widow in her sixties and the local apothecary and herbalist. The narrator occasionally assists Mrs. Todd with her frequent callers, but this distracts her from her writing and she seeks a room of her own.\nRenting an empty schoolhouse with a broad view of Dunnet Landing, the narrator can apparently concentrate on her writing, although Jewett does not use the schoolhouse to show the narrator at work but rather in meditation and receiving company.  The schoolhouse is one of many locations in the novel which Jewett elevates to mythic significance and for the narrator the location is a center of writerly consciousness from which she makes journeys out and to which others make journeys in, aware of the force of the narrator's presence, out of curiosity, and out of respect for Almira Todd.\nAfter a funeral, Captain Littlepage, an 80-year-old retired sailor, comes to the schoolhouse to visit the narrator because he knows Mrs. Todd. He tells a story about his time on the sea and she is noticeably bored so he begins to leave. She sees that she has offended him with her display of boredom, so she covers her tracks by asking him to tell her more of his story. The Captain's story, of his sea-travels and the strange journey he once had which he believes points to the existence of a geographic link between this world and the next in the Arctic Circle, cannot compare to the stories that Mrs. Todd, Mrs. Todd's brother and mother, and residents of Dunnet tell of their lives in Dunnet.\nThe narrator's friendship with Mrs. Todd strengthens over the course of the summer, and the narrator's appreciation of the Maine coastal town increases each day.  Soon, Mrs. Todd brings the narrator out to Green Island, in order to meet her elderly mother, Mrs. Brackett, who is well-respected by all in town and the surrounding farms.  Attending to her on the island is William, Mrs. Todd's brother, a solitary and shy older man who helps his mother tend the garden and catches fish for them in the surrounding waters.  Although initially reluctant to meet new people, and clearly intimidated by his sister's large personality, William comes to appreciate the narrator and shows her all around Green Island.  By the end of the visit, the narrator feels deeply welcomed by the Bracketts.\nIn July, Mrs. Todd anxiously prepares for a visit of unknown length from her old friend, Mrs. Fosdick, and the narrator worries that Mrs. Fosdick's arrival and stay in the house will disrupt the daily regularity she's become accustomed to, and alienate her from Mrs. Todd.  But it turns out that all three women get along quite well, and spend evenings talking of friends and acquaintances in town, present and past.  One of these tales centers on \"poor Joanna,\" a girl they grew up with who, when left by her beau for another woman who lived further up the bay, retreats in sadness and penance to Shell-heap Island, a small deserted spot owned by her deceased father.  Joanna ends up living the rest of her life on the island, fixing up the small cottage her father had built there, keeping chickens, tending a small garden, and harvesting clams on the shore.  The Dunnet community doesn't know what to make of this, with some writing her off and others distressed and trying to convince her to come back to town.  Eventually her way of life is accepted, as if she were an anchorite living in hermitage, and some of the townspeople pass by the island and throw things like warm clothes, tools, and extra foodstuffs up onto the shore, but without disturbing her.  Later in the book, the narrator impulsively asks Captain Bowden, who is escorting her in his boat near Shell-heap, to steer closer so she can go ashore.  The narrator finds that only the stone foundation of the cottage still exists, yet there is a worn path through the field, which leads to Joanna's gravestone.\nAfter Mrs. Fosdick has left, the narrator accompanies Mrs. Todd and Mrs. Blackett on a day-long trip to the Bowden family reunion, a grand event in the lives of people in Dunnet and the surrounding countryside, as most of them are related to the large Bowden clan by blood or marriage.  The trip and reunion are the high point of the narrator's summer, and where she is fully accepted by the general community.  After this, there are moments when the narrator begins to display a keen insight into the residents, especially when she befriends Elijah Tilley, an old fisherman lonely and widowed, who she had previously found taciturn and forbidding.  Invited to his house one afternoon, she learns about his dearly loved dead wife, and as Elijah shows her around the house, the narrator feels she understands the story of their lives together and the depth of the dead woman's decency and character.\nAt the end of the summer, the narrator must depart, fearing she will find Boston a harsh, bitter place after her sojourn in Dunnet.  Mrs. Todd is too moved to say a proper goodbye to her, and after saying a solitary, tender farewell to the schoolhouse and the town itself, the narrator boards the steamboat which will take her away.  From its stern she looks back at Dunnet until the entire town disappears from view.\n\n\n== Publication and response ==\nThe Country of the Pointed Firs was serialized in the January, March, July, and September 1896 issues of The Atlantic Monthly. Sarah Orne Jewett subsequently expanded and revised the text and added titles for the chapters. The novel was then published in book form in Boston and New York by Houghton, Mifflin and Company in November 1896.Henry James described it as her \"beautiful little quantum of achievement.\" Ursula K. Le Guin praises its \"quietly powerful rhythms.\" Because it is loosely structured, many critics view the book not as a novel, but a series of sketches; however, its structure is unified through both setting and theme. The novel can be read as a study of the effects of isolation and hardship experienced by the inhabitants of the decaying fishing villages along the Maine coast.Jewett, who wrote the book when she was 47, was largely responsible for popularizing the regionalism genre with her sketches of the fictional Maine fishing village of Dunnet Landing. Like Jewett, the narrator is a woman, a writer, unattached, genteel in demeanor, intermittently feisty and zealously protective of her time to write. The narrator removes herself from her landlady's company and writes in an empty schoolhouse, but she also continues to spend a great deal of time with Mrs. Todd, befriending her hostess and her hostess's family and friends.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Country of the Pointed Firs at Standard Ebooks\n\n The Country of the Pointed Firs at Project Gutenberg\n The Country of the Pointed Firs public domain audiobook at LibriVox",

    "Jamaica 6d abolition of slavery postage stamp": "The Jamaica 6d abolition of slavery postage stamp was prepared for issue in June 1921 but cancelled shortly before issue due to political unrest and the controversial subject matter.\nBy some estimates 416,000 stamps were printed and sent to the island in the form of three shipments. The first two consignments got to Jamaica around the same time and were incinerated at the General Penitentiary in Kingston on July 2, 1921. The final consignment arriving in October was similarly destroyed. The Crown Agents were then instructed to destroy the 7220 stamps held in their possession along with about 740 stamps distributed via the Universal Postal Union. Two blocks of four were preserved; one block being given to King George V while the other became part of the official collection held at the General Post Office in Kingston. This block mysteriously disappeared from the Post Office's vaults and reappeared sometime later as four singles.As the stamp was so close to issuance, specimens were sent to the Universal Postal Union as usual, a number of which survive.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPostage stamps and postal history of Jamaica\n\n\n== References ==",
    "Monster Hunt": "Monster Hunter (\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc, Monsut\u0101 Hant\u0101) is a Japanese media franchise centered around a series of fantasy-themed action role-playing video games that started with the game Monster Hunter for PlayStation 2, released in 2004. Titles have been released across a variety of platforms, including personal computers, home consoles, portable consoles, and mobile devices. The series is developed and published by Capcom.\nThe games are primarily action role-playing games. The player takes the role of a Hunter, slaying or trapping large monsters across various landscapes as part of quests given to them by locals, with some quests involving the gathering of a certain item or items, which may put the Hunter at risk of facing various monsters. As part of its core gameplay loop, players use loot gained from slaying monsters, gathering resources, and quest rewards to craft improved weapons, armor, and other items that allow them to face more powerful monsters. All main series titles feature multiplayer (usually up to four players cooperatively), but can also be played single player.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the game series has sold 75 million units worldwide, and is Capcom's second best-selling series following Resident Evil. The early games in the series principally sold well in Japan and other Asian countries, popularized by the series' use of ad hoc multiplayer features on portable consoles. Monster Hunter has been critically well-received in Western markets, but had generally languished in sales, in part due to the game's steep learning curve. However, with  Monster Hunter: World (2018), Capcom aimed to attract a global audience using the power of advanced home gaming consoles and computers and released the title simultaneously worldwide. World became the best-selling Monster Hunter game within three days of its release, and became Capcom's single best-selling video game of all time with 20 million sales as of October 2021, including more than 70% outside of Japan.\nIn addition to games, the franchise has an anime based on the spinoff game Monster Hunter Diary: Poka Poka Airou Village, Monster Hunter Stories: Ride On based on the spinoff title Monster Hunter Stories, a manga Monster Hunter Orage, and a book Monster Hunter Episode. A feature film directed by Paul W. S. Anderson was released on December 3, 2020.\nAn animated film, subtitled Legends of the Guild, was released on August 12, 2021 on Netflix.\n\n\n== Gameplay ==\nMonster Hunter games are action role-playing games that takes place in a shared low fantasy setting, where the human-like species have a pre-industrial level of technology such as steam power, but continue to study the ruins of a long-past advanced civilization. In the setting's less populated regions, monsters roam the landscape and threaten small villages or research bases that have been established to study the ruins and these monsters. Players take the role of a Hunter that serves to help protect the villages and bases from these monsters, typically aiding in researching these. This is generally presented through a series of quests to slay or trap a monster but can include numerous optional challenges.\nThe core feature of Monster Hunter is its compulsion loop. Unlike traditional computer role-playing games, a player's Hunter does not grow and has no intrinsic statistics or attributes whatsoever. Rather, the Hunter's abilities are instead defined by the specific weapons and armor selected. The player can equip weapons, armor, and items most beneficial towards completing a given mission, and if successful, the Hunter is awarded in both in-game money (\"zenny\") and loot representing parts from the monster. These parts, along with other resources collected while on missions or through mission rewards, can be used to forge or upgrade new weapons and armor which then can be used in against more powerful monsters and tackle more difficult missions, completing the compulsion loop. Harder missions are typically restricted by a hunter's rank, which cumulatively increases as the player completes specific missions designated by the quest giver. Mission rewards are often generated randomly, often requiring the player to grind the same monster repeatedly to get the right parts. Weapons and armor have intrinsic bonuses or penalties towards certain types of elemental or physical damages, and may provide special skills which can be fine-tuned through the mix-and-matching of equipment pieces.The games feature a variety of different weapon classes, ranging from swords, hammers, and bows, with the most recent titles (Generations, World, and Rise) having a total of fourteen classes. Each weapon class has a unique set of combat maneuvers and reflect a number of different play styles based on speed of attack, damage strength, range and the application of buffs and debuffs to monsters and allies. Monster Hunter games use an \"animation priority\" combat, committing the player to a move until the animation is completed and leaving them potentially vulnerable to a monster's attack. Further, players are encouraged to watch their Hunter's health and stamina. Losing all health will force a retreat to a base camp, and after three such retreats, the mission is deemed a failure. Performing most combat actions consumes stamina, which recovers in a short amount of time; once exhausted of stamina, the Hunter becomes vulnerable as they pause to catch their breath. Monsters and other environmental hazards can also inflict blights and other negative status effects that impair combat abilities. Combat is centered around watching for a monster's tells prior to an attack to be able to dodge it and/or make a counterattack, and looking for openings to unleash strings of attack combos, depending on the Hunter's current weapon. Unlike most other action games, Monster Hunter fights have been compared to a series of boss fights.Nearly all Monster Hunter games have a single-player mode; in these, the Hunter is often accompanied by a Felyne or Palico, a sentient cat-like creature that provides support and limited offensive abilities in combat. Most Monster Hunter games released with support for four-player cooperative online modes, allowing the group to hunt down stronger versions of monsters, though this support has since been disabled in older games. The games typically have a main quest line, frequently called \"Low Rank\" or \"Village Quests\", which can take up to fifty hours to complete. Once completed, the game opens up with new \"High Rank\" or \"Gathering Hall\" quests, featuring stronger versions of monsters they have previously faced, as well as new monsters are yet seen and unique variants of these foes, all of which provide better components for more powerful weapons and armor sets, providing hundreds of hours of potential gameplay following the main quest. Most, if not all titles have a third rank of difficulty (\"G Rank\" or \"Master Rank\"), released after the base game. These add more monsters, locations, weapons and armour sets to the game.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first Monster Hunter game was one of three titles Capcom had developed to take advantage of the processing power and online capabilities of the PlayStation 2, which according to Ryozo Tsujimoto, who has been the series' producer since Monster Hunter Freedom 2, had begun to match arcade games in capabilities; the other two such titles were Auto Modellista and Resident Evil Outbreak. Tsujimoto considered Monster Hunter to be the culmination of the work of these other two titles once it was released. He also felt that the game was intended for such cooperative play so that players of any skill level, working with others, could feel accomplished in taking down giant creatures. Monster Hunter proved a success, selling over 1 million copies, principally in Japan. Enhanced versions of the early games, adding more difficult monsters and end-game quests, were released with a \"G\" affixed to the end (such as Monster Hunter G for the first such game); for those titles that were released in Western regions, these were often, though not always, affixed with the Ultimate moniker. A second team worked to develop a series for the PlayStation Portable. These games often had a more lighthearted tone and expanded upon the palicoe system. In Japan, these games were released under the \"Portable\" title, while in the west they were released under the \"Freedom\" title. Even after these naming conventions were abandoned, this established the general tradition of one team releasing games for home consoles and a separate team releasing a portable game a few years later.The series took off explosively in Japan with Monster Hunter G and Monster Hunter Portable/Freedom on the PlayStation Portable and even more so once its sequels Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Portable 2nd/Freedom 2 and Monster Hunter Portable 2nd G/Freedom Unite were released which supported up to four players. Handheld systems are generally more popular in Japan and due to the country's high population density, it was easy to find players to hunt cooperatively with, making it a phenomenon there. James Miekle, writing for PC Gamer, had worked for Q Entertainment and lived in Japan during the release of Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, which was the best selling PlayStation Portable game of all time and described how even during work, impromptu Monster Hunter sessions would break out between employees and there was extensive marketing of Monster Hunter branded consumer goods.While Monster Hunter had been successful in Japan, its popularity in Western markets (primarily North America and Europe) languished. In contrast to the Japanese culture, Western markets favored home consoles and computers during the mid-2000s and because of a thinner population density, most players relied on Internet-based gaming rather than local ad hoc networking. The series also struggled with a difficult learning curve that had made the games off-putting in Western markets.The series had little popularity in the West until the release of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Nintendo 3DS, a console that had gained a sizable foothold in Western markets. While Monster Hunter's popularity in the West was still to a niche group, Capcom saw the potential for more growth there and took steps to better localize the next few titles to make the series more attractive; Monster Hunter 4 was the first game in the series to break one million sales in Western markets. Capcom recognized there was still room for further growth of the series there; in an October 2016 interview, Capcom chairman Kenzo Tsujimoto said they were looking towards increasing the popularity of the games in the Western markets, recognizing that gaming consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One have dominance in these regions over handhelds. Monster Hunter: World, the series's first major entry targeting home consoles and computers, was developed to be more alluring for Western markets without trying to make the game simpler. A number of changes in gameplay were made that took advantage of the consoles' new technology; notably, while the prior games had split each hunting area into different zones as necessitated by limits of the console hardware, World's used seamless zones and several changes to gameplay were made to account for this. World became the series' best selling game, achieving more than 17 million units sold by 2021 and making the Monster Hunter series Capcom's best-selling series following Resident Evil.With the success of the changes to the formula defined by World, Capcom decided to continue this approach with the series' next major title, Monster Hunter Rise for the Nintendo Switch.\n\n\n== Games ==\nBelow is a list of games in the Monster Hunter main series. Each generation has a number of entries that are derivative of the original release. While the first four main titles were numbered, the subsequent installments, starting with World, use a keyword instead of a number to reflect a central concept for that game.\n\n\n=== Main series ===\n\n\n=== Spinoffs ===\n\n\n== Reception ==\nSince the series debuted, Monster Hunter has sold 78 million units across all titles by  f December 31, 2021; it is Capcom's second highest-selling series, following Resident Evil.Total worldwide sales for Monster Hunter games exceeding 1 million units, through December 31, 2021. are listed below:\nMonster Hunter World, including shipments of the standalone Iceborne version, surpassed 20 million units by October 2021.\n\n\n== Other media ==\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nA female Monster Hunter appeared as a playable character via downloadable content in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite. The game also features a stage called \"Valkanda\", which combines Val Habar from the fourth installment with Wakanda from the Marvel universe. Rathalos and Tigrex, two of the series' flagship monsters, make a cameo appearance in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker on hunting missions. Rathalos appeared as a special event monster to fight in Final Fantasy XIV as part of a cross-promotional event with Monster Hunter: World, with the Behemoth appearing in World in return. In 2018, Rathalos also appeared as a boss character and a summonable Assist Trophy in the crossover fighting game, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, while several Mii Fighter costumes based on Monster Hunter were added post-launch in March 2021 a few weeks ahead of Rise's release. In 2020, Rathalos made a limited appearance in Cygames' mobile title Dragalia Lost as part of an in-game event.The Monster Hunter games themselves have offered crossover events with other Capcom and third-party properties, allowing users during the event to earn armor and weapons inspired by the other property. For example, Monster Hunter World has had promotional events that include Resident Evil, Mega Man, Assassin's Creed, and The Witcher series.\n\n\n=== Anime ===\n\nA series of anime shorts titled MonHun Nikki Girigiri Air\u016b-mura Air\u016b Kiki Ippatsu (ja:\u30e2\u30f3\u30cf\u30f3\u65e5\u8a18 \u304e\u308a\u304e\u308a\u30a2\u30a4\u30eb\u30fc\u6751) was broadcast beginning August 10, 2010.

    "Fiat Pratola Serra modular engines": "The Fiat Pratola Serra modular engines (also known as family B engines for the 4 cylinder units, and family C engines for the 5 cylinder units) are a family of engines produced by the Fiat Group since 1994 and used in Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia and Jeep vehicles. They are named after the Pratola Serra municipality in which they're being produced.\n\n\n== Story ==\nThis new engine family debuted with the Lancia Kappa, and were designed to allow the production of different units, both diesel and petrol, in various displacements and configurations while decreasing development and production costs thanks to the modular architecture.\nFive cylinder launch versions:\n\nThese engines are produced in the FGA's FMA (Fabbrica Motori Automobilistici) factory in Pratola Serra. It's an advanced factory, with a production capacity of 600,000 engines/year and producing both petrol and Diesel engines.\nStarted in 1993, it was developed to produce multiple engines with a single production line, sharing components between them.\nIn 2010 the Chinese GAC Group started production of 1.8 and 2.0 Alfa Romeo Twin Spark 16V configurations of the Pratola Serra modular engine branded as \"VTML\" in China. These engines constitute however unique configurations, mating the single spark plug cylinder head from the 1.8 16V VFD to the 1747 and 1970 Twin Spark engine blocks, the latter with balance shafts, while retaining the power levels of the Twin Spark 16V. While these engines have been phased out in the European market in favor of the 1.4 MultiAir Turbo gasoline engine, part of the smaller Fiat FIRE series, they have later been updated with dual variable valve timing (branded \"DCVVT\") and turbochargers, and are as of 2016 used in Trumpchi automobiles.\n\n\n== Engine specifications ==\nEngine blocks are produced in four- and five-cylinder versions with similar specs, usually made from cast iron, with five main bearings for the four cylinder versions and six main bearings for the five cylinder versions. Exceptions are the later version of the petrol 1.7 L (1,742 cc) and the diesel 2.1 L (2,143 cc) four-cylinder blocks, made from aluminum. They are developed to withstand turbocharging. Some versions have counter-rotating balance shafts to reduce vibrations. The aluminium pistons have graphite skirts to reduce internal engine friction.\nCylinder heads are made in aluminum alloy. Petrol versions have an integrated coolant pump and pentroof combustion chambers with an angle of 47\u00b0 between valves. The turbodiesels have a different, flat combustion chamber design.\nThey usually have a DOHC valvetrain configuration with hydraulic tappets, driving four valves per cylinder. Exceptions are the 1.4 12V unit, also with hydraulic tappets but a SOHC valvetrain, driving three valves per cylinder, and the 1.9 8V and 2.4 10V turbodiesels, with a SOHC valvetrain with mechanical tappets, driving two valves per cylinder. The 1750 TBi gasoline and 16V Multijet diesel engines feature hydraulic tappets with roller rocker arms. Some versions feature variable valve timing (VVT). The camshafts are belt-driven.\nIn addition to VVT, some versions also feature variable-length intake manifold (VIS).\nEarlier Alfa Romeo versions use the Twin Spark ignition system. There is also a version of the four cylinder 2.0 L (1,970 cc) block using direct injection, used only in Alfa Romeo's vehicles, dubbed as JTS.\nIn Brazil, the 5 cylinder petrol engines equipped the Marea sedan and break (Marea Weekend) lines between 1998 and 2006, including a 2.0 20V with deactivated VVT (125 PS) for lower taxation, 2.0 20V VVT (140 PS), 2.4 20V with VVT and VIS (157 PS) and a Turbocharged 2.0 20V (180 PS) detuned from the 220 PS version from Fiat Coup\u00e9. A slightly updated version of the 2.4 20V was also used on the Stilo Abarth with 165 PS.\n\n\n== Engine blocks ==\n\n\n== Current production ==\n\n\n== Applications on Fiat vehicles ==\n\n\n== Applications on Lancia vehicles ==\n\n\n== Applications on Alfa Romeo vehicles ==\n\n\n== Applications on Jeep vehicles ==\n\n\n== Applications on other vehicles ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlfa Romeo Twin Cam engine\nAlfa Romeo Twin Spark engine\nFiat Twin Cam engine\nFully Integrated Robotised Engine\nJTD engine",
    "2016 Union Pacific oil train fire": "On June 3, 2016, a Union Pacific train with 96 tank cars carrying Bakken oil from New Town, North Dakota to U.S. Oil and Refining in Tacoma, Washington derailed in the Columbia River Gorge near Mosier, Oregon. 16 of the 96 cars derailed after the train's emergency brake system about 18 cars back from the engines engaged - several cars then caught fire. By 5pm large explosions were coming from the tankers. All of the tank cars were modern CPC-1232 design.Interstate 84 in Oregon was closed, with Washington State Route 14 being recommended as a detour.\nWashington Department of Ecology, US Coast Guard, Federal Railroad Administration, and Portland Airport's specialty airport fire tender carrying 1,300 U.S. gallons (4,900 L) of firefighting foam were among the 20 agencies that responded. As of 4:30pm firefighters were allowing the fire to burn the oil, simply monitoring it.\nMosier residents were evacuated and the sewage treatment plant was shut down. An oil sheen was seen on the Columbia River by the following morning. Two days after the crash residents were allowed to return to their homes, and freight trains were running on the tracks, to the strong objection of the community. The community then passed an emergency motion asking Union Pacific to remove all oil from the damaged cars before resuming use of the tracks. Union Pacific pushed the damaged cars out of the way and limited the train speed to 10 miles per hour (16 km/h) in the section.42,000 US gallons (160,000 l) of oil were spilled. Much of it was consumed by fire, some went into the Columbia River, and 10,000 US gallons (38,000 l) were recovered from the city's sewage treatment plant.\n\n\n== Non-Investigation Controversy ==\nThe National Transportation Safety Board declined to investigate due to the lack of injuries or fatalities and early information gathered after the incident occurred did not pose a significant safety issue.In response to the derailment and lack of investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, Oregon Senators Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden introduced the Mandate Oil Spill Inspections and Emergency Rules (Mosier) Act which calls for a moratorium on oil train traffic after major wrecks and require the Department of Transportation to reduce the amount of volatile gases in the crude oil those trains have been hauling. The bill would die in committee.\n\n\n== See also ==\n2015 Mount Carbon train derailment\n Media related to 2016 Union Pacific oil train fire at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Janice McClain": "Janice Michell McClain (born 25 January 1964 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American R&B singer, probably best known for her 1979 disco hit \"Smack Dab in the Middle\".\n\n\n== Early life and teenage career ==\nMcClain was raised in North Philly, the only child of a construction father and a mother who worked as a secretary and later as a dressmaker. Singing nearly from infancy in church, McClain grew up in a musical household - both of her parents had themselves cut records as teenagers - , McClain becoming conversant at an early age with current Soul hits, showtunes and opera: her early idols included Freda Payne and Diana Ross and as a teenager McClain became an especial fan of Michael Jackson. A student at the Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts, McClain also studied at Settlement Music School.\nAt age 14 McClain's evident vocal prowess led to her professional performing debut singing with the local jazz ensemble Pieces of a Dream: also when McClain was 14, her uncle Milton Tennant, a songwriter and record producer, had McClain cut her first record. Shortly after her fifteenth birthday McClain recorded the track \"Smack Dab in the Middle\", co-written and co-produced by Tennant and Thom Page (the latter also an uncle of McClain's): the track was successfully shopped to RFC, the recently launched Warner Bros. disco-oriented label, and released October 1979 to become one of the Top Ten most-played tracks in American discoth\u00e8ques for the first five weeks of 1980. However the track would not become a mainstream success - barely crossing over to the R&B chart with a #91 peak - and although McClain did cut tracks for a projected album  she had no evident further releases prior to two mid-1980s 12\" singles.\n\n\n== Adult career ==\nOn 10 July 1982 - a month after her high school graduation - McClain was in the lineup of a Robin Hood Dell benefit concert alongside such Philly soul stars as McFadden & Whitehead, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes & Billy Paul. Two days before her nineteenth birthday McClain reportedly caused a local sensation making her debut at the premiere North Philly jazz club Jewel's, with McClain rapidly becoming established as a top lounge act, regular gigs at Jewel's  leading to engagements at New Jersey venues. McClain also performed at the Kool Jazz Festival  \"jazz picnic\" at Waterloo Village in June 1983, and would serve as opening act for Philly engagements of such top R&B acts as James Brown and the Commodores, also opening for the O'Jays in Atlantic City.\nWhile performing at the Trump Plaza (Atlantic City) showroom Jezebel's late in 1984 McClain was scouted by Jheryl Busby, head a&r rep for the Soul music division of MCA Records: Busby had been tipped off re McClain by Patti Labelle after the latter had caught McClain's act either at Jezebel's or at Harrah's Marina where McClain had made her Atlantic City debut that September. Mcclain was signed to MCA in July 1985 with her self-titled album originally scheduled for a 30 April 1986 release with a March release for the balladic track \"Let's Spend the Night\" as advance single: however the album's release was delayed until the year's end with the dance track \"Passion & Pain\" as lead single, \"Let's Spend the Night\" being issued as the second single in April 1987: neither the album nor its singles were successful with only \"Passion and Pain\" charting, stalling at #75 on the R&B chart.Subsequent to a 1994 12\" single release, McClain's recording resume has comprised chorale duties for Philly-area sessions, contributing to the albums It's Long Overdue by Keith Martin (1994), All the Way From Philadelphia by the Three Tenors of Soul (William Hart, Ted Mills, Russell Thompkins Jr.) (2007), Love, Niecy Style by Deniece Williams (2007), and George Clinton & His Gangsters of Love (2008), plus the 2010 seasonal EP Ronnie Spector's Best Christmas Ever.

    "Chew Stoke": "Chew Stoke is a small village and civil parish in the affluent Chew Valley, in Somerset, England, about 8 miles (13 km) south of Bristol and 10 miles north of Wells. It is at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills, a region designated by the United Kingdom as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and is within the Bristol/Bath green belt. The parish includes the hamlet of Breach Hill, which is approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) southwest of Chew Stoke itself.\nChew Stoke has a long history, as shown by the number and range of its heritage-listed buildings. The village is at the northern end of Chew Valley Lake, which was created in the 1950s, close to a dam, pumping station, sailing club, and fishing lodge. A tributary of the River Chew, which rises in Strode, runs through the village.\nThe population of 991 is served by one shop, one working public house, a primary school and a bowling club. Together with Chew Magna, it forms the ward of Chew Valley North in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. Chew Valley School and its associated leisure centre are less than a mile (1.6 km) from Chew Stoke. The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural; many residents commute to nearby cities for employment.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nArchaeological excavations carried out between 1953 and 1955 by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield from the Ministry of Works found evidence of extensive human occupation of the area. Consecutive habitation, spanning thousands of years from the Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods (Old, Middle, and New Stone Age), to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind. Discoveries have included stone knives, flint blades, and the head of a mace, along with buildings and graves.\n\n\n=== Romano-Celtic temple ===\n\nChew Stoke is the site of a Romano-Celtic double-octagonal temple, possibly dedicated to the god Mercury. The temple, on Pagans Hill, was excavated by Philip Rahtz between 1949 and 1951. It consisted of an inner wall, which formed the sanctuary, surrounded by an outer wall forming an ambulatory, or covered walkway 56.5 feet (17.2 m) across. It was first built in the late 3rd century but was twice rebuilt, finally collapsing in the 5th century. The positioning of the temple on what is now known as Pagans Hill may seem apt, but there is no evidence for any link between the existence of the temple and the naming of the road.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nDuring the Middle Ages, farming was the most important activity in the area, and farming, both arable and dairy, continues today. There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples, pears, and plums. Evidence exists of lime kilns, used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches.In the Domesday Book of 1086, Chew Stoke was listed as Chiwestoche, and was recorded as belonging to Gilbert Fitz-Turold. He conspired with the Duke of Normandy against King William Rufus, and subsequently, all his lands were seized. The next recorded owner was Lord Beauchamp of Hache. He became \"lord of the manor\" when the earls of Gloucester, with hereditary rights to Chew Stoke, surrendered them to him. According to Stephen Robinson, the author of Somerset Place Names, the village was then known as Chew Millitus, suggesting that it may have had some military potential. The name \"Stoke\", from the old English stoc, meaning a stockade, may support that idea.The parish was part of the hundred of Chew.\n\n\n=== Bilbie family of bell and clockmakers ===\n\nThe Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers lived and worked in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They produced more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nIn the 20th century, Chew Stoke expanded slightly with the influx of residents from the Chew Valley Lake area. These new residents were moved to Chew Stoke when the lake was created in the 1950s. In World War II, 42 children and three teachers, who had been evacuated from Avenmore school in London, were accommodated in the village. On 10 July 1968, torrential rainfall, with 175 millimetres (7 in) falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke, double the area's average rainfall for the whole of July, led to widespread flooding in the Chew Valley, and water reached the first floor of many buildings. The damage in Chew Stoke was not as severe as in some of the surrounding villages, such as Pensford; however, fears that the Chew Valley Lake dam would be breached caused considerable anxiety.\n\nOn 4 February 2001, Princess Anne opened the Rural Housing Trust development at Salway Close. Each year, over a weekend in September (usually the first), a \"Harvest Home\" is held with horse and pet shows, bands, a funfair, and other entertainments. The Harvest Home was cancelled in 1997 as a mark of respect following the death of Princess Diana in the previous week. The Radford's factory site, where refrigeration equipment was formerly manufactured, was identified as a brownfield site suitable for residential development in the 2002 Draft Local Plan of Bath and North East Somerset. That plan has generated controversy about balancing land use to meet residential, social, and employment needs.During November 2012 a series of floods affected many parts of Britain. On 22 November a man died after his car was washed down a flooded brook in Chew Stoke and trapped against a small bridge.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nChew Stoke has its own nine-member parish council with responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.\nThe village is part of the ward of Chew Valley North in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, which has the wider responsibility for providing services such as education, refuse collection, and tourism. The ward is currently represented by Councillor Malcolm Hannay, a member of the Conservative Party. It is also part of the North East Somerset, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020.\nThe police service is provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary with two Community Support Officer and one police officer covering the wider Chew Valley area. The Avon Fire and Rescue Service have a fire station at Chew Magna.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe area of Chew Stoke is surrounded by arable land and dairy farms on the floor of the Chew Valley. It is located along the Strode Brook tributary of the River Chew, on the northwest side of the Chew Valley Lake. While much of the area has been cleared for farming, trees line the tributary and many of the roads. The village is built along the main thoroughfare, Bristol Road, which runs northeast to southwest. An older centre is located along Pilgrims Way, which loops onto Bristol Road and features an old stone packhorse bridge\u2014now pedestrianised\u2014and a 1950s Irish bridge, used as a ford in winter. The bridge is 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) wide and has 36 inches (910 mm) parapets. Houses line both of these roads, with residential cul-de-sacs and lanes extending from them.\nChew Stoke is approximately 8 miles (13 km) south of Bristol, 10 miles (16 km) north of Wells, 15 miles (24 km) west of Bath, 17 miles (27 km) east of Weston-super-Mare, and 9 miles (14 km) southwest of Keynsham. It is 1.3 miles (2.1 km) south of Chew Magna on the B3130 road that joins the A37 and A38. The A368 crosses the valley west of the lake. The \"Chew Valley Explorer\" bus route 672/674, running from Bristol Bus Station to Cheddar, provides public transport access. This service is operated by CT coaches and Eurotaxis and subsidised by Bath and North East Somerset council. In 2002, a 1.9-mile (3.1 km) cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened around the western part of the lake from Chew Stoke. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors, and cyclists of all abilities. Funding was provided by Bath and North East Somerset Council, with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. The minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists. Bristol Airport is approximately 10 miles (16 km) away, and the nearest train stations are Keynsham, Bath Spa, and Bristol Temple Meads.\n\n\n== Demography ==\nThe population of Chew Stoke, according to the census of 1801, was 517. This number increased slowly during the 19th century to a maximum of 819 but fell to around 600 by the end of the century. The population remained fairly stable until World War II. During the latter half of the 20th century, the population of the village rose to 905 people. Data for 1801\u20131971 is available at Britain Through Time;\ndata for 1971\u20132001 is available from BANES The 2001 Census gives detailed information about the Chew Valley North ward, which includes both Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. The ward had 2,307 residents, living in 911 households, with an average age of 42.3 years. Of those, 77% of residents described their health as 'good', 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no work qualifications, and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.3%. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, the ward was ranked at 26,243 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived and 32,482 the least deprived. A small number of light industrial/craft premises exist at \"Fairseat Workshops\", formerly the site of a dairy. However, they provide little employment, and many residents commute to jobs in nearby cities.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n\n=== St Andrews Church ===\n\nSt Andrews Church, a Grade II* listed building on the outskirts of Chew Stoke, was constructed in the 15th century and underwent extensive renovation in 1862. The inside of the church is decorated with 156 angels in wood and stone, and the church includes a tower with an unusual spirelet on the staircase turret. In the tower hang bells cast by the Bilbie family.\nThe reconstructed Moreton Cross in the churchyard was moved there when Chew Valley Lake flooded, and the base of the cross shaft, about 80 feet (24 m) southwest of the tower, is thought to date from the 14th century and is itself a Grade II* listed building, as is the Webb monument in the churchyard. The churchyard gate, at the southeast entrance, bears a lamp provided by public subscription to commemorate Queen Victoria's Jubilee of 1897 and is a Grade II listed structure.In the church are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local people who died in World War I and the six who were killed in World War II. There is also a stained glass window showing a saint with a sword standing on a snake, and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II. There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church, and just inside the porch, on the left of the church door, is a stone figure holding an anchor, which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake. There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family, then living at the court, by Queen Elizabeth I.\n\n\n=== Rectory ===\n\nThe Rectory, at the end of Church Lane, opposite the church hall, is believed to have been built in 1529 by Sir John Barry, rector 1524\u201346. It has since undergone substantial renovations, including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W.P. Wait and further alterations c.1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The clock tower has since been removed. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere, and Malet. It is Grade II* listed.\n\n\n=== New rectory ===\n\nThe Reverend John Ellershaw built the new rectory in the 1870s. The last rector to occupy it was Lionel St Clair Waldy from 1907 to 1945. It was then bought by Douglas Wills, who donated it and the rectory field to Winford Hospital as a convalescent home for 16 children. It was later used as a nurses' home before being sold for private use.\nIt is now split into several residential units.\n\n\n=== Grade II listed buildings ===\nAs with many cities and towns in the United Kingdom, the age of a number of the buildings in Chew Stoke, including the church, school, and several houses, reflects the long history of the village. For example, Chew Stoke School has approximately 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils either attend Chew Valley School or any of the independent schools in the area. These two buildings were built in 1858 on the site of a former charity school founded in 1718. The architect was S.B. Gabriel of Bristol. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were carried out in 1970.An obelisk on Breach Hill Lane, dating from the early-to-mid-19th century, is said to have been built as a waterworks marker. It has a square limestone plinth about 3 feet (1 m) high. The obelisk is about 32 feet (10 m) high with a pyramidal top and small opening at the top on two sides.\n\nThe importance of farming is reflected in the age of many of the farmhouses. Manor Farm, on Scot Lane (not to be confused with at least two other Manor Farms in the locality) is thought to date from 1495 and, as such, is probably the oldest building in the village. Presently (2007) occupied by Mr and Mrs Slater; the building has recently (2002) undergone a sympathetic extension to incorporate an old semi-derelict barn onto the main house for use as a garage and workshop. Mr Slater, a Chartered Engineer, is interested in bringing the art of clock making back to the village. Rookery Farmhouse, in Breach Hill Lane, is dated at 1720, with later 18th century additions to either side of the central rear wing.\nAn attached stable, 20 feet (6 m) northeast of the farmhouse, is also a Grade II listed building.\nSchool Farmhouse, in School Lane, dates from the late 17th century and has a studded oak door in the side of the house.\nWallis Farmhouse, farther along School Lane, is dated at 1782.\nYew Tree Farmhouse, one of the oldest buildings in the area, is a cruck built farmhouse of which there are very few in North Somerset. It was included in the dendrochronology project carried out by the Somerset Vernacular Building Research Group 1996\u20131998 and the crucks gave a felling date of 1386, the house has been extensively altered and added to over later centuries.\nNorth Hill Farmhouse also has 15th century origins.\nPaganshill Farmhouse dates from the 17th century.\nFairseat Farmhouse is from the 18th century and includes a plaque recording that John Wesley preached at the house on 10 September 1790. In August of that year, Fairseat Farmhouse was \"registered among the records of this County as a House set apart for the worship of God and religious exercise for Protestant Dissenters.\" At that time the house belonged to Anna Maria Griffon. In the garden is a large evergreen oak (Ilex) which measured 98 feet (30 m) across until half of it broke away in a gale in 1976.The Methodist Chapel was built in 1815/16 after religious services had been established at Fairseat Farm, and the chapel was rebuilt in the late 19th century with limestone walls with stone dressings and a slate hipped roof with brick eaves stacks and crestings.In the hamlet of Stoke Villice, which is south of the main village, there is a 19th-century milestone inscribed \"8 miles to Bristol\" that also has listed status.\n\n\n== Education ==\nChew Stoke Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School serves the village itself and surrounding villages in the Chew Valley. It is a Church of England voluntary controlled school linked with the St. Andrew's parish church. It has about 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old. After the age of 11, most pupils attend Chew Valley School.The school was founded as a charity in 1718 making it one of the oldest schools in Somerset. Its original buildings were demolished in 1858 and replaced with new ones to designs by S.B. Gabriel that are now Grade II listed. The school bell was donated by the Bilbie family of bell founders based in the village. Additional classrooms were built in 1926, and further alterations and extensions were built in 1970, 1995 and 2001.In July 2018, the school celebrated its 300th birthday making it one of the oldest state schools in England. A service was held at St Andrew's Church led by the Bishop of Taunton \u2013 The Right Reverend Ruth Worsley, and was followed by a tea party at the school, and the planting of a time capsule.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nDurham, I. & M.

    "Anthony Hawtrey": "Anthony John Hawtrey (22 January 1909 \u2013 18 October 1954) was an English actor and stage director. He began his acting career in 1930 and began directing by 1939. As director of  the Embassy Theatre in London, his productions sometimes achieved enough success to transfer to the West End. During his theatre career, Hawtrey also acted in television and on film. He was a member of the Terry family of actors.\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nHawtrey was born in Claygate, Surrey, the illegitimate son of the actors Sir Charles Hawtrey and Olive Morris (the daughter of Florence Terry), and was educated at Bradfield College prior to studying for the stage under Bertha Moore.\nFrom 1930 Hawtrey worked as an actor in London, on tour in South Africa, and with the Liverpool Repertory Company. He appeared as the King of France in the Old Vic's production of King Lear in 1931, when his cousin John Gielgud played Lear. In 1939 he was director of productions at the Embassy Theatre in north London, subsequently becoming director at the Swindon Repertory Company. Hawtrey then became the second manager of the Dundee Repertory Theatre, succeeding Robert Thornley as Director of Productions in December 1940. He opened with a Christmas adaptation of The Scarlet Pimpernel, and from 1940 to 1942 he directed and acted in over 40 plays in Dundee.\n\n\n=== Embassy Theatre ===\nIn January 1945 Hawtrey reopened the Embassy, which had been closed due to bomb damage, and under his directorship there followed a string of successful productions. From the first two years' output, 20 plays in all, he selected six for publication, in two volumes, under the title Embassy Successes, namely\n\nWorm's Eye View by R. F. Delderfield\nFather Malachy's Miracle adapted by Brian Doherty from the book by Bruce Marshall\nZoo in Silesia by Richard Pollock\nNational Velvet by Enid Bagnold\nSkipper Next to God by Jan de Hartog\nNo Room at the Inn by Joan Temple.Of these, Worm's Eye View and No Room at the Inn enjoyed successful transfers to the West End, at the Whitehall and Winter Garden Theatres respectively, and the plays were made into films.\nIn 1948 a third volume of Embassy Successes comprised\n\nPeace Comes to Peckham by Delderfield\nLet My People Go! by Ian Hay\nAway from It All by Val Gielgud.Further successes followed, among them the Sylvia Rayman play Women of Twilight, which proved a major hit for Hawtrey and the Embassy in 1951/52, transferring to both the Vaudeville Theatre and the Victoria Palace Theatre, and was made into a film.Introducing the first two volumes of Embassy Successes, Hawtrey wrote: \"Our policy is this. To present new plays dealing with today's world \u2013 in terms of entertainment. If these plays are written by new playwrights, so much the better. I am aware that the English theatre cannot properly thrive unless there is a constant supply of fresh dramatists. At the Embassy, we shall always do everything in our power to foster this supply.\" Val Gielgud, in the third Embassy Successes book, praised Hawtrey's \"persistent refusal to be deterred from experiment by difficulties of staging which too frequently have proved fatal to the chances of a play's production in the West End.\" According to the actor Leslie Phillips, Hawtrey \"was a charming, easy-going man with a great sense of humour and a natural instinct for popular theatre.\"\n\n\n=== Screen work ===\nIn parallel with his work in theatre, Hawtrey also acted in television productions and several films, a few of which were\n\nInquest (1939) (TV)\nWarn That Man (1943)\nHeadline (1944)\nThe Hundred Pound Window (1944)\nThe World Owes Me a Living (1945)\nLatin Quarter (1945)\nThe First Gentleman (1948)\nJulius Caesar (1951) (TV; as Mark Antony)\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nHe was married to the actress Marjorie Clark, with whom he had two sons, Charles and the actor Nicholas (1932\u20132018). He died in London of a heart attack in 1954 at the age of 45.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAnthony Hawtrey at IMDb",

    "Climate of Illinois": "The Climate of Illinois describes the weather conditions, and extremes, noted within the state of Illinois, United States, over time.\nBecause of its nearly 400-mile (640 km) length and mid-continental location, Illinois has a widely varying climate.  Most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa) with hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters.  The southernmost part of the state, from about Carbondale southward, and the eastern suburbs of St. Louis, has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from 48 inches or 1,220 mm at the southern tip to 35 inches or 890 mm in the northern portion of the state.  Normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 inches or 0.97 m in Chicago, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than 14 inches or 0.36 m. The highest temperature recorded in Illinois was 117 \u00b0F (47.2 \u00b0C), recorded on July 14, 1954, at East St. Louis, while the lowest temperature was \u221238 \u00b0F (\u221238.9 \u00b0C), recorded on January 31, 2019, at Mount Carroll.\nIllinois averages around 50 days of thunderstorm activity a year which put it somewhat above average for number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes with an average of 54 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around 9.7 tornadoes per 10,000 square miles (30,000 km2) annually. The deadliest tornado on record in the nation occurred largely in Illinois. The Tri-State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states; 613 of the victims lived in Illinois.\n\n\n== Temperatures ==\n\nDue to the urban heat island effect, cities tend to be 2 \u00b0F or 1.1 \u00b0C warmer on average, which is most noticeable overnight.\n\n\n=== Heat ===\nThe 1995 Chicago heat wave was one of the worst weather-related disasters in state history, with 525 dead within a five-day period as overnight lows remained as high as 84 \u00b0F (28.9 \u00b0C) and daytime highs reached up to 106 \u00b0F (41.1 \u00b0C).  The most deadly heatwave in the history of the United States struck Illinois during July 1936, which killed 2,656 people.\n\n\n=== Cold ===\n\nExtreme temperatures changes can occur within minutes with the passage of a strong cold front through the state.  On December 20, 1836, temperatures fell 40 \u00b0F or 22.2 \u00b0C in minutes, which supposedly froze people to their saddles and chickens in their tracks.  Until 2019, the lowest temperature was \u221237 \u00b0F (\u221238.3 \u00b0C), recorded on January 15, 2009, at Rochelle. However, Illinois did not officially recognize this measurement, as it was made from a small airport and there were no quality control procedures applied to the measurement. As a result, the official record-lowest temperature for the state was \u221236 \u00b0F (\u221237.8 \u00b0C) recorded at Congerville on 5 January 1999. In 2019, the January North American Cold Wave struck Illinois. This resulted in a new record low temperature, \u221238 \u00b0F (\u221238.9 \u00b0C), recorded on January 31, 2019, at Mount Carroll. \n\n\n== Precipitation ==\nAverage yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over 48 inches (1,200 mm) at the southern tip to just under 32 inches (810 mm) in the northern portion of the state.  May and June are the wettest months of the year.  Flooding is the most damaging weather hazard within the state.  Increased warming within urban heat islands leads to an increase in rainfall downwind of cities.  Lake Michigan leads to an increase in winter precipitation along its south shore due to lake effect snow forming over the relatively warm lakes.  In summer, the relatively cooler lake leads to a more stable atmosphere near the lake shore, reducing rainfall potential.\n\n\n=== Snowstorms ===\nWhile normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 inches (0.97 m) in Chicago, the southern portion of the state normally receives less than 14 inches (0.36 m).  The snowiest winter on record for Chicago was 89.7 inches (2.28 m) during the winter of 1978\u201379. The city has also recorded two other winters with snowfall in excess of 80 inches (2.03 m)\u20141977-78 and 2013-14. During the winter of 1830\u201331, southern sections of the state were covered with 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow, with drifts up to 6 feet (1.8 m) tall.  Storms exceeding the normal winter value are possible within one day mainly in the southern half of the state.  The heaviest snowfall recorded in Chicago history was 23 inches (0.58 m) during the Blizzard of 1967.\n\n\n=== Thunderstorms and severe weather ===\nIllinois averages around 50 days of thunderstorm activity a year which put it somewhat above average for the number of thunderstorm days for the United States.  Thunderstorms contribute over half of the annual precipitation statewide.  Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes with an average of 35 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around 5 tornadoes per 10,000 square miles (30,000 km2) annually.  Peak tornado activity occurs between April and June.    Illinois also receives the remnants of tropical cyclones which have struck the Gulf coast. One of the wetter systems, Tropical Storm Claudette, impacted the state in July 1979 bringing rainfall amounts up to 7.64 inches (194 mm).\n\n\n== See also ==\nClimate change in Illinois\nCold wave\nHeat wave\nList of wettest known tropical cyclone remnants in Illinois\nList of ecoregions in Illinois\n\n\n== References ==\n22. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/records/IL",
    "Forthmann Carriage House": "The Forthmann Carriage House, is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (No. 103) located in Angelino Heights, Los Angeles, California. It is a 1,000 sq. ft. Victorian style carriage house built c.1882, designed by Burgess J. Reeve. It was relocated in March 2006 from its original location at 629 West 18th Street. Los Angeles, California to its current location at 812 E Edgeware Rd. Los Angeles, California. The relocation was made possible thanks to the efforts of Barbara Behm, an independent developer who restored many properties in Angeleno Heights.\nSometime in the 1880s, Burgess J. Reeve designed a 4,200 square foot, eleven-room Victorian mansion for John A. Forthmann. Forthmann, a German immigrant, had made his money from founding and running the Los Angeles Soap Co. The business, most famous for its White King brand (\u201cIt takes so little\u201d), at one point covered about sixteen acres of downtown. Forthmann died in 1922.The Forthmann Carriage House is currently owned and in the process of restoration by Ithyle Griffiths and Angela Kohler.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monuments in South Los Angeles\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBig Orange Landmarks article on Forthmann House",

He also appeared in the 1999 state title game in baseball, along with the state championship game in football in 2000.\n\n\n== Professional career ==\n\n\n=== Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim ===\nMathis was drafted in the first round by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim out of high school in 2001, which he accepted in lieu of attending Florida State University. He quickly moved up the ranks, and by 2005, he was with the Salt Lake Bees at the Triple-A level. In 2005, he had a .276 batting average with 21 home runs across 111 games. Noted for his defensive skills, he also earned the Angels' minor league Defensive Player of the Year award.Following the 2005 season, the Angels declined to pursue the return of their free agent starting catcher, Bengie Molina, allowing Mathis to take Molina's spot.\n\n\n==== Major leagues ====\n\nAfter a solid 2006 spring training, Mathis was expected to see substantial playing time at catcher, sharing the position with Jos\u00e9 Molina. However, once the regular season began, he struggled greatly on both defense and offense. The Angels demoted him back to the minor leagues about one month into the season. Mathis was replaced on the Angels roster by catcher Mike Napoli, who later became a very offensive-minded catcher that transitioned to being a first baseman and designated hitter for his offensive prowess. He was later recalled back to the majors on September 1. Overall in 2006 he played 23 games, having a .145 batting average and collecting 8 hits with 2 doubles and 2 home runs.Mathis entered the 2007 season fighting for the two catcher positions with Mike Napoli and Jos\u00e9 Molina. He would end up being sent back to the minors with the Salt Lake Bees. In the beginning of July, Napoli sustained a high ankle sprain, making the Angels recall Mathis to the majors. He made his first season start on July 4 against the Texas Rangers. He went 0 for 2, ground and flying out in a 2\u20134 loss. On July 21, Molina was traded to the New York Yankees, making Napoli and Mathis hold the two catcher positions for the rest of the season. The trade also indicated the Angels\u2019 confidence in Mathis. Overall in 2007, Mathis played in 59 games, accumulating 36 hits, with 12 doubles and 4 home runs while accruing a .211 batting average.On July 23, 2008, Mathis had 4 hits and 6 RBI (the highest in a single game for both categories that season) in a 11\u201314 win against the Cleveland Indians. Mathis noted that his team's pitcher, John Lackey, \"obviously didn't have his best stuff today, but he kept battling through it... and luckily we were able to put some runs on the board for him.\" Overall in 2008, Mathis played in 94 games, the most in a single season. However, he had a batting average of .194, below the Mendoza Line.In game 3 of the 2009 American League Championship Series, Mathis hit an 11th-inning walk-off RBI double, defeating the New York Yankees 5\u20134. In spite of his poor regular season stats (.211 batting average), he used his strong playoff offensive performance and excellent defensive skill to bolster his case for a raise to $1.3 million, beating the Angels management in arbitration. The arbitration hearing was also something of a watershed in the amount of consideration paid to Mathis' defensive statistics. The LA Times highlighted the stark comparisons with competing catcher Mike Napoli: \"in 657 innings with the agile Mathis behind the plate, Angels pitchers had a 3.99 earned-run average; they had a 4.86 ERA in 758 innings with Napoli catching. Mathis also caught 17 of 69 attempted base-stealers for a 24.6% success rate; Napoli, who will make $3.6 million in 2010 but is coming off two 20-homer seasons, caught 13 of 87 attempted base-stealers for a 14.9% success rate\". Mathis had been among the AL leaders in pitchers' earned run averages while behind the plate.In 2010, Mathis was ranked by Beyond the Box Score as one of the worst defensive catchers in baseball. He also matched his career-worst batting average of .194, while posting a sub-.500 OPS in over 200 at bats.\n\n\n=== Toronto Blue Jays ===\nOn December 3, 2011, following the acquisition of Chris Iannetta, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for pitcher Brad Mills.Nine days later, Mathis signed a contract with the Blue Jays to avoid arbitration. He signed a one-year deal and was guaranteed to earn $1.5 million. Mathis made his first career pitching appearance in a game against the Texas Rangers on May 25. Pitching in the 8th inning, Mathis gave up a hit and walked a batter, but ended the inning without surrendering a run. He became the sixth position player for the Blue Jays to pitch in a game, and the first since Mike McCoy on June 11, 2011.  He made a second pitching appearance exactly two months later, mopping up in a 16-0 loss against Oakland.  In that game, Mathis gave up 3 hits and 2 runs (both earned) in 1 inning of work.\nOn August 14, 2012, Mathis was signed to a two-year contract extension worth $3 million. It included a 2015 club option worth $1.5 million. Mathis was hitting .215 with six home runs over 147 plate appearances at the time of extension.\n\n\n=== Miami Marlins ===\n\nOn November 19, 2012, Mathis was traded to the Miami Marlins along with Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson \u00c1lvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino, in exchange for Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson, Jos\u00e9 Reyes, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio. Mathis was expected to serve as the back-up to Rob Brantly.\nIn his first spring training game with the Marlins on February 23, 2013, Mathis broke his collarbone on a foul tip hit by Matt Holliday. He was the only catcher with major-league experience besides Brantly, and was expected to miss 6 weeks. Mathis made his season debut on May 16, going 0\u20134 with 2 strikeouts. On June 30, he hit a walk-off grand slam against Tyson Ross of the San Diego Padres to give Miami the win, 6\u20132. On November 1, 2014, the Marlins exercised their $1.5 million 2015 option on Mathis.On December 18, 2015, Mathis re-signed with the Marlins on a 1-year deal worth $1.5 million. He hit his third career grand slam (first since 2013) in a June 14, 2016 game against the San Diego Padres.\n\n\n=== Arizona Diamondbacks ===\nMathis signed a two-year, $4 million deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 5, 2016. During the 2017 season, he appeared in 60 games with the Diamondbacks, batting .215 with two home runs and 11 RBIs. He hit .200 with 1 home run and 20 RBI in 2018.\n\n\n=== Texas Rangers ===\nOn November 15, 2018, Mathis signed a two-year deal, with the Texas Rangers. In 2019, Mathis hit .158/.209/.224/.433 with 2 home runs and 12 RBI over 86 games. On defense, he helped Lance Lynn and Mike Minor finish in the top 10 in AL Cy Young Award voting. In 24 games in 2020 for Texas, Mathis slashed .161/.221/.355 with 3 home runs and 9 RBI over 62 at-bats.\n\n\n=== Philadelphia Phillies ===\nOn February 16, 2021, Mathis signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies organization that included an invitation to spring training. On March 24, 2021, Mathis was released from his contract with the Phillies after ten spring training games.\n\n\n=== Atlanta Braves ===\nOn March 30, 2021, Mathis signed a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves organization. On May 2, 2021, Mathis was selected to the active roster after starter Travis d'Arnaud and backup Alex Jackson were placed on the injured list. After going hitless in 9 at-bats, Mathis was designated for assignment on May 19 following the acquisition of Kevan Smith. He was outrighted to the Triple-A Gwinnett Stripers the next day.\n\n\n== Player profile ==\nAfter leaving the Angels, Mathis became a heavily defensive catcher who excels in pitch framing and catching base stealers. Because of these skills, he was a preferred catcher to pitchers such as Jose Fernandez and Zack Greinke, despite being among the league worst in many batting statistics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCareer statistics and player information from MLB, or ESPN, or Baseball-Reference, or Fangraphs, or Baseball-Reference (Minors)",
    "Albert Johan Petersson": "Albert Johan Petersson (6 February 1870 \u2013 18/19 August 1914) was a Swedish chemist, engineer and industrialist. He is most known as the developer of the Alby-furnace for producing of Calcium carbide and as the first director of the carbide and cyanamide factories in Odda in Norway. He was born in Landskrona, Sweden and probably died during a boat trip between Odda and Bergen.\n\n\n== Family and disappearance ==\nAlbert Petersson was married to the German born Leonie Witt, daughter of professor Otto Nikolaus Witt (1853\u20131915) in Berlin. Together they had two children, both born in Odda. Claus was born in 1907. Then Ingrid in 1910, in which Leonie died from childbirth complications. On 18 August 1914 Petersson went aboard the fjord steamer D/S Ullensvang in Odda. The next morning the boat arrived in Bergen and he had disappeared.

    "Keynsham": "Keynsham ( KAYN-sh\u0259m) is a town and civil parish located between Bristol and Bath in Somerset, England. It has a population of 16,000.\nIt was listed in the Domesday Book as Cainesham (as it is pronounced), which is believed to mean the home of Saint Keyne.\nThe site of the town has been occupied since prehistoric times, and may have been the site of the Roman settlement of Trajectus. The remains of at least two  Roman villas have been excavated, and an additional 15 Roman buildings have been detected beneath the Keynsham Hams. Keynsham developed into a medieval market town after Keynsham Abbey was founded around 1170. It is situated at the confluence of the River Chew and River Avon and was subject to serious flooding before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock in 1727. The Chew Stoke flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town. It was home to the Cadbury's chocolate factory, Somerdale, which opened in 1935 as a major employer in the town.\nIt is home to Memorial Park, which is used for the annual town festival and several nature reserves. The town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes and is close to the A4 road which bypassed the town in 1964. There are schools, religious, sporting, and cultural clubs and venues.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Roman Trajectus ===\n\nEvidence of occupation dates back to prehistoric times, and during the Roman period, Keynsham may have been the site of the Roman settlement of Trajectus, which is the Latin word for \"bridgehead.\" It is believed that a settlement around a Roman ford over the River Avon existed somewhere in the vicinity, and the numerous Roman ruins discovered in Keynsham make it a likely candidate for this lost settlement.\nIn 1877 during construction of the Durley Hill Cemetery, the remains of a grand Roman villa with over 30 rooms was discovered. However, construction of the cemetery went ahead, and the majority of the villa is now located beneath the Victorian cemetery and an adjacent road. The cemetery was expanded in 1922, and an archeological dig was carried out ahead of the interments, leading to the excavation of 17 rooms and the rescue of 10 elaborate mosaics.At the same time as the grand Roman villa was being excavated at Durley Hill Cemetery, a second smaller villa was discovered during the construction of Fry's Somerdale Chocolate Factory. Two fine stone coffins were found, interred with the remains of a man and a woman. The villa and coffins were removed to a place near the gates of the factory grounds, and construction on the factory went ahead. Fry's built in the grounds of the factory a museum which for many years housed the Durley Hill mosaics, the coffins, and numerous other artefacts. In 2012, Taylor Wimpey, about to develop the factory site, made a detailed geophysical assessment of the area, and discovered an additional 15 Roman buildings centered around a Roman road beneath Keynsham Hams, with evidence of additional Roman buildings that had been disturbed by quarrying.\n\n\n=== Medieval Keynsham ===\nAccording to legend, Saint Keyne, daughter of King Brychan of Brycheiniog (Brecon), lived here on the banks of the River Avon during the 5th century.  Before settling here, she had been warned by the local King that the marshy area was swarming with snakes, which prevented habitation. St Keyne prayed to the heavens and turned the snakes to stone.  The fossil ammonites found in the area were believed to be the result. However, there is no evidence that her cult was ever celebrated in Keynsham.\nSome scattered archeological evidence suggests that an Anglo-Saxon settlement existed in Keynsham in the High Street area, and that in the 9th century a Minster church existed in Keynsham as well. The earliest documentary reference to Keynsham is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, (c. 980) which refers to it as C\u00e6gineshamme, Old English for 'C\u00e6ga's Hamm.' The town is also listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \"Cainesham.\" It has therefore been suggested that the origin of Keynsham's name is not, in fact Saint Keyne, but from \"Ceagin (Caega).\"Around 1170, Keynsham Abbey was founded by the Victorine congregation of canon regulars. Archeological evidence suggests that the abbey was built over the site of the previous Saxon Minster church. The settlement developed into a medieval market town, and the abbey of Keynsham was given ownership of the Keynsham Hundred.\nThe Abbey survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, and a house was subsequently built on the site. The remains have been designated as a Grade I listed building by English Heritage.\n\n\n=== Stuart era ===\nKeynsham played a part in the Civil War as the Roundheads saved the town and also camped there for the night, using the pub now known as the Lock Keeper Inn as a guard post. During the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685 the town was the site of a battle between royalist forces and the rebel Duke of Monmouth. Bridges Almshouses were built around 1685 and may have been for the widows of those killed in the rebellion.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nKeynsham rose to fame during the late 1950s and early 1960s when it featured in a long-running series of advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for Horace Batchelor's Infra-draw betting system. To obtain the system, listeners had to write to Batchelor's Keynsham post office box, and Keynsham was always painstakingly spelled out on-air, with Batchelor famously intoning \"Keynsham \u2013 spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M \u2013 Keynsham, Bristol\". This was done because the proper pronunciation of Keynsham \u2013 \"Cane-sham\" \u2013 does not make the spelling of Keynsham immediately obvious to the radio listener.Since the 1950s Keynsham has become a dormitory town for Bristol and Bath. The High Street shopping area has been remodelled, and a Town Hall, Library, and Clock Tower were built in the mid-1960s.Before the creation of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated large parts of the town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the flood the Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.\n\n\n=== 2010s regeneration ===\nDesign work for regeneration of the town hall area was awarded by Bath and North East Somerset Council to Aedas in 2010, with the works cost stated in 2011 to be \u00a333 million (\u00a334 million in 2012). Realisation of the plans is hoped to \"attract new business and jobs\", in the aftermath of the announcement of the Cadbury Somerdale Factory closure.In January 2012, it was announced that the Willmott Dixon Group had been appointed as contractor on the scheme. The Council's planning committee in August 2012 deferred the approval decision, pending alterations to the external appearance of the building. These were approved in October 2012, with demolition commencing in the same month. The regenerated Civic Centre area came back into use in late 2014 and early 2015.In the latter half of the 2010s, Keynsham underwent rapid expansion with hundreds of new homes built.\n\n\n== Governance ==\n\nThe town council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council\u2019s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The town council's role includes projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning.\nPlaying fields and playgrounds are provided in Memorial Park, Downfield, Kelston Road, Teviot Road, Holmoak Road and Manor Road with basketball facilities at Teviot Road and Holmoak Road and a BMX track at Keynsham Road. The Keynsham town council is also responsible for the football pitches and pavilion at Manor Road  and the floodlit Multi Sport Site in Memorial Park. It also provides support for community groups organising music and cultural events. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The town council was formed in 1991 and consists of 15 members elected every four years. There are  2 Labour and 13 Conservative.  Keynsham has one official twin town: Libourne in France.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1996, Keynsham was administered as part of the short-lived county of Avon; it has since formed part of the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset, in the ceremonial county of Somerset. Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, was established by the Local Government Act 1992. The town is divided into Keynhsam North, which has five Conservative councillors, Keynsham South which is represented by three Conservative and two Labour councillors, and Keynsham East, which has the remaining 5 councillors, all of whom are Conservatives.Bath and North East Somerset provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.\nBath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in Bath, but many departments are headquartered in Keynsham. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the main town of the Wansdyke district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 the parish was part of the Keynsham Urban District.The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North East Somerset constituency, which is a county constituency created by the Boundary Commission for England as the successor seat to the Wansdyke Parliamentary Seat. It came into being at the 2010 general election, and is represented by the Conservative Jacob Rees-Mogg. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nKeynsham is located where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing rights for the Millground and Chewton sections of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to chub, roach, European perch and rudd, along with good numbers of gudgeon, dace and trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. Just above the lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the River Chew.\n\nMemorial Park, the northern part of which has existed as parkland since the 19th century, as shown by the ordnance Survey maps of 1864 and 1867, was formally laid out after World War II was extended after the floods of 1968. It covers 10.7 hectares (26 acres) of woodland and grass alongside the River Chew. It commemorates the war dead of Keynsham and includes facilities including two children's play areas, a skateboard park, multi-sport area, bowling green, public toilets, a bandstand and refreshment kiosk. The formal gardens within the park are adjacent to the River Chew with the Dapps Hill Woods at its western end. Part of the park is known locally as Chew Park because of its proximity to the river and another area, close to Keynsham Abbey as Abbey Park. The park received the Green Flag Award in 2008/09, and again for 2009/10.\n\nOn the outskirts of Keynsham lies Keynsham Humpy Tumps, one of the most floristically rich acidic grassland sites within the Avon area. The site is on a south-facing slope running alongside the Bristol to Bath railway line. It consists of open patches of grassland and bare rock, interspersed with blocks of scrub. It is the only site in Avon at which upright chickweed Moenchia erecta, occurs. Other locally notable plant species found here include annual knawel Scleranthus annuus, sand spurrey Spergularia rubra, subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneus and prickly sedge Carex muricata ssp. lamprocarpa. The site does not have any statutory conservation status, and is not managed for its biodiversity interest. Threats to its ecological value include the encroachment of scrub onto the grassland areas, and damage from motorcycle scrambling. Between Keynsham and Saltford, a 15 hectares (37 acres) area of green belt has been planted, with over 19,000 trees, as the Manor Road Community Woodland, which has been designated as a Nature Reserve. Nearby is the Avon Valley Country Park tourist attraction.\nAlong with the rest of South West England, Keynsham has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but due to the modifying effect of the sea, the range is less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 \u00b0C (34 \u00b0F) and 2 \u00b0C (36 \u00b0F). July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK.Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800\u2013900 mm (31\u201335 in). About 8\u201315 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest. The predominant wind direction is from the south west.\n\n\n== Demography ==\n\nIn the 2001 census Keynsham had a population of 15,533, in 6,545 households, of which 6,480 described themselves as White. Keynsham East Ward had a population of 5,479, Keynsham North 5,035 and Keynsham South 5,019. In each of the wards between 75 and 80% of the population described themselves as Christians, and around 15% said that they had no religion.\nIn 1881 the population of the civil parish was 2,482. This grew gradually until 1931 when there were 4,521, before there was a steeper rise to 1951 when there were 8,277. Over the next ten years this nearly doubled to 15,152 in 1961.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAn important industry in the town was Cadbury's chocolate factory, the Somerdale Factory. The J. S. Fry & Sons business merged with Cadbury in 1919, and moved their factory in the centre of Bristol to Keynsham in 1935. As Quakers, Cadbury's built the factory on a 228-acre (0.92 km2) greenfield site with social facilities, including playing fields and recreational sports grounds. Called Somerdale after a national competition in 1923, Keynsham Cadbury was the home of Fry's Chocolate Cream, the Double Decker, Dairy Milk and Mini Eggs, Cadbury's Fudge, Chomp and Crunchie.On 3 October 2007, Cadbury announced plans to close the Somerdale plant by 2010 with the loss of some 500 jobs. Production was to be moved to factories in Birmingham and Poland, and in the longer term it was expected that the site would be redeveloped for housing. Labour MP for Wansdyke, Dan Norris, said \"news of the factory's closure is a hard and heavy blow, not just to the workforce, but to the Keynsham community as a whole\". By late 2007 campaigns to save the Cadbury's factory in Somerdale were in full swing, and one local resident started a campaign to urge English Heritage to protect the site and preserve the history of the factory.\nIn 2009 the US corporation Kraft made a takeover bid for Cadbury Schweppes.  Cadbury's were seen as iconic of British manufacturing industry, and the bid became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of national interest.  To sweeten their case before the Monopolies Commission, Kraft made a pledge to keep the Cadbury factory at Somerdale open if they were successful in their bid for the company; and their bid was duly successful. However, within a week of completing their purchase of Cadbury, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld released a statement announcing that Kraft were to close the factory by 2011, as originally planned by Cadbury. The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury's plans were, but industry experts questioned this, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that they should have been aware of the extent to which plans had been advanced.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nIn 1969 the town was featured as the title of the fourth album Keynsham by the Bonzo Dog Band. The title was chosen in honour of Horace Batchelor, who had been referenced in previous Bonzo Dog Band recordings. In the early 1960s, Batchelor became known through his regular advertisements on Radio Luxembourg for his football pools prediction service. When giving his contact address, he would slowly spell out 'Keynsham' letter by letter, and this became an amusing feature for many young listeners.\nKeynsham Festival, which started in the late 1990s, takes place in the Memorial Park each July, and attracts around 16,000 people.  There is also a Victorian evening held in the town each November. This has since been renamed Keynsham Winter Festival. Keynsham and Saltford local history society was formed in 1965 and is concerned with researching and recording the history of the area.Keynsham was chosen as the outdoor location for a dramatic story-line in the BBC One TV serial EastEnders in September 2012 with filming taking place in a cordoned-off section of the High Street.In Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen, Catherine and her friends ride to \u2033within view of the town of Keynsham\u2033.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\nThe town is served by Keynsham railway station on the London-Bristol and Bristol-Southampton trunk routes. It opened in 1840 and was renamed Keynsham and Somerdale in 1925. The chocolate factory had its own rail system which was connected to the main line, but the connection was taken out of use 26\u201327 July 1980. The station's name reverted to Keynsham on 6 May 1974. The station was rebuilt in 1985 as a joint project between British Rail and Avon County Council.The A4 trunk road used to run through the town, but much of this traffic is now carried on the bypass, which was constructed in 1964.  The bypass runs from Saltford, a village which adjoins Keynsham, to Brislington in Bristol. Keynsham is about 10 miles (16 km) from junction 1 of the M32 via the Avon Ring Road A4174 and provides a fast route to the M4 and M5.\nKeynsham is on the Monarch's Way long distance footpath which approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651 after being defeated in the Battle of Worcester.In May 2017, the High Street was made one-way for traffic heading towards Saltford and Bath with all Bristol-bound diverted along Ashton Way. There is now no access to Temple Street from High Street with the exception of buses and taxis, all traffic for Temple Street is diverted along Ashton Way.\nThe town is served by 6 bus routes, 1 of which connects Bath with Bristol International Airport, another bus service runs from Ashton Way at the back of the shops to Southmead Hospital and one bus service runs to Cribbs Causeway. In numerical order:\n\nA4 Bath to Bristol Airport\n17 Keynsham to Southmead Hospital\n18 Bath to Cribbs Causeway\n39 Bath to Bristol\n178 Radstock to Bristol\n349 Keynsham to BristolAll buses towards Bristol, Southmead and Cribbs Causeway use the bus stop on Ashton Way at the back of the shops, whilst all buses towards Bath use the stop on the High Street opposite the Post Office.\n\n\n== Education ==\nState-funded schools are organised within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset. A review of Secondary Education in Bath was started in 2007, primarily to reduce surplus provision and reduce the number of single-sex secondary schools in Bath, and to access capital funds available through the government's Building Schools for the Future programme. There are four primary schools in Keynsham, St John\u2019s Primary School, Castle Primary School, Chandag (Infants and Junior schools) and St Keyna Primary School (formed when Keynsham Primary School and 150 year old Temple Primary School merged in 2007). There are also three secondary schools: Wellsway; Broadlands; and IKB Academy.\n\nWellsway School is an 11\u201318, mixed comprehensive school which was established in 1971, by amalgamating Keynsham Grammar School and Wellsway County Secondary School both of which opened on a shared site in the mid-1950s. Most students that attend the school live in Keynsham and Saltford or the nearby villages. As of 2014, approximately 1335 students attend the school, ranging in age of 11\u201318, with 64% achieving 5 or more A-C grades at GCSE. Wellsway's bid for specialist school status was accepted in September 2007. Meaning that Wellsway School now specialises as a Sports and Science College. This means the School has joined the national network of specialist schools, resulting in every school in Bath and North East Somerset now having a specialism. A joint bid is unusual as there are only six schools in the country with a combined Sports and Science specialism.\nBroadlands Academy became an academy in 2012. It has 430 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years.IKB Academy opened in September 2015, and has a focus on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Maths (STEM) subjects. It is a studio school for pupils aged 14\u201319, and offers GCSEs, A Levels, and BTECs, in conjunction with weekly or fortnightly work placements.\nNearby Bath has two universities. The University of Bath was established in 1966. It is known, academically, for the physical sciences, mathematics, architecture, management and technology. Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college (Bath Spa University College), before being granted university status in August 2005. It has schools in Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, and Social Sciences. The city contains one further education college, City of Bath College, and several sixth forms as part of both state, private, and public schools. In England, on average in 2006, 45.8% of pupils gained 5 grades A-C including English and Maths; for Bath and North East Somerset pupils taking GCSE at 16 it is 52.0%. Special needs education is provided by Three Ways School.\n\n\n== Religious sites ==\n\nBegun in 1292, the Church of England parish church of St John the Baptist, Keynsham gradually evolved until taking its present general form during the reign of Charles I, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and is said to have been built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634\u20131655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.A former organ is said to have stood in the church, but \"had tones so mellow\" that Handel bargained for it, offering a peal of bells in exchange. The offer was accepted. The musician went off with the organ and the bells were delivered. There are eight bells in total, some made by the Bilbie family of Chew Stoke, the smallest bears these lines:\n\n\"I value not who doth me see\nFor Thomas Bilbie casted me;\nAlthow my sound it is but small\nI can be heard amongst you all.\"\n\nSt John the Baptist church is one of five churches in the Church of England Parish of Keynsham, the others being the village churches of St Michael's in Burnett and St Margaret's in Queen Charlton, the \"Mission Church\" in Chewton Keynsham (formerly the school building), and St Francis' Church on the Park Estate which in 2013 - 2015 underwent extensive modernisation and offers two halls for use by community groups.\nThere are also the Victoria and Queens Road Methodist churches, St Dunstan's Roman Catholic Church and an Elim Church.  The churches work together, also with churches in Saltford, under the banner of \"Churches Together in Keynsham and Saltford\" and often with the strapline \"More to Life\".\n\n\n== Sport ==\nKeynsham Cricket Club play at the Frank Taylor Memorial Ground, their 1st XI compete in the West of England Premier League Division 2. Marcus Trescothick is the most noticeable player to have played for the club. His family remain members of the club, which incorporates over 100 senior members and 100 junior members.\nKeynsham rugby football club play at Crown Field. The club's most notable and tragic event occurred on 24 December 1992, when there was a fatal road accident outside the club's ground. A Ford Fiesta car ploughed into 11 people leaving the annual festive disco. One woman, 21-year-old Sarah Monnelle, died at the scene. A second person, 24-year-old rugby player Richard Barnett, died in hospital two days later from his injuries. Clive Sutton was later found guilty on a double charge of causing death by dangerous driving and sentenced to four years in prison at Bristol Crown Court.Keynsham Town F.C. were founded in 1895. They have played continuously apart from a break during World War II and moved to their current ground, the Crown Field, in 1945. They first played in the Bristol & District League and progressed through the Bristol Combination, Bristol Premier and Somerset Senior League and won the Somerset Senior Cup in 1951\u201352 and 1957\u201358. They were elected to the Western League in 1973 but were relegated three years later in 1976. Since then they have been promoted to the Premier Division three times and relegated three times. They won the Somerset Senior Cup for the third time in 2002\u201303 and reached the 5th round of the FA Vase in 2003\u201304. They currently play in the Western Football League Division 1.There is a bowls club situated at the Memorial Park. The Fry Tennis Club has courts located within the town's Somerdale estate. Keynsham leisure centre was built in 1965 by British Gas as a gift to the town. It includes a swimming pool, gymnasium and sauna.\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nSeveral notable people have been born or lived in Keynsham. The comedian Bill Bailey was raised in the town. Another entertainer Neil Forrester, who was a research assistant and became known as a cast member on The Real World: London was also a local. Celebrated children's author Mimi Thebo has been resident since 2002.

    "Shaun Williams (wrestler)": "Shaun Phillip Williams (born December 5, 1976 in Pretoria) is a retired amateur South African freestyle wrestler, who competed in the men's featherweight category. Williams has claimed three medals (two silver and one bronze) at the All-Africa Games, picked up a bronze in the 55-kg division at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, and later represented his nation South Africa, as a lone wrestler, at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Williams also trained for the University of Oregon's freestyle wrestling team, under his coach Pat Whidcomb, while studying and attending college in the United States.Williams emerged himself into the international spotlight at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, United Kingdom, where he took home the bronze medal in the men's featherweight division (55 kg). The following year, Williams continued to produce another sporting success by bringing home the African championship title in freestyle wrestling, and by ending up eleventh in the same class at the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States, which earned him a ticket to compete for the South African Olympic team.At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Williams qualified as a lone wrestler for the South African squad in the men's featherweight class (55 kg), by receiving a berth and rounding out the top eleven spot from the World Championships. He lost his opening bout against Bulgaria's Radoslav Velikov because of the ten-point superiority limit, and could not gain enough points to outclass China's Li Zhengyu in a sudden-death match 4\u20135, leaving Williams on the bottom of the prelim pool and finishing seventeenth overall in the final standings.After his retirement from the sport in late 2007, Williams worked as the wrestling head coach for Hermiston High School in Hermiston, Oregon. In late 2015, Williams moved to Spokane, Washington, and began work for Central Valley High School in Spokane Valley, Washington, where he started a new role as a resource education teacher, in addition to his role serving as the school\u2019s current wrestling head coach.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of University of Oregon alumni\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nProfile \u2013 International Wrestling Database",

He graduated from the Berlin Cadet Corps and served initially in the Semenov Regiment of the Imperial Guards. However, in 1884 he transferred to the Imperial Russian Navy and graduated from the Sea Cadets in 1884. He commanded a number of destroyers in the Baltic Fleet, and was awarded the Order of St Anna, 3rd class in 1896. In 1898 he graduated from the naval academy and was promoted to captain, 2nd class. Lieven was assigned to the battleship Poltava from 1898 to 1901.\nIn 1900, Lieven was sent as a military attach\u00e9 to the United States, and acted as a military observer during the Spanish\u2013American War. He was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 2nd degree the same year, followed by the Order of St Anna, 2nd degree and the Order of St Vladimir, 4th degree with bow, in 1903.\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War, Lieven was initially in command of the mine defenses of Port Arthur, followed by the gunboat Bobr. He was subsequent appointed captain of the cruiser Diana. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, he was one of the few captains to break the Japanese blockade, and was interned in Saigon, French Indochina until the end of the war. For this feat, he was awarded the Gold Sword for Bravery and was promoted to captain, 1st rank.\nAfter the end of the war, Lieven became captain of the cruiser Pamiat Azova in 1906. From 1908, he was assigned to the Navy General Staff and chaired a commission recording the events of the war. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1911, and to vice admiral in 1912 and chief of the Navy General Staff. Lieven was active in efforts to reconstruct the Imperial Russian Navy, but died near Udine railway station in Italy while returning from a vacation in Venice while aboard a train for St Petersburg.

    "Magic Carpet Ride (Steppenwolf song)": "\"Magic Carpet Ride\" is a rock song written by John Kay and Rushton Moreve from the Canadian-American hard rock band Steppenwolf. The song was initially released in 1968 on the album The Second. It was the lead single from that album, peaking at number three in the US, and staying in the charts for 16 weeks, longer than any other Steppenwolf song.The 45 rpm version is not only an edit of the album version, but contains a different vocal take on the first verse. Despite the single's popularity, the album version enjoyed heavy airplay on FM radio and is still the preferred version on most classic rock stations, as well as the one most commonly included on compilations and in popular media.\n\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nWhen preparing to record the band's second album, The Second, bassist Rushton Moreve came up with a \"bouncy riff\". Band member Jerry Edmonton's brother, Mars Bonfire, started playing guitar, and the band developed the riff. For the introduction, guitarist Michael Monarch created feedback which was spliced on to the beginning of the band's recording. John Kay had recently bought a new top-quality hi-fi system, and started writing lyrics \"about how great our new stereo system sounded,\" adding imagery about making a wish. After completing the lyrics and recording the vocal track, Kay overdubbed a falsetto, and sound engineer Bill Cooper spliced an extra chorus at the end of the track. Despite denying that the song was a reference to experiences of drug addiction, Kay did admit to the Wall Street Journal in 2016 that \"I may have smoked a joint\" the night he and Monarch got the idea for the song. Kay also alleged the lyrics went beyond referencing the quality of the new stereo and were also a reference to his relationship with his wife Jutta and envisioning that he had made a wish with Aladdin's lamp.Billboard described the single as a \"pulsating rocker\" with similar sales potential to Steppenwolf's earlier single, \"Born to Be Wild\".\n\n\n== Chart history ==\n\n\n== Cover versions ==\nA 1978 version by the South African group Buffalo spent 12 weeks on the Springbok Radio charts, peaking at number five.\nBilly Paul on his 1971 album Going East covered the song.\nCreative Source on their eponymous album covered the song.\nGrandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, on the 1988 album, On the Strength.\nA Latin pop cover, sung in Spanish and English by Myra, was included on the 2000 Disney album La Vida Mickey.\nThe version was remixed by Philip Steir for the video games Triple Play 2001 and Dance Dance Revolution Universe.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSteppenwolf - Magic Carpet Ride on YouTube\nBuffalo - Magic Carpet Ride on YouTube",

    "Faro shuffle": "The faro shuffle (American), weave shuffle (British), or dovetail shuffle is a method of shuffling playing cards, in which half of the deck is held in each hand with the thumbs inward, then cards are released by the thumbs so that they fall to the table interleaved.  Diaconis, Graham, and Kantor also call this the technique, when used in magic.\n\nMathematicians use the term \"faro shuffle\" to describe a precise rearrangement of a deck into two equal piles of 26 cards which are then interwoven perfectly.\n\n\n== Description ==\nA right-handed practitioner holds the cards from above in the left hand and from below in the right hand. The deck is separated into two preferably equal parts by simply lifting up half the cards with the right thumb slightly and pushing the left hand's packet forward away from the right hand. The two packets are often crossed and tapped against each other to align them. They are then pushed together on the short sides and bent either up or down. The cards will then alternately fall onto each other, ideally alternating one by one from each half, much like a zipper. A flourish can be added by springing the packets together by applying pressure and bending them from above.A game of Faro ends with the cards in two equal piles that the dealer must combine to deal them for the next game.  According to the magician John Maskelyne, the above method was used, and he calls it the \"faro dealer's shuffle\".  Maskelyne was the first to give clear instructions, but the shuffle was used and associated with faro earlier, as discovered mostly by the mathematician and magician Persi Diaconis.\n\n\n== Perfect shuffles ==\nA faro shuffle that leaves the original top card at the top and the original bottom card at the bottom is known as an out-shuffle, while one that moves the original top card to second and the original bottom card to second from the bottom is known as an in-shuffle.  These names were coined by the magician and computer programmer Alex Elmsley. A perfect faro shuffle, where the cards are perfectly alternated, requires the shuffler to cut the deck into two equal stacks and apply just the right pressure when pushing the half decks into each other.\nThe faro shuffle is a controlled shuffle that does not fully randomize a deck. If one can do perfect in-shuffles, then 26 shuffles will reverse the order of the deck and 26 more will restore it to its original order.In general, \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   perfect in-shuffles will restore the order of an \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  -card deck if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \u2261\n        1\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          n\n          +\n          1\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{k}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {n+1}}}\n  . For example, 52 consecutive in-shuffles restore the order of a 52-card deck, because \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            52\n          \n        \n        \u2261\n        1\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          53\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{52}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {53}}}\n  .\nIn general, \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n   perfect out-shuffles will restore the order of an \n  \n    \n      \n        n\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle n}\n  -card deck if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            k\n          \n        \n        \u2261\n        1\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          n\n          \u2212\n          1\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{k}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {n-1}}}\n  . For example, if one manages to perform eight out-shuffles in a row, then the deck of 52 cards will be restored to its original order, because \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          2\n          \n            8\n          \n        \n        \u2261\n        1\n        \n          \n          (\n          mod\n          \n          51\n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 2^{8}\\equiv 1{\\pmod {51}}}\n  .  However, only 6 faro out-shuffles are required to restore the order of a 64-card deck.\nIn other words, the number of in shuffles required to return a deck of cards of even size N, to original order is given by the multiplicative order of 2 modulo (N + 1).\nFor example, for a deck size of N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ..., the number of in shuffles needed are: 2, 4, 3, 6, 10, 12, 4, 8, 18, 6, 11, ... (sequence A002326 in the OEIS).\nAccording to Artin's conjecture on primitive roots, it follows that there are infinitely many deck sizes which require the full set of n shuffles.The analogous operation to an out shuffle for an infinite sequence is the interleave sequence.\n\n\n=== Example ===\nFor simplicity, we will use a deck of six cards.\nThe following shows the order of the deck after each in shuffle of an in-shuffle. Notice that a deck of this size returns to its original order after 3 in shuffles.\n\nThe following shows the order of the deck after each out shuffle. Notice that a deck of this size returns to its original order after 4 out shuffles.\n\n\n== As deck manipulation ==\nMagician Alex Elmsley discovered that a controlled series of in- and out-shuffles can be used to move the top card of the deck down into any desired position. The trick is to express the card's desired position as a binary number, and then do an in-shuffle for each 1 and an out-shuffle for each 0.\nFor example, to move the top card down so that there are ten cards above it, express the number ten in binary (10102). Shuffle in, out, in, out. Deal ten cards off the top of the deck; the eleventh will be your original card. Notice that it doesn't matter whether you express the number ten as 10102 or 000010102; preliminary out-shuffles will not affect the outcome because out-shuffles always keep the top card on top.\n\n\n== Group theory aspects ==\nIn mathematics, a perfect shuffle can be considered an element of the symmetric group.\nMore generally, in \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          S\n          \n

In their 27th season under head coach Amos Alonzo Stagg, the Maroons compiled a 4\u20136\u20131 record, finished in last place in the Big Ten Conference, but still outscored their opponents by a combined total of 128 to 91. No Chicago players were selected to the first team of that All-America or All-Big Ten teams.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\n\n\n== Quarantine and travel restrictions ==\nIn late September 1918, the Big Ten's faculty committee suspended the conference's activities as a controlling body during the period of emergency and agreed to be governed by any rules of the War Department.In early October, the War Department announced quarantine and travel restrictions which included the following: (1) a prohibition on more than one-and-a-half hours per day of football practice; (2) a prohibition on football games during the month of October that required absence from campus \"for a longer period than from noon to taps on Saturday\" (thus eliminating games that required lengthy travel); and (3) making allowance for only four November games per school, two at home and two on the road, \"which shall in no case involve longer absences than from retreat Friday to taps Sunday.\"The restrictions threatened to \"kill\" football in the west, where lengthy travel was required. Many games were canceled, and concerns over spread of the 1918 flu pandemic also led to limitations on public gatherings and resulted in some games being canceled and others being played in stadiums with closed gates and no spectators.\n\n\n== Games summaries ==\nOn Saturday, October 12, 1918, Chicago lost to Chicago Naval Reserve by a 14\u20137 score at Stagg Field in Chicago. The Naval Reserve School was established on Chicago's Municipal Pier in June 1918.On Wednesday, October 16, 1918, Chicago played the first of four midweek practice games. The Maroons defeated Crane Tech College, 46\u20130, at Stagg Field in Chicago. Amos Alonzo Stagg, Jr., made his college football debut in the game. Due to the influenza epidemic, city official forbade further athletic contests after this game.On Friday, October 18, 1918, in an \"unadvertised crowdless practice game\", Chicago defeated Hyde Park High School, 41\u20130. Amos Alonzo Stagg, Jr., \"ran the team for three quarters.\"On Tuesday, October 29, 1918, Chicago played the second of four midweek practice games. This time, the Maroons defeated the Loyola Academy prep school, 6\u20130. Amos Alonzo Stagg, Jr., sustained a broken collar bone in the game.On Saturday, November 2, 1918, Purdue defeated Chicago, 7\u20133, at Lafayette, Indiana. The Purdue victory broke a 20-game losing streak against Chicago dating back to 1898.  According to a newspaper account, Chicago's coach Stagg \"used everything at his command to put a winning score across, but the plucky Purdue men foiled him.\"On Wednesday, November 6, 1918, Chicago played the third of four midweek practice games. The Maroons played a scoreless tie with the Crane College S.A.T.C. on the Midway practice field. The game ended five minutes into the second half, because the Crane soldiers had to return to their barracks. A \"ghost ball\" was put into play late in the game because of the darkness on the field.On Saturday, November 9, 1918, Michigan defeated Chicago, 13\u20130, at Stagg Field in Chicago. The two teams, which had been one another's principal rivals from 1892 to 1905, had not met for 13 years. The game was played as negotiations were underway to end World War I, and the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \"While the nations of the world are hoping for an armistice, the resumption of hostilities between forces guided by Gens. Yost and Stagg brought joy to thousands of football fans, and the opening battle attracted approximately 7,000 of them.\" Chicago's Stegman attempted a dropkick from the 45-yard line, but Goetz broke through the Chicago line and blocked the kick. Goetz picked it up an returned it 55 yards for a touchdown.On Saturday, November 16, 1918, Northwestern defeated Chicago, 21\u20136, in the rain, fog, and mud before a crowd of 8,000 at Evanston Field.On Wednesday, November 19, 1918, Chicago played the fourth of four midweek practice games. The Maroons defeated a YMCA college team, 19-0, at Stagg Field in Chicago.On Saturday, November 23, 1918, Illinois defeated Chicago, 29\u20130, at Stagg Field in Chicago.On Saturday, November 30, 1918, Minnesota defeated Chicago, 6\u20130, in Chicago. Gus Ekberg scored the game's only points on a run in the second quarter. The result was Minnesota's fifth consecutive victory over Chicago.\n\n\n== References ==",

    "Titus Andronicus (ballad)": "\"The Lamentable and Tragical History of Titus Andronicus,\" also called \"Titus Andronicus' Complaint,\" is a ballad from the 17th century about the fictional Roman general, Titus, and his revenge cycle with the Queen of the Goths. Events in the ballad take place near the end of the Roman Empire, and the narrative of the ballad parallels the plot of William Shakespeare's play Titus Andronicus. Scholarly debate exists as to which text may have existed first, the ballad or the play (indeed, there is a third potential Titus Andronicus source, a prose history published in chapbook form during the 18th century). The ballad itself was first entered on the Stationers' Register in 1594, the same year the play was entered. Surviving copies of the ballad can be found in the British Library, in the Huntington Library, and at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Online copies of the facsimiles are also available for public consumption at sites such as the English Broadside Ballad Archive.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nNarrated by Titus Andronicus himself, the ballad begins with Titus addressing \"noble Minds, & famous Martial Wights / That in Defense of Native Countries fights\" (lines 1-2). Titus thus invokes an audience sympathetic with nationalistic sentiments, and he goes on to explain his victorious return to Rome from wars with the Goths. He describes bringing with him the Queen of the Goths, her two sons, and a Moor as his prisoners; however, upon presenting them to the Emperor of Rome, the Emperor makes the Queen his wife, which enables her and her sons to seek revenge on Titus. Acting in conspiracy with the Moor, the Queen frames Titus's sons for the murder of the Emperor's son, and the Queen's sons rape and mutilate Titus's daughter, Lavinia. After the rape, the Moor manipulates Titus into cutting off his right hand to redeem his sons, but his sons are killed regardless, and their hearts are sent to Titus as a taunt. In an attempt to revenge himself, Titus kills the Queen's sons and, with Lavinia's help, bakes them into a pie to feed to the Queen. In the ballads penultimate stanza, after feeding the pies of her sons' flesh to the Queen, Titus kills Lavinia, the Queen, the Emperor, and eventually himself. The final stanza, still spoken by Titus, documents the Moor's punishment, calling it a just end for all murderers: the Moor was buried into the ground, standing, so that he might starve to death.\n\n\n== Surviving Copies ==\nA number of printed copies of the ballad survive in various special collections: In the British Library, the Roxburghe collection, which houses about 1,500 ballads, possesses a copy of the ballad, estimated to be ca. 1683\u20131693; the Huntington Library, a much smaller but still significant collection of ballads, has a copy estimated to have been printed somewhere between 1725 and 1769; and the Pepys collection at Magdalene College houses two copies of the ballad, ca. 1684-1686 and 1624.\n\n\n== Form ==\n\n\n=== Language ===\nOn three of the four surviving ballads, the full title is quite long: \"The Lamentable and Tragical History of Titus Andronicus; with the Fall of his 25 sons, in the Wars with the Goths, with the manner of the Ravishment of his Daughter Lavinia, by the Empresses two Sons, through the means of a bloody Moor, taken by the sword of Titus, in the War: with his Revenge upon their cruel and inhumane Act.\" The fourth ballad, from the Pepys collection ca. 1624, is titled only \"Titus Andronicus Complaint.\"\nThe ballad is mostly composed in iambic pentameter, rather than the traditional ballad meter. The ballad has an AABB rhyme scheme, with thirty quatrains composing the ballad.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nThe ballad follows a popular ballad tune from the period, that of Fortune my Foe. Each existing broadside designates Fortune my Foe as the correct tune with a notation just beneath or next to the title of the ballad.\n\n\n=== Print ===\nLike many ballads, the surviving copies in the Roxburghe, Huntington, and Pepys collections are printed on broadside sheets in blackletter, or what we mostly commonly now call gothic, type. Three of the four surviving copies also have a woodcut illustration on the broadside. Like many broadside ballads, the woodcuts are not necessarily tailored to the narrative of the ballad, as woodcuts were often reused by printers.Of the three surviving woodcuts on the copies of the Titus ballad, only one clearly depicts scenes narrated within the ballad. The ballad facsimile in the Roxburghe collection, for instance, shows a crowd watching a homecoming procession of some kind; however, while a homecoming moment is certainly one Titus narrates, nothing in the woodcut distinctly proves that the homecoming is that of Titus Andronicus. Similarly, the woodcut on the Huntington's broadside facsimile illustrates a scene which is delineated as a moment, not from Titus's tale, but from classical epic. This woodcut portrays a duel between two men, and it labels the two men as Hector and Ajax, both characters from Homer's Iliad. One of the woodcuts from the Pepys collection, however, does depict various scenes that are clearly moments from Titus's narrative. This woodcut illustrates three distinct moments from the ballad: 1. In the foreground, the woodcut depicts Titus killing the Queen's sons and draining their blood into a basin that Lavinia holds. Next to Titus's revenge act, the woodcut shows the Moor to the side as having been half-buried, standing up in the ground. 2. In the background, the woodcut illustrates Lavinia writing the names of her rapists/mutilators in the dirt with a stick balanced between the stumps of her arms. 3. And, in a frame on the right side of the woodcut, the broadside displays the Queen and the Emperor about to eat a pie.\n\n\n== References ==",

He represented York in the House of Commons of Canada as an Independent Liberal from 1868 to 1883.\nHe was born in Douglas, New Brunswick in 1824 and began work with his father there. He later established himself as a merchant in Fredericton and a lumber merchant in York County. In partnership with Thomas Temple, he owned and operated a sawmill at Fredericton. He helped found the People's Bank of New Brunswick in 1864 and a director of the New Brunswick Railway. In 1865, he ran against Charles Fisher in York as an opponent of Confederation and was defeated. He was elected to represent York in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in an 1867 by-election after Fisher ran for a seat in the House of Commons. When Fisher was appointed judge, Pickard was elected to the federal parliament in an 1868 by-election. He supported Alexander Mackenzie during Mackenzie's term as prime minister.\nHe died in Fredericton in 1883.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"John Pickard\". Dictionary of Canadian Biography (online ed.).

    "Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Winnipeg": "The Archeparchy of Winnipeg is a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ecclesiastical territory or archeparchy  of the Catholic Church in Manitoba, a province of Canada. Currently, its archeparch is Lawrence Huculak.\nIts cathedral is the Cathedral of Sts. Vladimir and Olga in the episcopal see of Winnipeg, Manitoba  Sts. Vladimir and Olga are the patron saints of the Cathedral.  In Ukrainian Catholic churches the patron saint of the Church is generally represented behind the altar.  Sts. Vladimir and Olga are the ones who introduced Christianity to Ukraine, and it is appropriate that the first Ukrainian Church in Winnipeg is placed under their patronage. Among the locations under the archeparchy's administration is Bishop Velychkovsky Martyr\u2019s Shrine, also in Winnipeg.\nThe archeparchy oversees all Ukrainian Greek Catholic parishes in Manitoba. As of 2010, the archeparchy contained 136 parishes, 32 active diocesan priests, 11 religious priests, and 29,700 Ukrainian Greek Catholics. It also has 23 religious sisters, 11 religious brothers and 12 permanent deacons. It operates a number of parochial schools in the city of Winnipeg jointly with the Latin Archdiocese of Saint Boniface.\n\n\n== History ==\n \nNestor Dmytriw, the first Ukrainian Greek Catholic priest in Canada, having started parishes in 1897 and 1898 in Terebowla, Manitoba, Stuartburn, Manitoba and Edna, Alberta, advocated a separate territory for Ukrainian Greek Catholics in Canada, but this idea was opposed by the existing Latin Canadian Catholic hierarchy. His vision came to fruition on 15 June 1912 when the Holy See established in Winnipeg the Apostolic Exarchate of Canada and Nykyta Budka was appointed its first Exarch (missionary bishop) for Ukrainians in Canada, in response to the success of pretend Bishop Seraphim (Stefan Ustvolsky) in organizing Ukrainians interested in the liturgical traditions of their heritage.\nOn 19 January 1948, it was renamed as Apostolic Exarchate of Central Canada, having lost vast territories to establish the Apostolic Exarchate of Western Canada and the Apostolic Exarchate of Eastern Canada. In 1951, it was again renamed as Apostolic Exarchate of Manitoba, having lost territory again to establish the Apostolic Exarchate of Saskatoon. On 3 November 1956, it finally lost its missionary pre-diocesan and exempt status (until then, it had been immediately subject to the Holy See) when promoted directly to metropolitan status as the Archeparchy of Winnipeg.\n\n\n== Ecclesiastical province ==\nIts ecclesiastical province in Canada includes the metropolitan's archeparchy and the following suffragan eparchies:\n\nUkrainian Catholic Eparchy of Edmonton\nUkrainian Catholic Eparchy of New Westminster\nUkrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saskatoon\nUkrainian Catholic Eparchy of Toronto and Eastern Canada.\n\n\n== Bishops ==\n\n\n=== Diocesan ordinaries ===\nApostolic Exarch of CanadaBlessed Nykyta Budka (1912.07.15 \u2013 1927), Titular Bishop of Patara (1912.07.15 \u2013 1949.10.01), later Auxiliary Bishop of Lviv of the Ukrainians (Ukraine) (1928 \u2013 death 1949.10.01)Apostolic Exarch of Central CanadaBasil Ladyka, Basilian Order of Saint Josaphat O.S.B.M.

    "Pentecostal Mission": "The Pentecostal Mission (TPM) or New Testament Church (NTC) in USA or Universal Pentacostal Church ( UPC) in UK   is a Pentecostal denomination which was founded in Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in 1923. The international headquarters is now situated in Irumbuliyur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.  It now has churches in over 65 countries operating under various names.  There are over 2 Million members in this Church, around the world. It was before known as Ceylon Pentecostal Mission (CPM) .\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church was founded by Pastor Paul Ramankutty, who was born to Hindu parents in the district of Trichur in Kerala, India. While in Sri Lanka, at the age of 18, he became a Christian. Later, he felt a strong call and began to preach and share the gospel in various parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Sri Lanka, working with other evangelists.  In 1923 he founded the church with name Ceylon Pentecostal Mission, later changed to The Pentecostal Mission.\n\n\n== Church leadership ==\n\nThe church is led by a Chief Pastor (currently Abraham Mathew). In addition, there is a Deputy Chief Pastor (currently M.T Thomas) and an Associate Deputy Chief Pastor (currently G. Jeyam).\nIn the United States most of the church work was pioneered by the late Don M Spiers, who had previously worked closely with Oral Roberts. Gregg Wilson now heads the work in USA and countries around the USA. He is assisted by the sister-in-charge Lisa Billow.\nFull-time ministers are expected to practice an ascetic lifestyle including celibacy, obedience to the elder pastors, communal living (including disposal of private possessions) in faith homes.\nTPM churches are run by full-time ministers who are celibate and predominantly single. Married couples who enter full-time ministry can become celibate and may be sent to different locations by the TPM leadership if they so choose.\n\n\n== Doctrines and teachings ==\nThe doctrines of the church broadly align with trinitarian Pentecostalism.\n\n\n== Magazine ministry ==\nMagazines are produced in several languages. The English language magazine published from India is called The Voice of Pentecost. Pilgrim's Journal is published and printed in the USA. Other English language magazines are Pentecostal Messenger from Malaysia, The Youth Herald from Singapore, Power Divine from Sri Lanka, and Trumpet of the Lord from the UK.\nChurch Magazines are being published in more than forty Indian languages and other foreign languages. Malayalam magazine Pentecost is one of the oldest Pentecostal magazines from Kerala. A Hindi edition Pentecost Ki Wani published from New Delhi, Tamil edition named Pentecosthin Peroli from Irumbilyur (Chennai), Pentecost-Chi Vaani from Mumbai, and Pentecost Da Sneha from Dhariwal (Punjab) are also produced.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChristianity in Sri Lanka\n\n\n== References ==",

    "POU4F1": "POU domain, class 4, transcription factor 1 (POU4F1) also known as brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3A (BRN3A), homeobox/POU domain protein RDC-1 or Oct-T1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the POU4F1 gene.BRN3A (POU4F1) is a class IV POU domain-containing transcription factor highly expressed in the developing peripheral sensory nervous system (dorsal root ganglia, trigeminal ganglion, and hindbrain sensory ganglia), certain regions of the central nervous system, retinal neurons called ganglion cells, and in cells of the B- and T-lymphocytic lineages.\n\n\n== Discovery ==\nBrn3a was initially discovered in mice based on homology to the prototypal POU transcription factors Pit1 (Pituitary-specific positive transcription factor 1, Pou1f1), Oct1 (Pou2f1), and the Caenorhabditis elegans factor Unc86, and named Brn3. When multiple members of the Brn3 gene class were discovered, it was renamed Brn3.0 and Brn3a by different groups of researchers.  Subsequently, the gene was systematically renamed Pou4f1 in mice and POU4F1 in humans.  The protein product is still frequently referred to as Brn3a.\n\n\n== Function ==\nIn addition to sensory neurons, in rodents and birds (and presumably humans) Brn3a is expressed in multiple sites in the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, midbrain superior colliculus, red nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, inferior olivary nucleus, habenula, and retina.Mice with null mutations (\"knockouts\") in Brn3a die at birth, due to developmental defects in the nucleus ambiguus, which is essential for respiration.Brn3a is a transcription factor which acts in development by regulating downstream \"target\" genes.  Microarrays have been used to determine many genes downstream of Brn3a in peripheral sensory neurons.In the sensory neurons Brn3a is co-expressed with the LIM domain transcription factor ISL1 or Islet1, and has many downstream targets in common with Isl1. Pou4f1/Isl1 double mutant mice show strong epistatic effects in regulation of many downstream genes in the sensory neurons of double mutant mouse embryos.Although the homozygous Brn3a null mutation is lethal at birth in mice, Brn3a null heterozygotes have no known phenotype. i.e. the Brn3a null mutation is completely recessive.  This can be explained by gene dosage compensation due to autoregulation, in which expression of the remaining copy of the Pou4f1 gene is increased in heterozygotes, leading to near-normal expression of its downstream targets. The combination of homozygote lethality and dosage compensation in heterozygotes may explain why POU4F1 mutations have not been identified in any human disease, whereas diseases are associated with several other members of the POU domain transcription factor class.\n\n\n== Interactions ==\nPOU4F1 has been shown to interact with Estrogen receptor alpha, RIT2 and Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBRN-3\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPOU4F1+protein,+human at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)This article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine, which is in the public domain.",

    "Teleostomi": "Teleostomi is an obsolete clade of jawed vertebrates that supposedly includes the tetrapods, bony fish, and the wholly extinct acanthodian fish. Key characters of this group include an operculum and a single pair of respiratory openings, features which were lost or modified in some later representatives.  The teleostomes include all jawed vertebrates except the chondrichthyans and the extinct class Placodermi.\nRecent studies indicate that Osteichthyes evolved from placoderms like Entelognathus, while acanthodians are more closely related to modern chondrichthyes. Teleostomi, therefore, is not a valid, natural clade, but a polyphyletic group of  species.The clade Teleostomi should not be confused with the similar-sounding fish clade Teleostei.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe origins of the teleostomes are obscure. They are traditionally assumed to be descendants of the Acanthodians (\"spiny sharks\") from the Early Silurian Period; however, more recent discoveries show that the \"spiny sharks\" are actually a paraphyletic assemblage leading to Chondrichthyes, and that placoderms like Entelognathus are more closely related to true bony fish.  Living teleostomes constitute the clade Euteleostomi, which includes all osteichthyans and tetrapods.  Even after the acanthodians perished at the end of the Permian, their euteleostome relatives flourished such that today they comprise 99% of living vertebrate species.\n\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\nTeleostomes have two major adaptations that relate to aquatic respiration. First, the early teleostomes probably had some type of operculum; however, it was not the one-piece affair of living fish. The development of a single respiratory opening seems to have been an important step. The second adaptation, the teleostomes also developed a primitive lung with the ability to use some atmospheric oxygen.  This developed, in later species, into the lung and (later) the swim bladder, used to keep the fish at neutral buoyancy.Acanthodians share with Actinopterygii the characteristic of three otoliths, the sagitta in the sacculus, the asteriscus in the lagena, and the lapillus in the utriculus. In dipnoans there are only two otoliths and in Latimeria there is only one.However, most of the above synapomorphies can ultimately be found in several chondrychthyian groups.\n\n\n== Relationships ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAcanthodii\nEuteleostomi\n\n\n== References ==",
